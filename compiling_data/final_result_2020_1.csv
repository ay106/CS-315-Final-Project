And by doing that, they were able to make millions of dollars. Would that be okay with you? Signed out one of the United States largest insurance carriers does exactly this. According to an article recently published, there are claims that sigma has a built-in system to allow their doctors to reject insurance claims without even reviewing a patient's chart. Doctors have denied over 300,000 requests in two months using this method. They have an algorithm that will flag mismatches between diagnosis and what they consider an acceptable test. They can then sign off on these denials in large batches. Per reports, they can deny up to 50 requests in 10 seconds. According to insurance laws in many states, a company doctor must review the patient's chart prior to denying medical services. This ultimately leaves patients with large bills and sicknesses that the tests are not medically necessary. Leave your thoughts in the comments section.",subjective

If you receive a denial from your insurance company, you have the right to appeal that decision. A denial can be something as simple as your doctor may not have provided the information to your insurance company that they needed to make that approval. Or the diagnosis code did not match the appropriate test that was ordered. So don't just accept that denial, fight it. Step one, find out why your claim was denied. Before you submit an appeal, you need to understand why it was denied. You can request that letter from your insurance company. It may be because the inappropriate documentation was provided by your doctor's office. Your plan may not cover the service that you are asking for. The service may have been deemed medically not necessary. That word literally for me is like nails on a chalkboard. Your plan may not cover that provider or you've reached the maximum coverage of your plan. Step two, contact your insurance company to ask about the appeals process and the steps that you need to take to do so. You'll need to follow these steps very carefully. Step three is call your doctor. If the appropriate paperwork was not submitted or the inappropriate code was provided, your doctor can submit that to get the claim overturned. And if the claim was denied for another reason, you can let your doctor know that you plan on filing an appeal. And your doctor can help you do that. I try to fight for any appeal that I feel like is unnecessary for any of my patients. Step four is collect all the paperwork that you need for the appeal. That may be the denial letter, office visits notes, bills, and other documents related to the service. Your summary of benefits from your insurance company or any other paperwork that you plan to submit on your behalf. Remember, you are your biggest advocate. Step five is submitting an internal appeal. That's a claim directly to your insurance company asking them to overturn that decision. Even though you may be angry or upset, trust me, I am too. Leave your emotions out of that letter and explain exactly why you need coverage. Step six is wait for the results of the internal appeal. That may take up to 30 days. And if it's an urgent appeal for an urgent matter, they have to give you a decision within 72 hours. If the internal appeal is denied, step seven is to file an external appeal. You can submit your case to an independent third party for an external appeal. That's someone that doesn't work for the insurance company that can review your case and give a decision. More information on how to do that should be in your explanation of benefits. And remember, an external appeal costs your insurance company money. The more claims that go through the external appeal may mean better coverage in the future for that particular procedure. That's a 100-foot view on how many patients that file external appeals can actually overturn policy coverage on a particular procedure.",subjective

You see oftentimes people get rabies because they get bit by a wild or feral animal. And when they get bit, the rabies virus gets transmitted. Initially they are going to have non-specific symptoms like fever or chills. But if rabies is not treated properly, that virus spreads and then they can present with late state symptoms like hydrophobia, which is a fear of drinking water. And it happens because when they drink water, the neck muscles actually spasm and they contract paradoxically, which creates a lot of pain.

As a research professional, this is one of the most important things to familiarize yourself with. Unless you're working in a regulatory position, you're not going to be the one completing this form, but you still need to understand what it is and why it's important. I started this account to teach people about clinical research, so I think it's important to cover topics that I wish I was taught early in my career. I know it may be difficult to see all the elements of the 1572 on your screen, but you can Google search a copy since it's a public FDA form. To begin, the 1572 is important because it is a legally binding document between the sponsor, the investigator, and FDA. The 1572 is where you will enter all the clinical traumas. Each study site needs to complete one for each clinical trial they're working on. However, if there are several sites working together, like a healthcare system with multiple clinics, then the mean site is the one that completes it. The other sites are referred to as satellite sites and they will be entered under section 3 of the 1572. Now let's start from the top. Section 1 is where the principal investigators information will be at. They are responsible for everything at the site level. Section 2 is where you select how you will prove that the investigator is qualified to run the trial. It will virtually always be the CV because the CD will show their experience. Section 3 is where you would enter the clinics where research will be done. You'll also enter here any pharmacies that are not a part of the clinic. These are called central pharmacies and there were the study drug is shipped and stored. Section 4 is self-explanatory. You'll enter the laboratories that you'll use. You'll also need to enter any central laboratories. These are the laboratories that the study sponsor uses when you ship them specimen samples. Section 5 is where you will enter the institutional review board information. In studies you will mostly use a central IRB chosen by the sponsor but some academic sites will use their local IRBs. Section 6 is where you enter any other doctors and providers that will be working on the study. There are no now sub investigators or sub-is. Mid-level providers can be sub-is but all PIs have to be doctors. Section 7 is where you simply enter the study name. Section 8 is where you select the phase of the study. In clinical trials there are four phases of studies. Comment below if you'd like me to make a separate video explaining the phases. Section 9 is very important. Here is where you will read the investigators' responsibilities as PI. Section 10 is where the PI will sign. It's important to notice that the date format is month, day, year. This format is used in research and if it's not written in this format the sponsor will reject it.",subjective

How to keep people from knowing what they got? See, when you sign up for one of these trials as a subject, you are told that they are testing a psychedelic drug. They have to tell you that because it can't just be a surprise that it's LSD and suddenly you're tripping for eight hours straight. But what you're not told on purpose is whether you're going to be in the drug group or in the control group that gets a placebo. You're not supposed to know what you got. This is called blinding and ideally, both you and the person giving you the drug should be blind to what it is. But the problem is in psychedelic studies, it's pretty obvious whether you're in the treatment group or in the placebo group. I mean, it happens all the time. In this study, they gave people either ayahuasca or placebo and then they actually asked them to guess what they think they got. No surprise, 100% of the people in the trial guessed correctly. This is problematic because having a good control group is super important. In many drug trials, the people in the placebo group actually show some sort of treatment effect, probably because there's some expectation that they're going to get better and they have no idea whether they got the treatment or the placebo. If the placebo group can tell that they're in the placebo group, then it could affect the way that they respond. To get around this, scientists will sometimes give an active control, something that does cause some sort of response, usually itching or tingling or something like that.

And it's really difficult to answer because public health has such a big range of things that pertain to public health. For example, the American Public Health Association defines public health as basically anything that promotes and protects the health of people in the communities in which they live, learn, work, and play. So you can tell that the definition is super broad. So public health can include things that are kind of obvious like having access to doctors and nurses, but also things like medical supplies and medications. But public health also consists of things that we don't typically think about. For example, obesity and type 2 diabetes is a huge problem in the US, and so food and nutritious food and making sure people have access to good food is also within the purview of public health. And also includes things like housing and education because we know that those things are related to health outcomes. Public health also includes research looking at how common certain diseases are, and also looking at the best methods to stamp out these diseases, whether they're infectious or non-infectious. So you don't necessarily have to study public health to get involved in public health, but I wanted some extra training in particular, and that would drove me to get a master's degree before studying medical school.",subjective

So but a nurse said that advance plans are not good. I don't get it basically. So I'm going to use the little whiteboard and kind of walk you through this. So maybe it'll come more to life and be clear. Okay, hold on. So when you are signing up for A and B, don't forget that that is with the government, right? You're paying $170 and 10 cents, which is the base rate this year for Medicare. So when you pay for that, you're getting A and B and all that it covers and they're going to pay 80% of your health care. Okay. So for this fee, you buy A and B that covers certain amount of things and it doesn't cover certain amount of things. Again, 80% coverage. So when you're hearing things like you're going to get extra benefits and things like that, all this extra from these Medicare Advantage plans, it is technically true. So what's going to happen is you're going to add a PPO, let's say and it's a Medicare Advantage plan. We call those MAPD. And then in that, because remember A and B, it does not cover prescriptions. Well, Medicare Advantage plans with prescription drugs. This PD portion is prescription drugs. That is adding drug coverage or coverage to your world. So therefore, is it technically more than A and B? Yes, it is. If your MAPD plan also covers dental, well, guess what? Medicare A and B doesn't cover dental. So are you technically adding more than you had before? You sure are. Okay. So the list goes on. So all those bells and whistles, get rid of that. All the bells and whistles that all of these MAPD plans can add are extra. So technically that is correct. Very often these cost $0 per month, right? You do have copays, you've got networks, you've got different kind of restrictions, but you get all that for zero. So technically, they are adding more than A and B. So that's what that's meaning. Now what the nurse is talking about probably is the fact that you now have networks, you've got certain limitations that you don't have with original Medicare. So with Medicare A and B, you very rarely will have a prior authorization request. Well, when you go into this MAPD situation, guess what? The carrier can require prior authorization for things. So there's a trade-off. And all you have to do is look at is the trade-off worth it to you. Are you gaining all of this? You've got to be okay with giving up a couple of things, but that is what you're gaining. So that's what they're talking about. So you're trading and gaining some things, but you do have some restrictions entering your world, okay? Does that help? Comments? Questions? Hopefully, that's a little more clear.

They are on the rise. 11 states plus New York and Puerto Rico are experiencing high or very high levels of respiratory illness activity. There are a few reasons why and here to break it all down is ABC News Medical Correspondent, Dr. Darian Sutton, good to see you. Glad you're here. Okay, so it's that time of year. We've got a lot of coughing. We've got a lot of sneezing. What's behind this rise? So what we know is that we're seeing an increased rate of children presenting to local emergency departments with cough, fever, runny nose, all these symptoms of common respiratory infections. That is true, but what also is reassuring and I'm discussing with and following with the WHO, the CDC and my emergency medicine colleagues across the nation is that the pathogens, the bacteria, the viruses that are causing these infections are not new. Things like RSV, flu, COVID, and then other common causes like adenovirus and strep pneumoniae are commonly the reasons why these children come in with these symptoms. The reasons why they're coming in now is probably a multitude of things, including cold weather, increased travel. We also have evidence that COVID decreases our immune response, which makes us more susceptible to infection. And even certain infections like Michael Plasma, which has reportedly been found in China, sometimes surge every few years. So we're seeing probably an unfortunate coincidence of all these factors, a lot of these numbers are increasing. And I know you're also following these increased numbers of childhood pneumonia. Yes. So what do parents need to know about that? I think it's really short and simple, examining your child. It's very common for children to have respiratory infections, especially during the winter time. So for infants, if they're having difficulty like if they're grunting, if they're wheezing, if their skin is changing. Or if you notice that they're belly breathing, when they're having deep breaths, or their abdomen is moving instead of their chest, those are signs of respiratory distress that need to be evaluated. For older children, talk to them. If they're taking a lot of breaks in between their sentences, or if you notice that they are wheezing, or if they're having a lot of difficulty catching their breath, these are also reasons. But for the most part, Gio, you can treat your symptoms from the comfort of your own home, basic fever-reducing medications, water, hydration. These are key things that you need to keep important. Important to know that. So how do we stay safe? This is very simple. We have to all pay attention, washing our hands, of course, bringing our masks when we're in high-risk environments, getting updated and our flu and our COVID vaccines. And then taking advantage of those free COVID tests that are available with United States at COVIDTest.gov, bringing those home and making sure that if you finding that your test is negative in the first few days, test again, 28, excuse me, 24 to 48 hours later, just to make sure.

So I figured since I came on here and said how I went blind Due to drugs. I figured I would come on here and just say how I got on them in the first place at 11 years old When I was 11 there was a lot of issues at home with parent my parent and my step-parent at the time and It just all blew up and this is also after years of you know just a lot of turbulence throughout my childhood and stuff like that so when I was 11 I a big incident happened and I ended up getting put into the system and whenever I got put into the system I was Put into an emergency shelter for kids, you know that didn't that were in their for all kinds of reasons, you know and horrible reasons that that There was this I was 11 and there was this 16 year old girl and She kept trying to dittle me and I didn't Want that to happen so it didn't you know and She ended up getting like Matting me I guess for different things and she ended up smacking me in my face and then it just became like a very turbulent Immediately from an already turbulent situation like I mean I had never been taken away from my parent so like this was It an extremely intense situation already so when chicks started doing all that Very quickly like I got there on Friday on a Friday I believe and By Monday when I went to school I ran away at the end of the school day and I was Walking around and walking around and by the time it was about nine o'clock at night or so it was dark and everything this guy he picked me up and He said his name was Cody and he said he was 27 years old, I believe and You know, I just told him that I was a runaway and you know just like all the shit that was happening and It It I don't know so I'm sure he already kind of his Adult sick brain was already like probably his wheels were turning and you know, I was a kid and it was just Whatever really bad situation so I ended up he ended up like driving around with me he ended up getting some wild turkey whiskey and He said he had some lower tabs and I was like why not you know what I mean and so I went ahead and drank some whiskey and I took some pills and You know the pills I didn't feel nothing off of them. I barely sipped through the whiskey So I really didn't feel much off of that and then he ended up Lincoln me with this prostitute that he knew from the local area very trash crashed out lady who her name was Joy and Go figure and She was about 37 she said Who knows the truth right? I mean she looked it there. She looked older just teeth all just cracked out right just cracked out lady and She so he he put me in connection with her because he had to go home and I needed somewhere to stay and so I stayed with her I lost my virginity that night to that man and He gave her the money that I guess he paid for my virginity on my 11-year-old virginity um And then after this I ended up getting with a couple more Men that night like right well right after that it was it was one more man and then after that We went to another man's house that she had she knew because you know she was from this area and was a deeply invested hooker and crack edit in the area so She so I'm sorry. I'm really jumbly because I'm not very good at this, but I hope to become better um So so she ended up taking me to this guy's house and I went in the room with him of course did what I did and you know just another another client customer whatever I wouldn't call it client. I don't even know customer trick whatever right and None of these dudes had any issue with my age like nothing like some of them didn't even ask you know And I was obviously a child, but that's not even the point right that's not even the point of this It is a point, but it's not the point and so I Went into the kitchen with with the lady after I you know got with that man who's an old man He was like he had to have been in his like early 50s Maybe at least at the very least was just terrible and I went in the kitchen with her and she said have you ever done this before and um I was like what is it she was like it's crack and As they know when she loaded it up fixed the brillo Put the blast on the pipe and I smoked crack for the first time that night um Say night I lost my virginity and sold my soul to the devil you might as well say um and You know my whole point in making the TikTok that I've made is to eventually um, I don't know get better at talking and Maybe lead towards a place where I can help other people that have been in similar situations or through similar lifestyles And especially the children. I mean there's so many children that are going through this today right now You know and that's what matters, you know The fact that I went through stuff doesn't matter Because I'm already through it, you know, and where I am today is what matters and where those babies that are out there right now are at Right now matters all of them and I think it's just a terrible situation and I think a lot of people aren't um as aware or knowledgeable as they should be about that kind of world and how little Of Crafts people give even about someone being a child or Like that that whole world is just full of so much um Evil just complete evil and um You know, I'm grateful to be here today.

In what you're seeing, our respiratory therapists, they're about to test the ability to be able to excavate them. That is a process in which the breathing tube is removed. And before we do that, we actually got to make sure that the reason for why you got intubated has been resolved. There's many reasons for why someone needs a breathing tube. Often that's because they need short support because they have a pneumonia that's so severe that they can get oxygen appropriately. Or sometimes they're so altered that they might need to protect their way because they have saliva, they could choke on it and get a pneumonia. So there's many different reasons for him. He had cardiac surgery. And so part of the process to recover is him having a breathing tube. Sometimes if we're not able to remove the breathing tube and it's been more than 10 days, the next step would be possibly getting a tracheostomy in which we put a breathing tube in your trachea directly and we connect it to the ventilator.

Right now, federal law MTALA requires hospital providers to offer stabilizing medical care to anyone experiencing a medical emergency in their emergency room. This includes abortion and of course that's where this case comes in. It's called Idaho versus the United States and in this case the Supreme Court is going to address weather states like Idaho that have strict abortion bans can bypass an override federal law and refuse to perform abortions even if somebody needs it in a medical emergency and it's threatening their life. If the court rules an Idaho's favor that means that if someone's experiencing a medical emergency and needs something like an abortion the hospital would no longer be required to provide that service. Obviously the consequences of that are far reaching and catastrophic and horrific, especially when you consider that medical emergency as a really wide spectrum that is not limited to just reproductive care. But I think this illustrates how far anti-abortion activists are willing to go and how they're using every facet of our legal system to try to exert control over our bodies. Everyone who's experiencing a medical emergency deserves access to the care that they need including abortion and in fact MTALA exists because Congress passed it like 40 years ago when people that were pregnant and people who were living with HIV and AIDS were being denied essential services.

That's because of a federal law that's been on the book since 1993 and is getting a burst of scrutiny right now. With it mandating that all states recoup Medicaid expenses by seasonly assets of dead people who receive long-term care through the program before they die. And in many cases, that includes their homes, which you might say is already cruel enough on its own. But what makes it so much worse is that many people actually have no idea that their property is on the chopping block when they sign up for Medicaid. Like this woman in Tennessee whose mother suffered from Alzheimer's. She told the AP that she initially cared for the mother on her own. But then when she herself was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015, she had to turn to Medicaid for help. With a representative from her local office advising her to drain her mother's bank accounts so she would qualify for Medicaid, which she did. And she used those funds to pay for an assisted living facility. But she had no idea that when her mother died in 2021, Tennessee would send her a bill for $225,000, as well as seeking to force her to pay by selling the home. And notably with it, she says it's not just about the money for her. It's saying her mother, a black woman, purchased this dream home after she won a discrimination lawsuit against Boeing. Right, so you have this daughter saying, she fought hard for equal pay and equal rights just to see that ripped away just because she was sick and I was sick. It's just absolutely devastating. And the thing is, this program doesn't even bring in that much money. It turns out states only collect around 1% of the more than 150 billion dollars Medicaid spends yearly on long-term care. So for the states, that money is like a drop in the bucket. But for these families, it's everything. But follow to stay in the loop.",subjective

But the later hemorrhagic and organ stages cause things like internal external bleeding, the lack of an ability for blood plots to form, and all sorts of other things until you eventually succumb. At this stage, we don't have any vaccines, but we do have some that are currently in trials, and we do have ways to treat people.",objective

These nurse case managers are quietly behind the scenes helping patients maximize the benefits through the insurance company. Many insurance companies have case managers that are available to patients and many people don't know that it exists. For instance, Medicaid supplemental and many Medicare advantage plans have case managers on staff to help with patient needs. These nurses are trained to know the insurance benefit inside and out and it is very beneficial to patients and others on a patient's care team to know how to contact a case manager. You can get a case manager on board. You can ask for one to be assigned to your patient or one might already be assigned to your patient. You just have to call the insurance company and ask. The case managers can help approve out-of-network tests or treatment plans. They can also help with other transportation issues, social determinants of health. They can assign a social worker possibly. I mean the it's endless. The possibilities are endless. Patients who would benefit from having a case manager would be high-risk patients in general. So patients who go to the hospital frequently use the ER frequently, don't have a primary care doctor or don't have one established. Patients who have multiple comorbidities who need help managing just their overall health in general, non-compliance. So those are the types of patients that would benefit from having a case manager assigned to them through their insurance company. All right, have a good day!",subjective

I'm used to having a rocking roll band behind me when I have a microphone in front of me. During the time that I've been given the share of my testimony here, I think it's important to note before I start that in these five minutes I'll be speaking that somebody in the United States will die of a drug overdose and it is almost a 72% chance that during those five minutes it will be fentanyl related. Having started that way, Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott, and the Stene Committee members, thank you for having me. I know this is a bit of a curveball, but I like a little baseball myself. My name is Jason D4, but to most I am known as Jelly Roll. It is important to establish earlier that I am a musician and that I have no political alliance. I am neither Democrat nor Republican. In fact, because of my past, my right to vote has been restricted thus far. I have never paid attention to a political race in my life. Ironically, I think that makes me the perfect person to speak about this because fentanyl transcends partisanship and ideology gentlemen and women. This is a totally different problem. I was speaking outside to the media and I gave him a statistic that said 190 people a day overdose and die every single day in the United States of America. That is about a 737 plane. That's what about a 737 aircraft can carry. Could you imagine the national media attention it would get if they were reporting that a plane was crashing every single day and killing 190 people? Well, because it's 190 drug addicts, we don't feel that way. Because America has been known to bully and shame drug addicts instead of dealing and trying to understand what the actual root of the problem is with that. But the sad news is that that narrative is changing too because the statistics say that in all likelihood almost every person in this room has lost a friend, family member or colleague to the disease known as addiction. I've attended more funerals and I care to share with you all this committee. I could sit here and cry for days about the caskets. I've carried a people I love dearly, deeply in my soul. Good people, not just drug addicts, uncles, friends, cousins, normal people. Some people that just got in a car wreck and started taking a pain pill to manage it. One thing led to the other. How fast the spirals out of control. I don't think people truly, truly understand. So many people equally, I think it's important for me to tell you all that I'm not here to defend the use of illegal drugs. And I also understand the paradox of my history as a drug dealer standing in front of this committee. But equally, I think that's what makes me perfect to talk about this. I was a part of the problem. I am here now standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution. I brought my community down. I hurt people. I was the uneducated man in the kitchen playing chemists with drugs. I knew absolutely nothing about just like these drug dealers are doing right now when they're mixing every drug on the market with fentanyl and they're killing the people we love. I'll be honest with y'all my desires only get older and only do better and be better. I believed when I sold drugs genuinely that selling drugs was a victimless crime. I truly believe that, y'all. My father always told me what doesn't get you in the wash will get you in the rinse. Now I have a 15 year old daughter whose mother is a drug addict. Every day I get to look in the eyes of a victim in my household of the effects of drugs every single day. And every single day I have to wonder me and my wife if today will be the day that I have to tell my daughter that her mother became a part of the national statistic. History repeats itself gentlemen. Even in the 1990s crack cocaine had long made its way into my middle lower class neighborhood. And at that moment even as a teenager you could have never convinced me in that moment that there would be a far bigger problem on the horizon in the form of a pharmaceutical drug and then I watched opioids and oxy cotton burst onto the scene. I'm here to tell y'all that fentanyl is going to make the saccola family look like saints. And I want to let y'all sit with that for a second. It is time for us to be proactive and not reactive. We were reactive with crack. We were reactive with opioids and y'all are taking the first step. It's somebody in senate finally being proactive. I truly believe in my heart to this bill that this bill will stop the supply and can help stop the supply of fentanyl. But in part of being proactive gentlemen and women and ladies I have to be frank and tell y'all that if we don't talk to the other side of Capitol Hill and stop the demand we are going to spend our tires in the mud. I'm sure you are taking the first step but I encourage you to take it outside of this room and you take it to your colleagues and your constituents and you give them the most that you can. I know I've got a few seconds here and Senator Brown said I may or may not go over. All I want to say is that I not only encourage y'all to do this I encourage y'all to take a step further. At every concert I perform I witness the heartbreaking impact of fentanyl. I see fans grappling with this tragedy in the form of music that they seek solace and music and hope that their experiences won't befall others. They crave reassurance. These are the people I'm here to speak for y'all. These people crave reassurance that their elected officials actually care more about human life than they do about ideology and partisanship. I stand here as a regular member of society. I am a stupid songwriter y'all but I have first hand witness this in a way most people have not. I encourage y'all to not only pass this bill but I encourage you to bring it up where it matters at the kitchen table. Thank you for your time.",subjective

You may be wondering what that actually means, so let's talk about it. The term walking pneumonia is not actually a medical term, the medical term would be a typical pneumonia. Just like any other infection of the lung, which is typically called pneumonia, walking pneumonia is also an infection of the lung, but it is typically a mild case of pneumonia. And it's often caused by a bacterium called Michael Plasma pneumonia. The symptoms of this condition are typically mild, mild enough meaning that people can continue to do their daily activities hence the term walking pneumonia. Now that's not always true walking pneumonia can take you out. Signs and symptoms are pretty typical of any other lung infections such as cough, fever, chest pain, chills, headache, etc. And it is spread in the same way any other respiratory illnesses and the same precautions therefore apply. Thankfully most people will recover if it just supportive care, but some might need antibiotics.",subjective

This video I'm going to go in in cliff notes of what they want to do with the Department of Health and Human Services. There's literally so much information in here. So if you guys want to read it in detail, I welcome you to go back. It's on project 2025.org. In essence, go number one protecting life conscious and bodily integrity. This is a pro life federal platform to nationalize a no abortion basically. They also talk about radical actors inside the government pushing gender ideology. So basically they're saying gender ideology and non binary people are not natural basically. That HHS has programs that should protect children's minds and bodies against society ideology. Go number two empowering patient choices and provider autonomy. This is a legal ease for privatization of health care. You remember in a video I talked about before about choice as how they're marketing to Americans. They're saying that private health care is the way to go. Any public offering is not in the best interest of people. Go number three promoting stable and flourishing married families. They're basically saying that the government incentivizes single motherhood, de incentivizes work and penalizes marriage and that fatherlessness is the reason why we have teen pregnancy, poor educational outcomes, etc. They think that not having a nuclear family is the reason why our society is in such disarray. Honestly, they believe this. Then they go into the next health emergency with the CDC and COVID-19 and how Fauci is a bureaucrat. Then they go into this whole thing about the CDC and the NIH and how there shouldn't be pharmaceutical companies involved in the testing and research and development, which a lot of people don't realize that a lot of advancements are done. They partner with our government to come up with some pretty cool stuff. It's why the COVID-19 vaccine was developed so quickly because it was in partnership with the government and private industry. Everyone has their opinions of whether that was the right thing to do. I think that it helps drive innovation. I mean, this is just more stuff about the CDC if you're interested. Then they go on to say the CDC should eliminate programs and projects that do not respect human life and conscious rights that undermine family formation. So abortion is anti-families, what they're saying. They want to reverse its approval of chemical abortion drugs. And this is the part that just gets me. Conservatives don't want the government to be able to negotiate pricing for medication. They say that it limits availability, which is just horseshit. It keeps their lobbyist rich when there's not competition. And they want to reform Medicare, probably in Medicaid, probably want to get rid of it totally. They want to privatize insurance. This is as much as I can do in three minutes, but go read the rest. If you're interested, it's madness.",subjective

Also if you have Medicaid mama and your baby has Medicaid or just your baby has Medicaid and you are in school or have a job you can apply for free daycare. Now you might not automatically get in the daycare but you'll at least be put on a waiting list and you will not be paying for the daycare. Another benefit that comes with Medicaid is WAKE which comes with milk, eggs, cheese, formula, everything for you if you're pregnant but when your baby comes you will also get formula for your baby if you are a formula feeding baby or if you're a mama that beats her baby formula. I combo feed so my baby has one formula bottle a day but I do not pay for it because Medicaid covers my WAKE. Another benefit is a gas card. So Medicaid gives you a gas card for WAKE appointments, doctors appointments anywhere, medically that you have to take your baby they will give you a gas card and put the amount of gas that you've used to go to those places. So if you don't have gas money to take your baby to the doctor whatever all you got to do is fill out a form. If you have Medicaid write me and I will send you the forms and all the information. There are so many benefits with Medicaid. They don't want you to know that because they don't want you to ask for them. My case worker, I'm not gonna say her name, the Medicaid she is amazing. She like gives me anything that'll help me she lets me know and I absolutely love that but also she's a mom so she gets it like she gets Jayles and a size of a one-dopper but I want to ask her to because why not? You know why not? Luckily I'm less than I have food but she's even asked me if I need to have food or you could own food so like there's so many benefits that you can get from Medicaid and if you're a pregnant mama and you don't have insurance, baby you need to go you can go to your health department and they have applications for Medicaid or you can contact the nearest Medicaid agency around you. It's okay to have help it's okay to ask for help. Yes my man supports this family of three very well but anyway that I can help him and save some money for us because we rent a home right now we don't own a home and we do have goals anyway I can help our family I'm going to. So yes I'm signing up for the gas card yes I have them send me toppers and yes I have WIC it's okay. I just wanted to help some mamas out on here today but if you got Medicaid listen to me and in some states Medicaid will pay for certain things and CBS or all Greens but when you have something you need to look up any little thing you can utilize with that it's not just health insurance they help you in multiple ways because there's mamas out there who don't have any help.",subjective

So first, the NIH Stroke Scale stands for National Institute of Health Stroke Scale Score and what it is is literally us finding a baseline for patients who exhibit symptoms or signs of stroke and it gives us a measure of assessment whether the patient is improving or declining. Every year or two nurses are required to have certifications renewed to show that they are capable of performing this NIH Stroke Scale and properly assessing patients. When obtaining our certification, as you see in the video, they show you actual patients and they perform the assessments. Usually the score of zero shows that the patient has no deficit, the score of one shows they have a mild deficit and a score of two is usually a severe deficit. At the end, it is all tallied up to get a score and for us to have some sort of baseline as to if the patient is improving or declining. There are also pictures in the assessment where the patient is asked to explain what's happening in the picture and based on certain damages and parts of the brain, they're not going to be able to interpret what they're seeing in this picture no matter how hard they try. They will be asked to say words and explain the items that they're seeing in these pictures and read the words off to the side. You'll be able to identify if there is slurred speech and intelligible speech or normal speech. Literally this is like the big assessment for all stroke patients or patients who exhibit signs of stroke so that we can assess what kind of rehabilitation services they might need or they need occupational therapy, physical therapies, speech therapy. You name it. This literally will tell you what area the patient is suffering the most in and how to help your patient and this also will tell you, you know, where is my patient at? Are they getting better? Are they getting worse? So it is very, very valuable tool. The patient I had for example yesterday had expressive aphasia which means that even though he can completely understand everything that is said to him and asked of him, he is incapable of answering. When I asked him his name, I said, do you know your name? He's like, of course I know my name and I was like, what is it? And he kind of stared up into space for a little bit. He knew his name but he could not verbalize what his name was. He knew that he needed to use the urinal but he could not tell me that it was the urinal that he needed so he would like kind of like fumble around in the bed until I finally was like, hey, do you have to pee? And he's like, yeah. So it is extremely important to find out these things when handing off the patient, especially one who suffered a stroke.",subjective

Instead of numbing the wound, patients continue taking these medications and some of them do become dependent, some have to deal with withdrawal and tolerance. If you are having an operation, simply talk to your doc about using X-Pro, a long acting and aesthetic. And especially if you went through that or deal with getting off narcotics and now you're concerned about taking them again, especially good reason to push a doctor and get this medication approved for your operation.

Okay, if there's any one video that you watch, hopefully it's this one. This patient ended up sharing her story that how she got sepsis and instead of going to sleep, she ultimately decided to go to the physician in that saved her life. So it's important that you understand what sepsis is. So in this video, I'll go over exactly what it is and what symptoms to watch out for. This is when you have a severe infection in your body. It could be a viral bacterial or fungus that leads to damage in your organs. That is called sepsis. And the reason behind that is that your body is trying to fight this infection, but it's having a hard time because it might not have the resources to fight it. Ultimately that leads to severe inflammation in your body that can lead to shock, meaning your blood pressure could go down and you might not be able to refuse vital organs leading to organischemia or damage in the vital organs such as a kidney, liver, heart or brain. There's multiple signs of sepsis. For instance, someone could be having fever's temperature of about 100.4 Fahrenheit or they could have low temperatures such as 95 degrees Fahrenheit or lower. They could have taken cardio, elevated heart rate. They could also have signs of the kidney or respiratory rate could be going up, trouble breathing. They could be altered, confused. All those signs are important to watch out for because those could be early signs of sepsis. So if you or anyone in your family or around you is having those signs, the most point that you got to do is take into the emergency room because if it's sepsis, they need to make sure they're getting fluid, they're getting antibiotics because that is life-saving treatment. Also, it's important to understand that time is of the essence because if you wait in you have sepsis, that could ultimately lead to death because sepsis is an infection that ultimately leads to blood pressure being low and causing you to have cardiac arrest in which your heart stops and you die. So it's important to understand that if you have any of these signs, make sure you talk to someone to take you to the emergency room or come on on one.",subjective

So anyone that has a Medicaid card, please go to your local CVS and see how much you have on your card because I'm sure a lot of you really don't know how much of a monthly allowance that you get. I'm telling you. And whatever amount is at the store does not include taxes. Like, the diapers that I just got were $14.99, but I got them for only $14 because it's not tax. Like, I just think that that's just bizarre that I didn't know this. And for two years, we could have been getting stuff from CVS. I just thought our Medicaid card was only for health insurance. Well, it's definitely not. So anybody that has a card, please go get your card checked and see how much money you have on it. Okay? Share this video to anybody that has Medicaid just so they know because a lot of people probably don't know. And I hope you guys have a great day.",subjective

Primero si no me conoces me llamó Daniela y me gusta que me digan Daniel, estoy empezando a crear contenido para mamitas primerizas en especial para las que vivimos en los Estados Unidos porque el sistema aquí es totalmente diferente al de nuestros países. Así que te invito a seguirme porque estaré compartiendo ciertos tips y te estaré dando conocer los beneficios que tenemos en este país. Hoy te voy a contar por lo que tuve que pasar al no saber que mi bebé tiene derecho tener un meryk, una vez nace en este país. En el hospital a se enfermeras te van a decir que ya me salas a la segurança y que metas a tu bebé en tu seguro médico si tienes uno. Si no tienes lo más probable es que te digan que puedes aplicar un meryk, pero si no te lo dicen hoy te lo voy a decir yo. Yo no sabía que podía aplicar en el hospital para el meryk y de mi bebé. Como me enteré porque resulta que cuando yo salí del hospital ya me da mi aseguranza. Voy a abrir un paréntesis. Yo tengo seguro médico hace tres años, siempre lo he pagado mensual. Cuando que en embarazo mis ingresos bajaron, por lo tanto ya no tuvo que pagar nada para mi seguro médico pero se quiten en la cobertura. Por lo tanto no perdí mi seguro, así que el día que nace mi bebé yo llamó a la segurança meta a mi bebé, me dice que ya lo incluyeron en mi aseguranza que una vez llegue sus socios de seguridad les deje saber para ellos colocarlo en el sistema. Así que mi seguro médico cubría el 80% del parto y también iba a cubrir el 80% de los gastos médicos de mi bebé. Y yo he aplicado a una ayuda financiera en el hospital que me cubrió el otro 20%. Por lo tanto yo no tenía que pagar absolutamente nada del parto ni los gastos médicos. En enero a mitad de enero me llaman de lo hospital, mi bebé nació en noviembre y en enero me llaman de lo hospital a decirme que mi bebé no tenía seguro médico y por lo tanto yo tenía una cuenta pendiente de 4.400 dólares que si deseaba ser un pago es el día. Obviamente yo que como de que me estás hablando siendoviembre yo metí a mi bebé en la segurança médica. Llamo a la segurança la señorita me dirige con otra persona y esta me explica que mi bebé no está en mi seguro médico porque mis ingresos califican para que él tenga médica. Así que ya me explica que si yo quiero que mi bebé esté en mi seguro médico la única manera es recibiendo una carta donde le rechacen el me de que a mi bebé. Así que ya en el aplicación y le dieron el me de que a mi bebé pero que sucede con la cuenta de 4.400 dólares que no cubrió el seguro médico el año pasado porque estoy aplicando en enero y mi bebé nació en noviembre. Yo obviamente le expuse este caso a la persona que me ayuda a aplicar a mi bebé. Por lo tanto ella me dijo que podía poner que mi bebé tenía cobertura desde noviembre para que se pudieran cubrir los gastos del parto de él de lo que se le hizo en el hospital a él el día en que nace porque son dos cuentas diferentes una cosa lo que te hacen a ti y otra cosa lo que le hacen a tu bebé. Así que cuando yo le informa al hospital que mi bebé tiene méricay que ya pueden meterlo para que cubren ese gasto ellos de incluyen pero ahorita estamos en febrero casi a finales de febrero y la cuenta sigue pendiente porque el proceso es totalmente diferente y es un poquito más largo pero pues ellos méricay me aseguró de que si van a cubrirle esos gastos de mi bebé de noviembre. Así que si tus ingresos califican para que tu bebé tenga méricay puedes hacer la aplicación en el hospital y ese mismo día o el día de la salida te van a entregar tu tarjetica del méricay de tu bebé. Esto no te va a afectar a ti absolutamente nada porque quien está aplicando el tu bebé y él al nacer en este país tiene derecho a aplicar y a tener un bebé.",subjective

According to FEMA Chief D. N. Crizzwell, the National Disaster Fund will run out at the end of August, unless Congress passes a $12 billion funding bill for natural disasters. The problem is that likely won't happen until Congress returns from recess after Labor Day. And some House Republicans have already said they opposed the request since it includes additional funding for Ukraine.

The ventilator gets hooked up way at the top of the breathing machine. The lower part of this tube goes between your vocal cords and at the very bottom is a little balloon that blows up to keep gastric contents getting from the stomach into the lungs. It also keeps a seal on the trachea so that the oxygen and the air can go directly into the lung. This is a pretty typical anesthesia machine which delivers up here the medications to keep you asleep as well as it is a ventilator at the same time. This is a pretty typical ventilator found in the intensive care unit.

So I got on my student public health and I've kind of worked all of the places. I started off working in science and research, but I wasn't really doing research. I was doing a lot of project management stuff. I was an analyst and then I became, I went into project managing as project management analyst and now I work in business development. So a question I get all the time is just more about like one what I do, but really it's more about like how I got my jobs. Honestly networking. When I say I'm very much an extremist with a lot of things, job search might be one of them. So when I was getting my masters, I literally my first semester, before I even got to campus, I got a graduate research experience. How did I do that? I literally set up meetings and call to talk to people and one of the people I spoke to directed me to the lady that I worked with shout out to Dr. Young. She was amazing. And I worked with her. The next semester, I still had that graduate citizenship and I got a different one working with African American Mews in the South and West out of Chicago. And I did that. I was working both of them. Then the summer. I then that summer, I got an internship. So I worked in the internship. So this is doing COVID. I was actually supposed to go abroad, but because of COVID and a big remote. And then I worked the same two internships when I came back. I think I worked all the graduate citizenship that summer and internships. I'm very extreme. And then and I was taking classes. And then the next year, the next summer, I did two internships. So I worked with the CDC foundation and another organization while taking classes and doing my capstone. Very extreme. So I say that to say, like, I stacked up my resume during grad school to make sure that when I walked out of there, I had a full resume. Like, I had a lot of stuff. And that is exactly what happened. I even went on consulting actually for the CC while I was job searching. The CDC foundation specifically. Yeah. So if you're job searching, you're in school. This is for people that are in school. Make sure you are getting the most out of that program going to school is not enough. Like you really need to work on getting like a lot of experiences while you're in school. And if you're out of school, make sure you finish. Make sure you, I won't say lie, your resume, but extend the truth. You know what I mean? Make sure you're quantifying your resume. Make sure you're connecting with people and things like that. But I will say to get this new job that I have now in business development. It took me about seven, six months. Actually, probably took me longer. I started this job. Just July last year. And I got the job in April. So I don't know, due to math. But yeah. So there's an old video I posted and I have a lot of comments on there. So I'm going to go back and I will do a series on working public health. I'm working public health.",subjective

Specifically today we're going to talk about sun protective shirts and sun hoodies. Covering up with clothing is the safest and easiest way to protect yourself from the harmful UV rays of the sun. And sun shirts or sun hoodies are designed and built for this job. Sun hoodies are a tip of clothing with a UPF rated breathable fabric and the shirts have actually been proven to keep you feeling cooler on hotter days. If you find yourself getting sunburned easily, sweating off all of your sunscreen or really sensitive and prone to heat exhaustion, then a sun hoodie will be your all-time favorite piece of gear. So let's get into some of my favorites. So our guide team here at Good Trip Avengers is fully outfitted every single day in the outdoor research echo hoodie. And this is by far one of the most lightweight and breathable sun hoodies that I have ever worn. It has really cool thumb holes which actually helps keep your hands protected from the sun, inclusive sizing, and I've never gotten sunburned in this shirt after really long days in the sun. There are a few cons to the sun hoodie however, they do have one of the lower UPF ratings about 15 to 20 depending on the color which is considered a lot lower than some of the others on the market. And because the fabric is incredibly soft, it is also not as durable and more prone to snagging. If you want to prioritize lightweight and breathable, then this should be your go-to. This is a classic, I'm sure you've seen so many people on the trails wearing the Patagonia capillain sun hoodie. Again, it's really effective at cooling and lightweight. It's very popular for a good reason. Patagonia claims that its UPF ranges anywhere from 17 to 45 depending on the colors. And this sun hoodie has at a much more affordable price point than some of the others at around $55. However, it does lack some of the features like those nifty thumb holes. And its fit is a little bit difficult to dial in. It best fits folks were looking for something fitted and who have a long torso, so this might not be everyone's cup of tea. And finally, we have Mountain Hardwares Criter Lake Hoodie which is rated for up to 50 plus UPF, which is one of the higher ones on the market. Hoodie itself is made out of an incredibly durable material and still maintains that lightweight and comfortable nature. And it is a bit more on the tight fitting side and it's not the most breathable, but it's a great option for folks looking for good sun protection. You like to hike in sun hoodies and if so, what's your favorite? You agree with our ratings? Let us know in the comments what gear you like to take with you on hot weather hikes to make sure that you have a good trip.",subjective

I did some digging and turns out not true and I'm like whoa whoa whoa what do you mean not true I mean this has to have stemmed from from something and it did it was an isolated event however a woman in Houston tech described a napkin that was stuffed into her car handle and her hands started going numb so she called the authorities and she was poisoned by something on that napkin but it was never confirmed that it was fentanyl and it was a confirm that it was a targeted event either. In fact fentanyl can't even be absorbed in your skin at all. Now I'm not saying for you to put your guard down when it comes to suspicious things being on your vehicles or gas pumps or whatever it is because at the end of the day pater fentanyl is a thing and it can be on objects and being held but there is zero data saying that this is a method that traffickers are using and actually I wouldn't be surprised if that's misinformation that's being spread by trafficker. Why? Because it takes away from what trafficking actually is. Being taken like in the movies and then brought into trafficking is extremely rare. In fact out of 365,000 missing children, 109,000 which is a third of those children were actually trafficked and even more crazy is that 60% of those missing children who were trafficked were foster kids. Wonder how that happened. So yes it absolutely can and does happen that way but the biggest battle that we're fighting is the one in our children's minds because the vast majority of trafficking is being done by someone that we know and trust. The more that we educate our children on how to overcome things like anxiety and insecurity, the less likely they are to be vulnerable to predators. We not only need to educate and have discussions with our children about healthy relationships but it is on us to exhibit them. While predators may fear me, they will never fear me as much as they do an educated child. Period.",subjective

In obstructive lung disease, we have a problem with air trapping. We can't get the air out. There is an obstruction to airflow. One example of obstructive lung disease is COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and there are two subcategories of that. We have chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This is what a normal bronchial should look like. Bronchials are the little tubes that transport air between your lung and your trachea, and eventually the atmosphere. In chronic bronchitis, the little bronchials are chronically inflamed and full of mucus, and air is getting trapped distal to them, past them in the lung. In emphysema, we have damage to the alveoli themselves. So instead of the little sacks being perfectly defined, the little grape clusters, the breakdown of the alveolar walls makes them extremely inefficient, floppy, hyperinflated, and gas gets trapped in these clusters. Not being able to get the air out means you can't ventilate effectively. In restrictive lung disease, we have a problem getting air in. Restrictive lung disease can be broken down into two main categories. In transit causes, meaning a problem with the lung tissue itself, or extrinsic causes, meaning there's something outside of the lung that is preventing the lung from expanding. So the main cause of intrinsic lung disease are interstitial lung diseases. Some sort of a problem with the interstitium, which is the space between the alveoli itself and the capillary. There are tons of diseases that fall under this category, but what they all have in common is there's some sort of inflammation going on in the lung tissue and the interstitium that causes permanent scarring and fibrosis. So the lung loses its ability to expand, and in severe enough cases, this can also cause a problem getting oxygen across the alveoli to the capillary, some sort of a diffusion impairment. This can be due to things like severe pneumonia, some really big bag medications, radiation therapy, diseases like sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the list goes on. With extra pulmonary restrictive lung disease, something outside of the lung is preventing the lung from expanding into the chest. So this could be fluid buildup, like a plural effusion fluid between the lung and the plora. It could be a big belly, pushing the diaphragm up into the chest like a sighties when patients have severe liver failure. It could also be a severe case of scoliosis. There's several causes of this as well. We dive deep into all of things respiratory in the Confident Care membership. The obstructive lung disease lecture is already up. I just finished recording restrictive lung disease today. In the meantime, let me know if this video was helpful to you. Drop your questions in the comments below.",subjective

Great question. Depends on the insurance. You've got managed care insurances like United Health Care, Blue Crossbow Shield, Humana, all the big ones. They cover aid services under home health, which is a intermittent, skilled, short-term type of care. And usually it's not eight hours a day for aid services. On the other hand, if you have long-term care insurance, which are the major carriers like Genworth, MetLife, and you're paying long-term care insurance, yeah, they usually do cover that and you can just kind of basically reach out to them and say, okay, I need XYZ, I need X amount of hours, and you can get that covered.

The truth of it has never been reported. This is the Department of Health and Human Services, and on March 16, 2020, they were going to full remote work. Network operators had to adjust all their firewall and security settings to allow hundreds of thousands of new, unknown connections into their network so they had to scale down their security all at the same time. And that's when the attack struck. We had tested the system, we had made investments to prepare for this moment, and all of the sudden, all of the additional capabilities that we put in place so that they could easily work from home. All that additional bandwidth is now being consumed. We were extremely confused as to what was actually happening. Our Reheta and his team initially thought it was what is known as a distributed denial of service or DDoS attack. We started to actually move the internet traffic across the HHS network and something very abnormal happened. The actor, the adversary actually started following us as we moved the internet traffic. No matter what they did, the attacker adapted, but it never took the network down entirely. It always stopped just short of the full capacity. And that got them questioning then if this isn't an attempt to take down the network, what is it about? And what they landed on was this was a scanning operation. This was an attempt, a successful attempt to map the entirety of the Health and Human Services network in very, very quick fashions. I believe that the only two countries in the world that could probably launch something at that scale with that level of planning and coordination are Russia or China. This was like a nuclear weapon in the sense that a distributed denial of service attack that at the scale that we appeared to be experiencing would have ended our ability to function and operate.

Over 78,000 people were surveyed and they found that black, Hispanic, and Asian people reported higher rates of food allergies compared to white people. There were some notable differences in terms of the types of foods that people were allergic to. As an example, Asian children reported the highest rates of tree-nut allergies and black children had reported the highest rates of egg allergy and fish allergy. Also, black individuals were more likely to report having multiple food allergies compared to other groups. Now, approximately 200,000 people go to the emergency room each year in the United States due to a food allergic reaction and of those, the highest rates were amongst black and Hispanic individuals. Lastly, people living in lower income brackets were least likely to report having an epinephrine auto-injector device, which is a life-saving medication to treat severe allergic reactions, and there were more likely to report having visited the ER for a food allergic reaction compared to those in wealthier income brackets. What the study tells us is that there is clearly a health care disparity amongst people of color and those living in lower income brackets compared to white people and those living in wealthier income brackets when it comes to food allergies. It does not answer why that's the case, but it's probably a mixture of environmental and socioeconomic factors. Clearly, we need systemic changes that help address these disparities so that people have access to healthy, allergy-friendly foods, as well as making epinephrine auto-injector devices much more affordable for the general population.",subjective

If this were family feud and I said, give me your top answer, you'd probably say cough and I go ding ding ding number one answer. But also think about stuffy nose, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, scratchy throat, certainly go along with respiratory infection. But now let's get into some other more serious types of symptoms. What about breathing difficulty? What does that look like? When I think of breathing difficulty, I think of rapid breathing that can be a sign of struggling with your breathing. Sometimes using extra muscles, those are called retractions. And sometimes if you're not getting enough oxygen in, you can have a pale or even bluish color to the skin. While all those symptoms that I just reviewed could because by things other than a respiratory infection, fevers definitely make us think a lot more of infection and that can be from a virus or a bacteria. If respiratory symptoms come from things like allergies or an irritant in the airway, they definitely aren't going to cause fever and they typically aren't going to cause overall headaches, body aches, feeling lousy, feeling really tired. Maybe a little some in there, but for the most part, when you start getting a complex of all those symptoms, particularly with the fever, think infection. And the way respiratory infections typically work is that you have a virus that comes in through your respiratory track. Nose sometimes through the mouth, down into the upper airways or eventually getting down into the lower airways. Those infections typically result in inflammation, which creates things like mucus and a lot of the symptoms that we just discussed. And when we talk about breathing fast, well, what's fast? Well, it's age-related. And as you can see, infants breathe a lot faster than adults. And so you can see on this chart, or the chart up above, that an infant can breathe 30 to 60 times per minute normally. And when we get down to closer to adolescent to adult, you're down to 12 to 16 breaths per minute. So if you see an infant breathing really fast, that might be 70 times a minute or 60 to 80 times a minute or even more. That's fast. But an adolescent or an adult who's breathing more than 20 times a minute, if that's related to an infection, that could be serious as well. Any medical concerns, if you have a question, you want to talk to your primary care doc. And if you think there's real distress going on, you want to get more emergent care.",subjective

One was at Marcus Garvey Academy, and the other was at Focus Hope Center for Children, and it turned out that they had two separate illnesses circulating. At Focus Hope Center for Children, there were at least 17 cases of hand foot and mouth disease, and one three-year-old girl who went up in the hospital for two days, that school had shut down last week for cleaning to help stop transmission of that virus. Marcus Garvey Academy also shut down last week for cleaning and to help stop transmission. There are up to 25 students there that got sick with flu-like symptoms, and unfortunately, one six-year-old passed away. The cause of death is not determined at this time. At least three students, though, contracted a bacterial illness called Hameothalus influenza, which there is a subtype of that that we do have in routine childhood vaccinations. Marcus Garvey Academy reopened on Monday, May 8th, with temperature checks at the door, and they strongly encourage mask use, but there was no mandate present at that school. The medical director of the Detroit Health Department last Friday had recommended preventive treatment for families that made a bit of contact with those who have Hameothalus influenza, the most likely medication they would use is something called refampin. Hopefully, don't hear of more kids getting sick in this area, but if you have any other questions, let me know and be well.",subjective

Welcome to a day in my life as an emergency management specialist in New York City. I commute to the city from Connecticut, which may sound like a lot, but one of the many benefits of working for this region in particular is its Mass Transit Reimbursement Program. My day starts at Union Station in New Haven, where I board an express train to Grand Central Terminal. Upon arriving at GCT, I catch a downtown 5 or 6 train and hop off three stops later at the Fulton Street Station. On beautiful summer days, I can walk a few blocks to reach one World Trade Center. And on crummy winter days, it all connects underground through the Oculus. One World Trade is the tallest building in the United States. You never really get used to the Florida ceiling glass windows that offer the most incredible views of the Big Apple. Every day is different when you work in emergency management. I love a job like this because you never know what's going to happen next. As a full-time FEMA employee, my time is split between typical office tasks and field deployment. I've traveled as far as Puerto Rico and as nearby as New Jersey. During Blue Skies or Study State, we spend our time strengthening relationships with internal and external partners, training, and planning and preparing for the next incident. So that when disaster strikes, we are ready to respond and aid the Impracted Community through their recovery process. Even with all of that going on, we always find time for coffee and good food throughout the financial district, Battery Park City, and Tribeca. One World Trade even has a sky-loving with an awesome cafe for those days you don't feel like venturing out too far. As another day winds down, I prepare to make the same commute from this morning in reverse. I stopped for a moment to take in the incredible architecture of Grand Central Terminal before boarding a Connecticut Bound train. This commute might be long, but it's the perfect opportunity to get lost in a good book or catch up on my favorite TV shows. Thanks for spending the day with me!",subjective

I submitted it in May April The process was pretty tough guys like I wanted to put in a bunch of pre-liminular evidence Which is pretty much like evidence showing that you're on the right track to answer the questions that you want to answer But my experiments weren't really working out like I wanted and at some point I was driving myself crazy working full-time and Grant writing full-time so that's the first lesson that I learned that I personally work best when I have like at least two weeks to write full-time no lab hours just reading and writing because doing both is so draining especially in that time I was not very emotionally stable. This was a huge project It was like a 65 page document and included a bunch of administrative information like the equipment all need budgets How many animals all need for testing? Justifying those needs then the me for this document is a six-page project proposal and a five-page document Detailing my previous research experiences and a very detailed training plan which says like what's my time to graduate? What skills will I need to work to progress through a postdoc and eventually attend your track position? And I'll say it was really interesting thinking about what I want to study five ten years on the line So anyway days before my submission in April my advisor and I sat down and pretty much read every single document of this 60-page grant word for word agreed on it and submitted I Celebrated for weeks because submitting this was like the hardest thing I think I've ever done Later I got scored which is awesome, but my score was very borderline and I was pretty upset about that But then I reached out to some mentors of mine and they told me first of all 10% of applications get scored So the rest get done up front so I should be happy also most of the grants that get funded are funded upon Re-submission not even the first admission So I sucked it up wait for the final decision wish was a no I was disappointed But then so I wasn't to be up about it because it doesn't mean that I'm not competent or deserving It's a numbers game and my grant did have some flaws that need correcting by the way I learned to be very careful about typos It was kind of embarrassing but the reviewers caught each and every single one of my typos Okay, I'm resubmitting in like two weeks.

Pre-owned diseases have got to be like one of the most sinister, horrifying things in nature. And the worst part is they could be living inside of you right now and you would have no idea. Pre-owned diseases are so under-researched that they are being misdiagnosed. Supposedly there's only 300 cases of pre-owned diseases in the US per year. However, somehow I have taken care of two confirmed cases of them in my five-year careers in Earth. And a third that was suspected but never confirmed. Pre-owned are a protein chain. They are not a virus. They are not a bacteria. They are not even technically alive. But somehow they are able to cause fatal, incurable disease in human beings. In humans, these diseases take a couple of different forms and they look very different. Once you are have the active form of the disease, there is nothing we can do to stop it from killing you. We also have a pretty good guess but no definite idea how these diseases spread. There are three main types. Spiratic, which means random, just kind of happened. We have no idea what caused it. Inherited, which means yes, you inherited it genetically, which is like fatal insomnia. It's thought to be inherited. It is basically a pre-owned disease that causes you to just never sleep again and then you die. And then acquired, which is things like mad cow disease, which happens from eating infected meat, whether it's cow or game. A lot of game meat has pre-owned in it. So even if you are hunting your meat, you need to send it in to be tested. Things like wasting disease in the deer population right now, that's a pre-owned disease. And if you eat that meat, it's theorized that that can then give you basically CJD or mad cow, which are both pre-owned diseases and both fatal 100% of the fucking time. Now, one thing we need to talk about with pre-owned diseases is that Trump, the Trump administration made it so that meat companies in the United States no longer have to test for pre-owneds in their meat. And the Biden administration has not overruled that. I have never seen a more miserable death. When I took care of a mad cow patient, the first mad cow patient I had, that patient we thought was unaware of what was going on. They couldn't move at all. Didn't respond to any commands, didn't follow any commands. But when we were talking to their family member about the prognosis, that man started crying. He had tears coming from his eyes. He was completely immobile, but had tears falling out of his eyeballs. At that moment, fucking changed me and I have never eaten red meat since. So yeah, in case you needed a new thing to obsess and freak out over, it's pre-owned. Oh yeah, and the worst part, they can live dormant in your body for like 20 fucking years. And you would never know.",subjective

I'm thinking about it. And just for background, I have a master's in public health, specifically in community health and global health. Prior to when I first started my master's program, I was actually in the epidemiology department, big forestry, and over to community health. And I can do a video on why I switch if anyone's interested. But to answer that question, honestly and truly, if you are like on the fence of Onni, I will say no. And here are the reasons why I'm saying no. Because a lot of the times when people ask me this question, it's like they don't know like if they want to do it, or like what they would do, what they want to do, or have their concentration in. And I say that the degree of public health is, honestly, there's so many things. You can be a woman's and a reductive health public health degree, master's in degree holder. You can be an epidemiology nutrition by statistics, community health, global health, international health. There's so many things, honestly, you can be a behavioral, like it literally depends on the school you go to and what you want to do. And as someone who knew that I thought I wanted to do something first and got there and realized, oh no, I don't. And then I switched. I can tell you first of all, like it took me an extra semester with the money because it would help me if I figured out what I really wanted to do before I started. And if you're on the fence on it, no. And also like in today's economy and climate, you don't want to go to school, thousands of dollars in debt for something you're not even sure if you want to do. Like you should be 100% sure that you're going to do it or not. You know what I mean. And also the job market right now is tough. It's really tough. So you want to make sure you're very competitive. If you don't have work experience, you're, you know, fresh out of undergrad, no work experience and you're just jumping to getting the masters, you are still going to be considered an early career specialist person because you don't have work experience. You don't have years of work experience. I found out the hard way. And in today's economy, think about this. You graduate a master's degree thinking you're going to make extra money and they'd be like, no, actually you're here with like maybe the bachelor's and one year of experience because of the master's counts of like a year, maybe two years of experience. That is like you have all that debt. And I'm just like, no, don't do it. If you are not sure if you don't have a plan and honestly, to be very marketable, you need work experience. You need years of work experience. And it's really unfortunate, especially in like in our field and like our space. But that is the reality. And as someone who has been under recruiting and of things, I've learned, I recruited a couple of people recently in my last job. I was also on the recruiting part of things mainly the interview panel. And I have done offers and stuff like that. But it's very heartbreaking. Like sometimes I would have to like put my foot down like people who are overqualified are applying for jobs that are way less because of wayoffs. So you want to make yourself competitive. And if you're not sure, I'm going to say no because you don't want to put yourself in debt. And that's just based off my experience and people around me that I've you know gone through this program with me. And like also if I know what I know now, I would have done a combined program, maybe an MPH MBA. So I can do more consulting roles and make myself more marketable. So that's just like my thought process. However, if you 100% know like I want to be an epidemiologist, I want to be a biostatition. And you're like, yes, this is what I want to do. Go for it because you have a plan. You know, you have the places. If you have the places you want to work out like I did. I had a place that I wanted to work at. I literally had a whole plan. Do it. But don't go to public health. Like get your medicine, public health and be a thousand dollars in that. And no shade, no, no shade. You're a woman's going to be productive health. Um, concentration. Cause are you an aging and public health? Because let's be so serious. You could have done a public, maybe policy or like management or even at B and done a concentration in aging or done a concentration movement every productive health. I was I switched to community health, which is honestly a big risk. Honestly, it's a big risk. I don't recommend. Epi was a smarter career choice for me, but you know what? That's not even go there. It's a whole story. That's the way I switch. But my certificate was in global health. And I started a woman's inner productive health certificate. Did I finish? I don't know if I finished that certificate. I don't remember. But I started that because I wanted to have like women's health and all that stuff in my back pocket. But you can literally do a certificate and just take an extra class or two and have that specialty versus making now your entire degree program. Because let's be so serious. You've put yourself in a box. The job market, you need to be flexible. You need to be able to go here, here, here. The job market is not pretty. And if you are only women's health and aging or nutrition, I'm sorry. You're going to have a tough time. You want to be flexible. You want to be able to apply to anything and everything and not be unemployed. At least post grad and get your foot enduring. After you get your foot enduring, you know, you can move around. But that first job, that's what you need to do. One thing I will say is that I yes, I wasn't sure before I went into my program. However, I had to quickly realize because I realized like I'm like, you know, I don't want to be in debt. Like my tuition was paid for and fees, but I still took on loan for housing. And I'm like, you know, I don't, I don't have that in parents. You know what I'm saying? So I had to quickly, you know, figure it out. I did everything. Like I was at every job, every, I did every apply for every internship network. I was friends with a lot of professors. I was able to know about new opportunities and new programs. And I had to make sure that I was networking. Okay. And if that's you 100% yes. But if you don't have all that energy to do all that work, honestly, you might want to think about it a little bit. But if you are not trying to be in a corporate space, ignore this video. If you are not trying to be in corporate space, you want to be more in like the nonprofit spaces video is not for you because honestly, the nonprofit space is always going to be hiring. But this is more just corporate that I'm talking about in terms of like for-profit companies because the job market for for-for-profit companies are very tough. But yeah.",subjective

And of course, everybody wants to know which company to go with, which health insurance is the best. And so the problem is out of all of these insurance companies, there are hundreds of policies with each company. Some are good, some are bad. So it's not as straightforward as just saying this one's the best or this one's the best because they all have good policies within each company and they all have really predatory scammy ones too. They all do it. What I will say in general is that the worst policies are the ones with the really high deductibles and out of pocket expenses. So if you have a high deductible and out of pocket expense, you may run into all of these issues where they're denying or requiring excessive paperwork from your doctor. And in that same respect, all of these companies have really good policies. So how do you figure this out? Well, you go to your employer. Yeah, your employer actually chooses your policy for you. Most people's employer. Some people purchase their own policies or they have state Medicaid or Medicare.

I've not really shared a lot of my experience with child-on-child sexual abuse because I personally carry a lot of shame because I was the perpetrator in some instances as well as the victim in some instances. So yes, I experienced child-on-child sexual abuse. My brothers would touch me inappropriately and I would touch them inappropriately. But when it comes to this form of child-on-child sexual abuse, it looks extremely covert. That's why I keep getting comments like it's just a hug. You're a snowflake. People overreact. You're diminishing real sexual abuse. And it's like what those people are purposely not listening to is the fact that I had a history of child sexual abuse already, which is why my mother forced my brother to hug me that way. No one is saying that the hug itself was sexual abuse. Although I do just want to point out that whether you're a child or an adult, anytime you touch somebody knowing that they do not want you to, or you force somebody else to touch somebody knowing that they do not want you to, or you are touched without your consent, that is abuse. It does not matter what your family relation is or how close you are to a person. If somebody touches you without your consent and knowing that you feel violated, they have abused you. Is it sexual abuse when siblings hug each other? No, it's not. Is it sexual abuse when two siblings choose to hug? Absolutely not. And nobody is saying that it is. Is it sexual abuse when two siblings do not want to hug, but the mother forces one of the siblings to hug her and bury his face in her chest simply because the mother knows that her daughter has been sexually abused by her husband and it makes her daughter feel violated and uncomfortable and would make for a better photo to post on Facebook for all of the friends to see and humiliate the children over. That is sexual abuse. That is child on child sexual abuse. When it comes to child on child sexual abuse, we need to remember that both children are always the victim. I think what's really riling people up when I'm calling this child on child sexual abuse is because they're assuming that I'm saying my brother is outfault or I'm holding my brother to some degree of accountability in this situation when I'm not at all. He was just as much of a victim. He equally did not want to hug me. He equally did not want to bury his face in his sister's chest. The reason our abuse went on for so long and nobody helped us was because people chalked it up to this. They're just naughty kids, being naughty, mom made them hug it out, what is the big deal? When what's really going on is both children have been stripped of their bodily autonomy and now they are being publicly humiliated for doing something that was completely developmentally normal.",subjective

So if you are like I was and you don't know shit about insurance I'm gonna give you the basics. Number one, premium. That is the amount of money you pay per month just to have insurance. Now you may be thinking oh I'm gonna pay this amount per month and then insurance is going to pay all my bills. No all this does is allow you to carry that little insurance card in your wallet. Next up deductible. That is the amount of extra money the insurance company wants you to pay before they'll start covering your services. So in this example if you're paying $500 a month for insurance and you go to the ER and get a $2,000 bill the insurance company wants you to pay at least $1,000 before they'll start covering your services. Copay so that is a set amount of money that your insurance want you to pay for certain services such as $30 for a visit to your primary care. Coinsurance means that your insurance wants you to pay a percentage of that service. So let's do another example. If you got an extra for $2,000 you're going to have to first pay a $1,000 to meet your deductible and then you're gonna owe 20% of the remaining $1,000. So total you'll pay $1,200. Last out of pocket maximum that is the maximum amount of money that you yourself can pay for medical services throughout a calendar year. So your insurance says once you hit this big ass number and you've paid $10,000 out of your own pocket or whatever the number is they'll pay for the rest. Now there are thousands of ways that insurance companies can configure these things but those are the very very basic terms of our crappy insurance system.",subjective

Well, the answer is always actually pretty surprising to people. So Medicare is based on income, all right? So what Medicare is going to do if you're finally from Medicare in 2023, they're going to look at your tax return from 2021. So most people don't realize this. If you are in the base rate of Medicare and I'm going to put the charts on here so you can see what they are, the base rate is $164.90. The top tier is over $500 a month per person for Medicare. People are shocked by that. So look at the tier, look at the income structure. That's what you're going to pay. It correlates to your modified adjusted growth income from two years prior. Now Medicare is going to keep rolling and keep going forward and looking back two years. So it might adjust, it might fluctuate, but the kicker is people are surprised. I talked to a retiring attorney this year and he's shocked. He said you've got to be kidding. It's going to be costing me $800 a month for my Medicare. And that's per person per month. And I said yes. And again, it's based on income. So not everybody's in that category. 70% of you are in the base rate, but the higher income earners are very surprised about this.

If you didn't already know, people with female biology are 1.7 times more likely to experience adverse side effects and medications because the clinical trials used to determine the proper dosage are male-dominated trials. Most clinical trials are male-dominated, due to a number of factors that we'll talk about in a minute. But because traditionally, these clinical trials are male-dominated, pharmaceutical companies have little motivation to remedy the situation and change it. And when they do include female participants, their adverse side effects in these trials increase, which doesn't look good on the pharmaceutical company, and it doesn't look good on the drug that they're trying to study. So instead, they would rather limit female participation or just not let us participate at all. This comment just says that birth defects are the reasons that female participants are excluded. But that's not the entire story. Sure, female participants can get pregnant, and that leads to financial and legal liability for the pharmaceutical company. But this can be addressed in a variety of ways, like requiring the participants to be on birth control and putting in place legal protections for the pharmaceutical company and the participants. Aside from the risks of getting pregnant, though, female participants also have more complicated hormonal fluctuations, differing metabolisms from the male participants, and social barriers, like childcare responsibilities, which can limit your ability to attend different doctors' appointments or do all the things you need to do to attend and participate in a clinical trial. This is just an example with an interview with a researcher who is doing a Phase I clinical trial, which Phase I trials are the ones that determine safe and proper dosages. In a trial where they allowed female participants, there were a lot more adverse effects than expected. The pharma company wanted them to rerun the trial, but this time they just excluded female participants. The adverse profile was much better, which was more with the pharmaceutical company was looking for. And excluding women, not only are they potentially saving themselves from liability of a woman should get pregnant, but they're also making their drugs appear safer and more tolerable than they really are. And because childcare responsibilities cause logistical barriers, a lot of times clinical researchers would just avoid enrolling mothers altogether. To make matters worse, women are underrepresented on the boards that organize and plan these clinical trials. So when it comes to logistical barriers like childcare responsibilities, men just don't consider these things. So they don't even consider the options to accommodate participants to overcome these barriers. Instead, they just decide that we shouldn't participate at all because we're more biologically and socially complicated. Although it's really not that complicated, we just live in a man's world and we know that if men had more complex biology and more unpaid labor that they had to account for, they would account for it. But that's not the world we live in. It can be done though, because when clinical trials are done on women and women plan the clinical trials, they do things like offer valley parking and babysitting. Who would have thought? So yeah, kind of funny how people just want to boil it down to birth defects. When in reality, it's a much more complex discussion that many people just don't want to have.",subjective

And on Monday, the US Department of Health and Human Services released a letter to the nation's teaching hospitals, essentially compelling them to obtain informed consent from medical students performing sensitive examinations. So I think now is a good time to talk about this. The fact that such a letter was even necessary is incredibly telling and incredibly disturbing. It is my opinion that medical students should not be performing pelvic exams on anyone besides standardized patients. For those of you who did not go to medical school, standardized patients are people in the community, usually actors, who sign up with the medical school to teach medical students how to perform various skills or provide care in various clinical scenarios. These individuals can either opt in or opt out of teaching sensitive examinations and are compensated for their time. So it's not that I'm saying medical students shouldn't learn how to perform pelvic exams. I'm saying we should learn how to do them inappropriate and ethical scenarios. My main concern is that I don't know if it is truly possible to obtain consent for a medical student to perform a superfluous, unnecessary pelvic exam in the operating room. In my experience, that consent was obtained in pre-op by a member of the surgical team before they rolled back to the operating room. So think about the position the patients are in. They are waiting to be rolled back to the OR. They are getting surgery. They're scared. They might be having some sort of gynecologic cancer, recacted, or they might be having a big operation like a hysterectomy. And the person who comes in is either their surgeon or a resident who works with the attending surgeon who's going to be doing their surgery. And they ask them, essentially for a favor, you cannot tell me that 100% of the time, if someone feels uncomfortable with a medical student performing a pelvic exam on them. They're going to say no. They are going to be people who feel coerced or compelled to say yes just to keep their surgeon happy. And they're still going to be uncomfortable about it. And that's unacceptable. Especially when we have a viable alternative. And then for those medical students who go on to be OBGYNs, they will perform hundreds, thousands of pelvic exams as part of necessary clinical care throughout their residency training. So it's not like people who need to perform pelvic exams on a regular basis aren't getting the training they need. I do not feel like the educational benefit of medical students performing pelvic exams outweighs the risk to public health, to trust in the field of OBGYN, which is already in trouble in this country. It's just not worth it.

I have a lot of things I want to say about all the things that are going on but I want to address this one first. FEMA is only relocating people using their TSA lodging to Oahu and Hawaii, the big island. Otherwise they're saying deal with Red Cross, deal with Red Cross, which one of the same these entities, right? But regardless, if you'd like to stay in Maui, you have to talk to the Red Cross who has been not helpful. I know I spoke to somebody directly who is a member of the Red Cross who was down there, boots on the ground and I do think he was trying his best. And so I'm not talking about the individuals but the entity has a whole shady, shady, shady, shady. That's where the email. So they're saying that they're eligible for FEMA's TSA lodging in Oahu or Hawaii counties or to participate in the state's lodging program in Maui, which is managed by the Red Cross talk to them. And then here's a list of participating hotels. These people have been displaced from their homes. Their land is very, very valuable if they own their land. And there are people who are land grabbing trying to steal right from underneath them. And then FEMA wants to just move them to the other island. Well, this stuff goes on. They don't even want to take responsibility for assisting people in their own home island. Now I think personally I'm going to, I have some theories but I do think it's an attempt to get Kanaka away from their Ina to attempt whatever. I really do. I really do think that. And regardless, they're not, this email is ridiculous and not very helpful at all. These people lost everything. Their homes, some of them, their livelihoods, some of them, their spouses, their children, their elders, people lost everything, their community. And these are the emails they're getting. Very confusing. If you want to stay here, deal with the Red Cross who has been notoriously in health for the whole time. And if you want to not, you know, be homeless on the street like many Kanaka end up being after disasters or the tourism industry, increasing the cost of living, transplants, increasing the cost of living, colonization, then go to the other island. Get out of our way. Now I have a theory as well as that this might be because of people on the other side of the island saying that they need tourism. And I said people shouldn't be disaster tourists and I stand by that. I think there's other ways to assist local businesses and business people than going there and taking the resources. And some people are saying that there are resources, the grocery stores are stocked and all these things. But regardless, just like this is saying right here, every island needs to help because again, as I said in my first video, unfortunately, Hawaii is a state, legally and extra not. And we only have the resources that are allocated to us. So everybody, all hands on deck type of situation. Regardless of all of this, I still encourage you guys to go to my link on my bio here, my link on my bio on Instagram and donate to directly to the family so that they can actually have control of this, avoid donating to cash grab, Oprah Winfrey, who doesn't even want to put her own money where her mouth is.

So if the drugs found way more than a certain amount, we call it drug trafficking. For most drug trafficking cases, we attorneys are going to be looking closely at three things. First, the police search that revealed the drugs was that legal. Second, everything leading up to find in the drugs, the confidential informants, the wiretaps, was any of that legal a lot of times this not. But the most important and overlooked aspect of a trafficking case is the chemistry by far. We will be hiring an expert chemist. Chemistry is very important on a trafficking case. Look, we all know the state chemists can prove what the substance is. This was fentanyl. But it's not easy to prove exactly how much fentanyl is there in, say, a thousand pills. That's a whole different scientific analysis. Now, aside from the chemistry, I'd say the main problem with drug trafficking cases are these minimum mandatory prison sentences where the judge has no leeway on these and that they're on every single trafficking case. So what we call the min man depends on the weight of the drug. The more drugs you have, the higher the minimum mandatory prison sentence goes. That being said, I mean, we defense attorneys have ways around this. We have all sorts of options. I don't want you to lose hope here, but I do want you to get a local attorney involved.

I like to call this the foundation of Medicare. It's hospital part A and medical part B. Part A is gonna cost most seniors $0 a month because you worked 40 quarters or 10 years. Part B on the other hand is gonna cost most seniors $164 in 90 cents a month this year in 2023, depending on your income. Those two together, part A and part B are what they call original Medicare, which covers you at 80% of anything that you get done, leaving you with 20%. Medicare has two options on how to make that 20% more affordable. Your first option is Medicare Advantage. Typically with Medicare Advantage plans, you can expect to have a premium of $0 per month. They don't cost anything to have, but you have co-pays when you get things done. So like if you get a surgery done, it may be $200, or if you see a specialist, it may be $35, but you get the point you pay as you go. With Medicare Advantage, they also have certain doctor and hospital networks that you have to stay within or risk not being covered. With Medicare Advantage, they also have drug coverage built in at no extra cost. So you don't have to get a separate drug plan to cover your medications. It comes built in for free. Medicare Advantage also has built in extra benefits for free. So dental coverage, hearing coverage, vision coverage, it's all built in for free at no extra cost. Your second option in covering that 20% is called Medicare Supplement. If you take out a Medicare Supplement, you can typically expect to have a premium of $110 to $180 a month, depending on where you live. But you're not gonna have any copays like on Medicare Advantage. All you're gonna have is a one time a year, January through December, $226 deductible. So you know if you pay your premium and that $226 deductible, that you're gonna have 100% coverage no matter what. Medicare Supplement also doesn't have any doctor networks. So it's about 92% of all doctors and hospitals across the United States except Medicare Supplement. So you don't have to worry about being in network. Medicare Supplement also doesn't have any drug coverage built in. You have to go out and get what they call a separate prescription drug plan to cover your medications, which typically is about a 10 to $15 more per month. With Medicare Supplement, they also don't have any extra benefits. So no dental coverage, hearing coverage, vision coverage. You have to go out and get a separate dental vision and hearing plan to have those services covered.

Does the NIH have any role in drug pricing? No, not that I know of, frankly. What NIH does is fund awards to the extramural community, academic institutions, and nonprofit companies, and in certain cases industry to conduct biomedical research. And those awards are governed under something called the Bidol Act, which means that NIH is assigning the ability to license and the intellectual property to our grantees. What NIH does have is an intramural program that is the only place where NIH might be able to introduce clauses in those licensing agreements that could address almost any kind of access including eventually pricing. My interpretation here was that regardless of the merits on drug pricing, which is a big issue for our entire system, it was a bit of a non-sequitor to hold up an NIH director position on those grounds. Is that fair? Oh, I don't know. I think anything that the NIH has a role in is fair game when a confirmation hearing is occurring. And drug pricing and access to therapies, many of which come funded at some level from NIH funding. I think it's a fair to question whether the American people are getting a fair return on their investment from Parma and other industry outlets for the research that the federal government pays for.

Let me explain. I'm a board certified pediatrician and I have five of my own kids. My job is to help protect and care for your child. And I like my job. I like helping you raise healthy, happy kids. But when it comes to vaccines, I don't know. All of a sudden people don't trust me anymore. Question mark, do you think that I don't have the same access you do to internet sources that say vaccines are harmful or bad or dangerous or will grow horns on your child or whatever? Believe me, I've seen it and I've read it. But I also have access to medical literature and studies done by actual PhDs who are a lot smarter than I am. And some of the comments will say, bro, you're only influenced by big pharma. And I love that one. When your kid is sick and you come to me and I recommend honey and a humidifier and saltwater gargles, is that lining the pockets of big pharma? Oh, but Dr. Williams, you're getting paid to push vaccines on children. Do you know what my biggest monthly expense is? It's maintaining all of my vaccines. They're expensive. It makes no financial difference to my paycheck, whether your child is vaccinated or not. All medical interventions have risks. Vaccines have risk. If your child gets sick and needs an antibiotic, there's risks there too. In fact, I've seen way more adverse reactions to antibiotics than I ever have to vaccine. The bottom line is that I actually really care about your child. I want what's best for them. I want to see them grow up healthy and happy. All five of my kids are fully vaccinated and on time. And I would never suggest something for your child that I wouldn't do for my own. And you can trust whatever blog posts or TikTok videos you want. But your pediatrician has spent their entire career, studying reliable resources, trying to do what's best for your child. So make sure you're following TikTok KidDoc if you're interested in evidence-based tips to help you raise healthy and thriving children.",subjective

Previously, I had mentioned ASPR Chief of Staff Brian, showing emailing at Dr. Robert Johnson at Bardab regarding using chloroquine as a therapeutic. Well, on this day last year, he followed up on that, reportedly demanding it, and that they'd, like, immediately. But wait, there's more! Joseph Hamill, ASPR is a strategic innovation and tech manager emailed the number of Bardab officials, including Christopher Houchens. It was about a promising compound for COVID treatment, chloroquine. Bayer had offered three million doses of chloroquine to the strategic national stockpile, and they wanted Houchens to take a look to make sure it was legit. Hamill ended the email with this could be a big immediate win. But it wasn't. Houchens then emails Rick Brecht with his team's review of the Safety of Layers medication.

This is my most asked question I'm going to share you my journey to how I got here. I work as an administrative assistant but technically I carry two roles as an admin and a project specialist. I work in health equity and health disparities so products that I do revolve around our community engagement or data projects. But my main focus right now is creating health equity trainings. Also disclaimer, I have a bachelor's degree in psychology. I don't have a master's in public health and this is my first job out of college. In college I was taking a lot of course requirements to go to medical school because at the time I wanted to be a doctor. So a lot of my extracurriculars were revolved around health, specifically mental health. Trigger warning, so skip to the timestamp if you want to. I joined a research lab that studied the genetics of suicide and other stress related conditions. I also did a certificate in infant mental health where I did an internship working with children who have experienced severe trauma and I did my capstone project on that. I also did non-health related activities. I was a student leader for my colleges, Asian student organization that had a focus on social justice. Started my own student org and volunteered at food banks and AEPI focused on profits. All of those experiences and skills learned along with my own personal why made me a well-rounded candidate. Social justice is so intertwined in public health and we also value lived experiences. Those experiences were not required for the admin position but I had a hard time getting a job. The job hunt sucked. I was applying a job for four months before I finally got two offers. I did ask my manager to be involved in projects which is why I have two rules. Does my compensation reflect that? No, as I make a little over $23, which is on the higher end for an admin role in my area but not for doing two rules. If you want to work in public health for the money, this is the wrong field. I also want to say that public health is so politicized now, especially health equity, that the work can be challenging, but the results can be so rewarding. Good luck to you if you're on the job hunt and you just need one job to get your foot in the door.",subjective

I talk about therapy and rehab a lot. Yes. Based on what happened to me, it happens to a lot of young men, young women, and we hold on to it as we get older. Being molested, being touched, being raped, being bullied, being forgotten about, being discarded as children, being given up for adoption, being put into the foster care system. I don't know if you all know that except being put up for adoption. Therapy is crucial and important. A lot of black men, men are all over the world, but a lot of black men have taught to not cry, cry in this for little girls. Don't be a punk man up. Don't fall in love, don't hold hands, don't hug. I went through all of that. The things that happened to me as a child started five years old and then seven years old, I was watching porn, then eight years old, I lost my virginity. And then between the eights of 10 and 12, I had an uncle that was touching me. And so that's what I knew, being abused, being neglected. My parents had known me of this, you know? And I was wetting the bed from ages five to probably 12 or 13. I found out why I was wetting the bed when I was 47 years old when I started my therapy, is because I was abused and neglected. But black men are taught to suck it up, man up. And what does that mean? We never get an answer. We just told the suck up a man up, but it doesn't do us any good. Then we go into our relationships, being mean, being honored, being disrespectful, being this this this this, this, this, this, this, Ronald, you know, being unhappy, being rude, you know, cheating, lying, deceiving, all of narcissistic things. And we started doing that as a child, you know, the ghosting, the gaslighting, the silent treatment, it starts when you're a child, a young man, a young lady. And so a lot of us don't ever go into therapy. I should have gone to therapy at five years old. Now, here's the thing with therapy. And I talked about therapy and rehab rehab is not related to drugs when I'm talking about therapy. Women and men go into therapy and then guess what? You go back home after therapy, whether it's an hour, a day, two hours a week, and you go back home to where you live with that person that puts you in therapy. And so you have no rehab rehab is being around people that love you, being around people that care for you, being around people that uplift you, being around people that want to see be successful, being around people that want to get you away from the person that has you in therapy. That's the rehab. So for me, narcissism, personality type of people talk therapy is what helped me out. I think psychotherapists and psychologists, psychologists, people that can do talk therapy and or diagnose narcissistic people. So go in therapy, stay in it and when you come out, get your rehab, being around people that want to help you grow and help you stay alive. Great question. Thank you for that.",subjective

The other like tracks in an MPH degree are usually like epidemiology, which is the study of how diseases spread, biostatistics, health management policy, nutrition sciences, and environmental sciences, and of course going to a public health school is the most common way to get into public health, but once I started working in the field, I realized a lot of the people I was working with got into it in some other way. I work in an office of community health at a health system, and a lot of the people that do similar work as I do have masters of public policy, masters of service administration, masters of health administration. A lot of public health is non-profit, so you could go like a more non-profit management route to get into public health. Unfortunately, a lot of public health is not funded by the government, it is funded by individuals and foundations. So a lot of people work in like philanthropy or development, but they work to fund public health projects. Getting a job at a charitable foundation that funds public health, like you could get into that with a communications degree or like a non-profit management degree, a lot of different things other than just an MPH. I think if you come from more of a general communications, or even like a journalism background, you could end up working in public health because these organizations that do public health need people to communicate their messages, and it's not always just done by people with MPHs. Back to my point about this work being grant funded a lot, a lot of these public health organizations hire dedicated grant writers, so if you have a writing background, if you have an English degree, but you want to use that to do public health work, you could probably get like a grant writing position with that. I know a lot of social workers that end up working in public health, so my point is just for public health specifically, there's so many ways to arrive at a career in public health. I think it's really helpful to get a little bit of work experience before you decide on a grad school path because there's really so many ways you can go.",subjective

I'm starting the south with yet another strong image. As you can see on the ground, there's probably hundreds of syringes right here and all this is about a block away from one of the larger open-air drug markets in Baltimore City. After people purchase drug, they'll typically go to these spots to use them and it ends up being like a collection pool of use syringes more or less. Another thing we're seeing is that people are cutting the fentanyl with necrotizing agents like xylazine, possibly even crocodile and it really leaves people in a state of active addiction with very very serious open wounds on their body, which can quickly lead to endocardiitis and infection of the heart, which requires an open heart surgery and can be very deadly. What's really sad is that people will be using these drugs as an escape from a bleak and harsh reality, but the use of these drugs actually end up causing the bleak harsh reality that people are trying to escape from in the first place, so it just becomes this vicious cycle. If you're trying to get involved, I have distributable resource cards specific to cities and states that you can hand off to people that are in active states of addiction or homelessness.

So one thing I would love to do is as a nurse and as someone who's worked in our healthcare system explain to people like the general public hopefully you watching this why it is literally the only way we will ever fix our healthcare system as it stands today. Out of all the first world developed developed countries on planet earth America is the only country that allows health insurance companies to be for profit legally. They are mandated by law to be not for profit in virtually every other country in the world. The reason for this is very very simple. It is unethical to pull a profit while providing health insurance. What it does is it creates a system where companies health insurance companies make money by causing people to die. That is the simplest way to put it. We are literally allowing them to capitalize death. I would also say that after the pandemic most of us can agree that having your health insurance tied to a job is downright asinine. We also all could probably agree that an MRI should not cost anyone in this country $10,000 a pop. A simple imaging test should not cost you $10,000. Lab work should not cost $7,000 and I literally know what does because I didn't have health insurance and got lab work done and that's what they charged me. But because big medicine and the health insurance companies are more or less in cahoots they know that they can pretty much charge whatever the fuck they want and the health insurance companies will fork it over. That's simply because there are too many health insurance brokers in order to negotiate prices with big medicine. When you have a single pair system, when you have a single entity, a single health insurance entity, a government run health insurance entity that negotiates prices with hospitals, with clinics. They can literally say no fuck you, you're not going to charge $10,000 for one goddamn image or $27,000 for a single cancer treatment. Do you get what I'm kind of putting down here? We have no fucking negotiating power. The average American household right now pays $10,000 every year for basic health coverage. If we switched that over to a payroll tax, not only are you going to be cutting your costs by half for the average American, we also would have enough money left over to give every single person who loses their job because of this $200 a month for two years. Medicare for all is the only way.",subjective

So if there were a cure for cancer, this would actually save the government so much money because they could reduce the amount of money they spend on cancer research every single year. Not only that, but if there were a cure, the government wouldn't even benefit from it directly. Some big pharma company would probably patten the drug and make all the money off.

Anywho, I want to talk a little bit about pay and pay ranges and how folks get paid in the medical device industry and what that looks like. So typically we make a base salary of your W2 employee, you make commission and then we also have the opportunity to earn bonuses based on hitting your target. So for me I get a new target every six months and based on that target depends on how I do towards the target. So like I start getting paid commission when I hit 50% of my target. Some companies at 60, 80 or you even have to hit a hundred before you start making any commission. So on top of my commission I also have a base salary because I'm a W2 employee. Base salaries for medical device are pretty good. I would say the average medical device rap makes between 150 and 300 thousand dollars a year. It really depends on the company you work for. The type of product that you're selling, are you selling a capital device, are selling a disposable product, are you selling a buy and build product, are you selling something that goes through DME and it's built directly to the patient's insurance. There are so many factors that play into this and so it really just depends. Now medical device folks typically make more than pharmaceutical reps as a whole. Pharmaceutical reps sometimes have higher base salaries. I've seen here lately anything between a hundred and 120 thousand plus commission. I'd say your average pharmaceutical rep probably makes like 160, maybe 180, really depends. But for medical device I would say it is a pretty well-paying job. They're hard to get into. You really have to know someone to get your foot in the door or start as an associate account manager and work your way in like that for the most part. But it is a great, great compensation. I also get a car stipend so that goes into my pay every month as well. So we're paid while. Let me know if you have any questions.",subjective

During this time I picked up on a couple of tricks to help keep the child calm. First off as a health care provider you want to enter the room like it's no big deal. You want to give the impression that the child you're not worried about anything and that they shouldn't be either. Next try and strike out a conversation about something they're interested in. Usually they wear something on their t-shirt that they're interested in. He saw them playing with an iPad or a phone and asked what games they play. He's trying to get a live conversation going to take their focus off the needle. He can also offer a reward for when the child's done like a lollipop. I also wanted to trick from a nurse, tell the child to wiggle their fingers and it won't hurt as much. It's actually true because it has a distractionary effect. These needles are very small and they're recated to the amount of pain that patient actually experiences and provide many times by the mind. Also this is a little extra about the woman in this video is wearing bright red scrubs. It's actually been proven that different colors can actually have different effects on people. Where lighter colors like blue can be very calming. Bright red can actually cause stress and anxiety. Fortunately in this case the health care provider was able to vaccinate the patient successfully. However when it comes to a patient won't stand still you're always worried about needle sticks or misdoses. Fortunately in the parent in this case was able to restrain and calm the patient long enough for them to get their shots.",subjective

In order to do adequate CPR where you are getting good blood flow throughout the body and you're not compromising tissue perfusion, which just means that the blood is really getting into pretty much all the tissues, you have to press down on someone's chest pretty hard.

Not only that you should be going about 100 beats a minute, which is pretty fast. And if you're not doing adequate CPR, you might not be doing a good job at bringing them back to life. Now the purpose of this device right here, the Lucas device is to help with chest compressions. And as you can see, it's doing a great job without getting tired. Not only does this help with CPR fatigue, it can also help free up hands, which is very important during a cold bloat. You see during a cold bloat, everyone has a job to do. This someone who's doing chest compressions, they're someone who is managing the time. They're someone who's giving the doctor the meds. The doctor is watching and making sure everything is going well. They may have to intubate the patient. They may have to like put a line inside the patient and order to give them certain medications that can be given to a peripheral line. So needless to say, it's a very hectic time. Someone has a job to do and sometimes people are doing two or three jobs at the same time because there's not enough people in the room or in the department to help out at that moment. And you can imagine how confusing or taxing can be for someone to have to do chest compressions then go back to the job that they were doing and then go back to doing chest compressions. And that's where the Lucas device is phenomenal. It takes away that extra burden that help your providers feel when they're doing a coat or when they're doing chest compressions because they also know that there are other things they can be doing to help bring this patient back to life. Now, is it important to know how to do adequate chest compressions? Yes, of course. I have never seen the Lucas device work in action in person at my hospital and in the hospitals I've worked at and rotated and studied that. We always did manual chest compressions because it's always good to know how to do the job with your hands first or foremost before you rely on a machine that might not be there when you need it. Regardless of all that, this device is still freaking cool.",subjective

So no, this does not say that the PCR that's being used since February is faulty or having false positives or being recalled. It simply states that they're not continuing with the SARS-only PCR tests from the CDC. Instead, they recommend that you use one of the texts both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, so a combination of the two PCRs in a single test. And nowhere in this article does it say that the SARS-CoV-2 PCR cannot tell the difference between flu and SARS-CoV-2. You can see below me here with the upcoming flu season, they think it's more reasonable to use a combination test instead of running two separate tests. That's why they're discontinuing this test. So COVID is real and the PCR is the best test to detect the presence of the virus. I hope this helps.",subjective

There's a lot more. A great example is dealing with pandemics. Great example is my boy Dr. John Snow. So during Victorian England there's a huge color outbreak and like 10,000 people died. He did, he's made a map around London and each time there was an outbreak he put a little dot right there. He then noticed that they were circling around a certain sewer area, yes. Once they fixed those sewer pipes, the color outbreaks went down drastically. A great example is in 2014 with Ebola. So Liberia's maps were super outdated. Geographers got to work on the road maps, the cultural regions, and they made extremely high-tech maps. When there is an outbreak, doctors will prepare it on what to do. You click on one of these buttons and show to you the culture of that region, how to prepare for that, as well as how the medical facilities are being handled. So by the time the doctors and the epidemiologists got there, they were prepared to go whether they had to go with culture or how to deal with medical facilities.

So we will be subject if they can make this work to vaccines developed in a hundred days, which the organization SEPI is planning to do. And one of the people who founded SEPI was Jeremy Farah who is now the chief scientist at the WHO to bring this forward. Other things that the amendments do is to bind the states so they have no longer recommendations but enforceable edits. Provide a liability shield, get rid of intellectual property rights, move supplies from one country to another, enforce digital passports, and the director general of who can demand that a pandemic or a potential pandemic exists. He can just declare it with no standards and then countries around the world will have to obey. Also the who will tell you what drugs you can and can't use in your nation once a pandemic is declared.

One health is a concept that was created to enable the WHO with these documents to take over jurisdiction of everything in the world by saying that climate change, animals, plants, water systems, ecosystems are all central to health.

The chances of long-term complications from vaccines are extremely unlikely because of how they work. Most of their job is done in the first few days, then the vaccine is gone from your body. What's left is the immune response to that vaccine. 2. mRNA vaccines have the potential to be even safer. Most vaccines use inactivated or dead viruses. This new technique avoids all of that. 3. Long-term complications are rarely rare. Happens one in several million. You have a higher chance of being struck by lightning, which happens to be 1 in 700,000. 4. Generally, most side effects show up within two months of immunization, so anything severe would have shown up in the COVID trial participants. 5. Think about the risk of no vaccine, i.e. getting the disease or infection. If you get COVID, the risk of long-term complications like heart and lung problems, chronic fatigue are far greater.",subjective

It is hard because what you learn from university is all about staying in labs, doing experiments and how to best culture this bacteria so it doesn't die in this condition.

And also, you are pretty much restricted by the experience you have, which is mostly again in the lab. Bring that down that, didn't like that experience, and let me tell you all the options that you can consider. Let's start from the scientific roles that you can consider. The first thing that you can do is obviously research a system without getting a PhD degree or going down in the root of committing three to four years of your life to a PhD or postdoc. This allows you to do a bit more research, takes some time to find a balance between lab work or any other type of work. And usually this is with research institution or universities. And the second role that you can consider is going to be more commercially based is R&D pharmaceutical or biotech companies. You're going to be still doing some lab work, doing some research, but it wouldn't be so theoretical. For a meeting, you're going to discover new mechanism, you know, finding out new theories and discoveries. Instead, you are going to focus on optimizing drug and finding out what's the best way to make sure, you know, our body can absorb certain type of liquid or drugs, which is actually going to be more fascinating than just trying to figure out if, you know, how certain things work. And it will bring you more fulfillment because you are actually contributing to the development of a drug. These are more scientific roles that you can consider because it does tap into your pre-16 knowledge and skills such that you have developed. But in general, in the industry, there are lots of other roles that you can consider if you have biology or biomedical sciences degree. In the next video, I'm going to explain more of the commercial roles that you can take and make sure you follow for more.",subjective

Upper eyelid lifts can be covered but lower eyelid lifts in general are not. So here's some of the steps you need to go through to see if your insurance will cover your eyelid lift. The first thing you want to do is call your insurance company and see if this is a covered benefit. Rarely, it's not under any circumstance and it's always a good idea to know this in advance before scheduling appointments. So, in general, the most important thing that you need is physician notes that document that your vision is obstructed in a way that affects the activities of daily living, such as driving. So, physicians like myself that do blepharoplasty, we know the things to write in a note that they want to hear. So, we will ask you all the right questions and that will already be in your note but that's very important that everything is documented properly. Included in these physician notes are a good physical exam and often photos of the droopy eyelids. So, we always document how close the eyelid is to the pupil and if you have toses or drooping of your eyelids, sometimes that will also help you get your blepharoplasty covered. Now, sometimes your physician's notes are not enough and you will actually be required to go have what's called a visual field test. So, you will be sent to another location, some doctors actually have it in their location, especially if they're ocular plastic surgeons, and they will do testing on you that will demonstrate that you have objective problems with vision out to the sides. And so, some insurers require that. I've had a few that have not in the past and notes were enough but usually in my experience, they require that. There are a few other rare things that can sometimes get a blepharoplasty covered, sometimes severe thyroid disease, being born with toses, so a young person can occasionally get a blepharoplasty covered, or even sometimes the lids low enough to irritate the lash line and cause infections but not low enough to obstruct your vision. Sometimes that can even get covered but in general, most people it's peripheral visual field obstruction. So, blepharoplasty is just an amazing procedure, not only can it functionally improve your life and improve your vision, but just cosmetically it's awesome too. I had one in December and I have a day by day recovery if you want to see my crazy swollen face over a week after my upper blepharoplasty. I have a playlist on my page.",subjective

So like when we look at this attachment inside of this packet, let's look at the Texas administrative code that you all put in place. Let's look at that. And that will be Title 40, Part 19, Chapter 745, Sub Chapter M, B. If you do not waive your right to request an administrative review, we may not implement any decision or action that is the subject of the review until you do process rights concerning the decision or actions are exalted. Right? So this is why we got the issue with height monitoring y'all. This is why we have the issue with providers being on probation. Minority providers that look like me are either facing ramification or either with those excessive fees because guess what? They are breaking this law that y'all put in place. How can you put any provider on any type of action or any type of remedy if the admin review are incomplete? So I'm going to give you a prime example. My agency, they put my agency on height monitoring. Not height monitoring. Yeah, they did. They put it on height monitoring at first and then when I turn around and show them that it was some forged documents on my compliance history, then they take me off of height monitoring. Now you want to put me on probation. So how can you put me on probation? And I have several administrative reviews that are not even completed. So clearly you have a mockery of the laws of our lawmakers. I got a problem with that. And let's look at the proof because I'm not just talking. I have the proof in the documents for you. When you look at this page here and you see the writing that's on the side, those and its four pages. Those are all the admin reviews that are incomplete yet you're putting my agency on probation. How is that possible? How is it that my agency was assessed for over $20,000 and we still had incomplete admin reviews? You break into Texas administrative code to grease your pockets and close minority small women owned businesses. Got a problem with that. Let's go to the next page real quick. I brought out the facts. Let's go to the page where it deals with close to the end where it shows with the compliance history. If you go to the page where it talks about it has the person by the name of Rachel Blanks at the top. It looks like this. Right. So let's take a look at that. That was done in 2018. And it says your operation has done a very good job. Compliant with minimum standards. You're and yourself has worked hard and it's very evident. Congratulations on a good job and keep up the good work. Turn to that compliance history on that next page. Now do you see that those that one deficiency that's at the bottom that circle. And you see where it says medium correct. Okay. So let's look at that same investigation. And let's fast forward to 2020. This was sent in on December. I mean on October 27 2020 and because I requested the compliance history. I have my compliance history from the first time I opened and it's supposed to match correct. So let's look at that one. Same investigation. It's too high deficiencies that was forged there. Now keep in mind I just want to give you a sample. I have the whole compliance history and it's more than just that. So this data that's been forged. How many other providers have been forged? How many other providers are unjustly on height monitoring? How many other providers are unjustly on probation? How many other providers are unjustly had they business closed because of another Texas penal code that was violated. 30, 17, falsification and documentation of a governmental record. Accountability need to be had here. Then when you look at the next page after I brought it to their attention. It's still there. Interesting isn't it? And that's the very last page. It's still there. So you telling me you put me and other minority providers on probation on height monitoring everything else and we cannot even trust for you to have the correct compliance history because you are tampering with it. And let me tell you how I know that that's happening everyone because every year the department gives providers their compliance history so you can see how you're doing. Right? I had my answers. I opened in 2010. So it's supposed to match. So if I showed you 2018, I just gave you that little sprinkle. It's supposed to match for 2020. And they took off the medium deficiency and added to how many patients this. Somebody need to go jail.",subjective

If you needed some sort of rehab or skilled nursing and you needed it in a skilled nursing facility under Medicare, the only way they're on the hook for paying for that is if you have had a three-day consecutive inpatient stay at a hospital. So if you went to a hospital and the first day you're in the emergency room or the first day you're there and you're under observation instead of being checked in as inpatient, those days don't count towards the three consecutive days. Now you may think I'm being dramatic by saying this is the most important rule but think about it when you're in a situation and you have a loved one that's injured. We just had somebody in my family very seriously injured and you know of course my concern is let's get the best care let's get them to the hospital etc but in the back of my mind because I knew this rule I knew that he had to have a three-day consecutive inpatient stay in order to be able to have Medicare on the hook to cover the skilled nursing facility care that he's going to need after the hospital stay. The first day there he was in the emergency room and it wasn't until the second day that he was checked in as inpatient and I want to read this rule to you up above so you remember it because while you're trying to do good for your family member this is also going to be part of protecting them. So let's look at this language up above so you know what you have to think about in this situation. So in order to have a qualifying stay at the hospital you have to have three consecutive days or more starting with the day the hospital admits you as inpatient not including the day you leave the hospital. The time you spent at the hospital under observation so they haven't checked you as inpatient or in the emergency room before you're admitted does not count towards the three-day qualifying inpatient hospital stay even if you're there overnight. So remember this rule because it could make a huge difference in the future if you are trying to help a loved one or yourself when you have some sort of an emergency or you need skill care.",subjective

Now there are some studies that are funded by Pharma, but we don't just take the results and go with what they say. We look at other things like the Jupiter trial. We figured out that CRB actually increased the marker for high inflammation and stands reduce it. We figured out that people not on a stand if they have a high CRB or if they have a normal LDL, it actually is worse for them. We figured out a lot of things that wasn't what AstraZeneca was trying to prove, but you got to be very careful when you analyze studies and who they paid for. So I agree with this. You got to be very careful of who funds the study and who does it, and you got to get your own takeaways from it and not just go by what the authors concluded or what the manufacturers concluded.

Yesterday I presented the case of an 18-year-old girl who presented to the ER with just a few hours of confusion and high fevers. She had fevers up to 103 degrees and her roommates brought her in because she wasn't acting quite right. Upon arrival, she was confused and complained of a headache and nausea. I mentioned that when we examined her in the emergency room, she had a heart rate of 120, a fever to 103 degrees and had this rash all over her body. She also had a positive brusinski sign as well as a kernic sign. These are two common tests we use when we're concerned that someone has meningitis. Kernic sign is when you flex a knee to 90 degrees and then you extend the leg and that can induce pain. And brusinski sign is where you passively flex the neck when the patient's legs are straight and they will instinctively pull their legs up due to pain. These are both positive and meningitis because these two maneuvers will stretch the meninges which are the covering of the brain and spine and cause these reflexes. The meninges are the covering of the brain and the spine and they can become infected just like any other part of our body but when they become infected it can become life threatening. Here are the symptoms of meningitis and our patient had almost all of these headaches, altered mental status, photophobia meaning that the light bothers your eyes, neck pain or stiffness, extremely high fevers and it can even cause this type of rash. It's important to remember that not all meningitis patients will develop a rash but you can test for it by using what's called the glass test. If you press on the rash with the glass cup it will not blanch meaning it won't go away. A person with this type of rash is septic and they are extremely sick and need urgent attention. How do you get it? It's spread by personal contact with someone that has the bacteria such as coughing or people that live together like dorm rooms. Some people even naturally have this bacteria in their nasopharynx and we really don't know why some people get really sick from this bacteria and some people don't but we do know the vaccination helps prevent contracting and spreading the bacteria. That's why you get this vaccine before you go to college. Okay doctor back to this patient because she's really sick right now. It is so important to recognize all of these symptoms because literally someone can die in just a few hours from this bacteria. If you even suspect it you best start treating it immediately because that can save a life. Ideally to make the diagnosis we do a lumbar puncture to check the spinal fluid for signs of infection. If that looks concerning or clinically you have a suspicion this patient needs a third generation sephalus for an antibiotic lycrosephan. This patient got a lumbar puncture and got immediate antibiotic treatment and she lived to tell the tale. If her roommates did not pick up on this and bring her to the hospital she could have died. And like I said earlier the mortality rate is 15 to 20 percent and in survivors one in five of them will have a permanent disability from their infection that can be hearing loss brain damage kidney damage or even limb amputations due to the sepsis. This particular patient have the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis with niaciria meningitis. It's a type of bacteria that can cause this meningitis. And remember this is not just isolated to adolescents and teenagers. This disease can happen in small babies under one year old all the way through any age on this spectrum. The best way to prevent meningitis is to get vaccinated which will protect you from five different strains of bacteria that can cause meningitis. Here are the CDC's latest recommendations for the meningococcel vaccine. Our patient had immediate diagnosis due to the astute nature of her roommates knowing that something was wrong and the emergency room provider who promptly gave her antibiotics and she survived without any deficits. The antibiotic should be administered to anybody that had close contact with that person within seven days of her symptom onset and that's typically given by a drug called refampin. Another case of patient focused and compassionate care. Stay tuned next week and I'll go through another case.",subjective

My name is Dinn, I am so glad that you made this video because it just goes to show just like I've been saying all along that people who are suspicious of all the things are just trying to do the best thing for their baby. And you know what you are? A good mom. And I'm here to tell you that it is okay to be scared about all this stuff. You wanna know what? Cause I'm not scared, and I'm here to help you. The first thing that I tell people about being on the internet is to never believe anything that anyone says on the internet. So you already have step one down is that being suspicious part. The next step is to make sure that we are not consuming opinions that we are consuming evidence because anybody can say anything on these wild interwebs. Even me. The next step in finding like credible stuff is to look at their credentials of the person who's talking about it. I don't want you to believe me, but here are mine. The next thing you need to know is that the internet remembers what you search for. And we'll give you content that matches up with that. So I heard you say that you hear also people on the internet saying like it's bad to get whatever. If you are on a journey to enlightenment about the things that you hear or see on the internet and wanting to find out if it's true, one thing you can do is to go into TikTok or your other apps and clear your cash. This is basically the information that it's stored about you that it uses to manipulate you by giving you content that it thinks you're gonna like. Next, when you're looking for information, you're going to search neutral terms. So you're not gonna search, why is it good to give blah, blah, blah? And you're not gonna search, why is it bad to get blah, blah, blah? You say risks and benefits of blank. And when you're searching it, you're gonna go to something that's not just Google. We're gonna go to Google Scholar. This is where you're gonna find peer-reviewed evidence. So remember how you said, I wish I could just talk to a scientist. This is how we do it. And the peer-reviewed part, make sure that their evidence is good. So peer-reviewed evidence is when other scientists look at it, they're not their buddies, they're just looking at it to say, is this evidence in the way that they got it reliable? But on Google Scholar, you're gonna type in neutral terms. So let's say you just type in vitamin K. It's gonna show you things. You're gonna filter it by the year. You want it to be fairly recent. For our purposes, we'll say the last 10 years. That's probably too long, but last 10 years. I don't want you to get caught in the weeds of all it's gonna say, because there's a lot. Scroll all the way down the bottom to the conclusion. Read that and talk to your trusted healthcare provider. I promise we're not getting paid off to tell you this stuff.",subjective

All the money you and your parents earned during your lives could be taken by the government to pay for medical care. I'm gonna tell you how you can avoid that. You have to understand that if you and your parents need long-term care, nursing home care, down the road, you either have to pay for that out of your pocket with long-term care insurance or with Medicaid benefits. To get Medicaid, you basically have to make yourself poor. Here's how to avoid doing that. The strategy you want is to put as much of what you have as possible into an asset protection trust. Once it's been in there for five years, it's protected from Medicaid. Strategy two is to put your assets into an annuity or a promissory note that is Medicaid compliant. Strategy three is a caregiver or a personal care agreement or a friend or a family member can provide care to you that Medicaid would not normally provide. Strategy four, if there's a spouse still living at home, transferring assets to that spouse. Medicaid may still want some of that money in the long run, but there's a better chance of preserving it. It will pay to get professional legal help to find out what your state allows on all of these.",subjective

Harry had Hegeman from the State of Wyoming. When I'm home traveling in Wyoming and hearing from constituents at my various town halls, I'm consistently asked why we would fund any organization that is clearly succumbed to the well of the CCP. In Wyoming, we don't believe in entering into agreements with foreign entities that would force Americans to give up our sovereignty. It is worth noting that the bulk of the WHO's budget comes from voluntary contributions donated by various countries and organizations. Throughout the past decade, the United States has donated billions of taxpayer dollars making us the WHO's largest financial contributor. However, the actions and decisions taken by the WHO have provided no reason to continue funding their operations. As we know, the Chinese Communist Party has gained significant influence over the WHO's decisions. Indisputable evidence shows that the COVID-19 originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Despite numerous contradictions to the natural origin theory and no evidence supporting pre-epidemic infections, the WHO has continued to unequivocally support the claims made by the CCP that the virus originated in a wet market. The reality is that international law does not trump our Constitution. Biden cannot force Americans to follow laws and regulations not passed by our own federal government. And we will not tolerate and stand for this America last agenda. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Tim Barton. Tim Barton. Barton, you're a great guy. Thank you. I go to the radio. I just need to go to the radio. Tim Barton, second congressional district, Tennessee. Malphus has gotten dozens of calls from concerned DCNC and is concerned about what effect this so-called pandemic treaty would have held on their freedoms. The World Health Organization has no right to tell hard work in Americans what the heck they do and with any kind of health care that they need to have. We are even funding the World Health Organization. Why the heck are we even funded them in the first place? The United States is their largest contributor. Since 2010, we've given over $3.5 billion. That's with the B. That doesn't mean a lot here, but I'll tell you what. And East Tennessee, it means a whole heck of a lot. The World Health Organization pandemic treaty is very vague. It affects our sovereignty. And it could be exploited to tell Americans what kind of health care that they need in the event of a global pandemic. My priority has always been protecting Americans' freedom to choose their own health care. And it also protects American companies that are investing in health care. The Biden administration, honestly, I don't think they could pour water out of a boot if the instructions were written on the dead gum heel. They don't care about our interests and they don't share them. Here in the COVID-19 pandemic, the Biden administration wanted to give away important intellectual property related to US companies' vaccine research. Last year, I introduced a bill to protect Americans' intellectual property from being wrongfully seized and handed over to the Communist Chinese Party. And I'll introduce that bill again this year. Thank you all very much for the opportunity to be here. Thank you all for being quiet over there. Thank you. Dr. Brian Babin. Thank you. Thank you. Well, first of all, I just want to say thank you to Ralph Norman, our friend and colleague from South Carolina. And to Frank Gaffney, thank you so much for this important endeavor. I'm Brian Babin. I represent the 36 Congressional District from Great State of Texas. And in case it still needs to be said, the Chinese Communist Party is on a quest to supplant America as the world's number one superpower. And because of Joe Biden's weakness and aptitude and inability to lead the CCP, unfortunately, is succeeding. For instance, hundreds of Americans will die today from Chinese fentanyl being pumped through our open southern borders. The CCP is buying up our farmland, pushing propaganda on our universities, stealing our technology, and spying on Americans through apps like TikTok. Biden is allowing the CCP's influence at every single turn. The World Health Organization is absolutely a prime example. Trump took us out. Biden has put us back in. And for what benefit? China runs it. If we continue to bow to globalist organizations who don't act in the interest of our own country, we will continue to be hurt, look no further than to who, and how they handle COVID, the lockdowns, the repression, the lack of transparency and truth. The last thing we need is to be put under the heel of the World Health Organization and lose our sovereignty. We cannot afford to surrender not another inch of our independence, an autonomy to Beijing or to those who do its bidding. And so China, remember, is no longer our friend and really never was. And it's time that we started acting like that. Thank you very much, and I yield back. Thank you, Brian. Andy Biggs. Thank you very much. Andy Biggs, Arizona's fifth congressional district. Thank you for Ralph Norman for organizing this and Frank Gaffney for working as well. You know, the House Foreign Affairs Committee actually issued a report on CCP and its relationship with the World Health Organization with regard to COVID. Let's see what they said. They said it's beyond doubt the CCP actively engaged in a cover-up designed to obfuscate data, hide relevant public health information, and suppress doctors and journals who attempted to warn the world. They deliberately and repeatedly disregard the obligations under the 2005 treaty. What did the World Health Organization do? Well, this is what Director General Tedros did. He's sorry, responded to the CCP's cover-up by praising the CCP for their transparency. Despite internal documents showing who frustration with the CCP's failure to share critical data, and information about the virus, and they repeatedly, the who and Director General Tedros repeatedly parroted CCP talking points and ignored conflicting information from reputable sources. I'm just here to tell you, in the last bit, we've given $3.5 billion in aid to support the World Health Organization to what end? Underlining the United States' sovereignty and the health of the world, they're getting into the bed with the Chinese Communist Party. And guess what? Chinese Communist Party is no longer an economic competitor. They're a geopolitical adversary. Supporting the World Health Organization is detrimental to the United States. We should have nothing to do with them and this administration better not try to enter into a treaty with them, seating further sovereignty to this out of control multilateral institution. With that, I think, by the way, I sponsored a bill to do just that, so I hope you get out there. And now turn it over to Mr. Kevin Herndt. And I have another question.",subjective

Previously considered extremely premature, these infants now have a fighting chance at life due to advances in neonatal intensive care and medical technology. In recent years, improvements in respiratory support, such as surfactant therapy and advanced ventilator techniques, have played a vital role in helping the immature lungs of these babies function. Neonatal specialists have developed strategies to manage complications associated with prematurity, including respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, and infections. Advancements in nutrition and feeding techniques have also contributed to the improved outcomes for these infants. The development of specialized formulas and techniques for delivering nutrients intravenously or through feeding tubes has enhanced their growth and development. Additionally, the advent of sophisticated monitoring systems has allowed healthcare providers to closely monitor the vital signs and overall well-being of these fragile infants. Continuous monitoring and early intervention help identify and address potential complications promptly. #MedicalAdvances #PrematureBabies #NeonatalIntensiveCare #RespiratorySupport #SurfactantTherapy #VentilatorTechniques #PrematurityComplications #RespiratoryDistressSyndrome #IntraventricularHemorrhage #Infections #Nutrition #FeedingTechniques #MonitoringSystems #CollaborativeCare #SharedDecisionMaking #SurvivalRates #QualityofLife #PrematureInfants #MedicalTechnology #HealthcareAdvancements #doctor #medicine #interesting #interestingfacts #interestingvideos #interestingthings #healthcare #fypシ ",False,,drsermedmezher,DrSermedMezher,,,,,,False,Ventilators (Medical),2020,,,
