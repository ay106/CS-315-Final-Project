Because when I was growing up, that was such a huge deal. And if you're not at you, the biggest reasons that we do this are for the birth of a child, for when someone becomes a bar about Mitzvah, or even like to memorialize someone after they have passed. And besides, like how cool is it to have a literal tree planted in your name in the Jewish homeland? I mean, for a Jewish American kid, it's pretty freaking cool. And when I went to Israel on my eighth grade trip with my Jewish day school, they even took us to a spot where we got to physically place a tree sapling into the ground in our own honor. It was so cool. So a little bit of background tree planting is done through the Jewish National Fund or the JNF. It's a nonprofit that was founded in 1901 to buy and develop land in Palestine or at the time it was still Ottoman Syria. And since the JNF's creation, they have planted over 240 million trees in Israel. And it's been a commonly accepted way for Jews in the diaspora to build relationships with the land of Israel without physically living there. Amidstva, some might say. So whenever I heard the acronym JNF in the past, I had positive connotations. I didn't really think much about it until reading the ethnic cleansing of Palestine by Elon Pappay. Because early on in the book, he mentions JNF in the context of colonization. And immediately I was like, what? What's the tree people? Yep, the tree people. So later on, I was reading a part in the book about what happened to Palestinians after Israel declared independence in 1948. And here's where I like truly lost my mind. As we know, UN resolution wanted before called for the immediate repatriation of Palestinians, which Israel blatantly ignored. In the Arab Affairs Committee, which was created and run by Zionists, knew that they had to settle the Palestinian property strategically so that the whole world wouldn't turn against them. And one suggestion solution was, how about we sell it to the American Jews? According to international law, they couldn't sell the stolen land, so they had to come up with something else. So they suggested that perhaps that they could buy the land from the Arab that no longer wished to return. But that idea was struck down immediately by Joseph Whites, who was the head of the JNF at the time. You see, Whites had been very closely following Zionist colonization specifically of the rural areas of the land. And he worked really hard to make sure that as that land was colonized, all of it fell into JNF hands. So I'm quoting Whites word for word on what he suggested they do next. All we need is 400 tractors. Each tractor can cultivate 3,000 dunam, cultivating not just for the purpose of procuring food, but in order to prevent anyone returning to their lands. Land of lesser quality should be sold to private or public sectors. Members of the Arab Affairs Committee, who still had a little bit of humanity left, were opposed to this idea. And so they tried to find another solution. But before they could, Davi Bengorion got impatient. And so he decided to create a new committee of two to make the decision. And one of those two people was Joseph Whites. So of course, the decision they made focused on destruction and confiscation of the land. And it's insane to me because in Judaism, this is such a widely accepted form of gifting. And now that things have moved online, you can plant a tree in Israel for a multitude of reasons. Just at the click of a button. Check it out. Here's a pet certificate. And then we have the Coretta Scott King Forest certificate. And finally, we have the iTreeU certificate.

So I do not know if my synagogue fundraised and sent money to the IDF. I was not like I was not on the administrative side of things so I don't know if they were or not you know like I wasn't seeing the books I wasn't seeing the finances so they might have been sending money to the IDF I don't know but what I do know is that as a Hebrew school student they were having us donate money to the JNF to the Jewish National Fund and if you don't know what the JNF is you're not alone neither did we because they told us it was to plant trees in Israel right and they cover it as charity and so when you're Jewish charity or Sadaka is a very big deal it's a really big mitzvah and we are really really encouraged to give to other people it's very encouraged to do charity work it's very encouraged to just give whatever you can whenever you can you know and so that is something that we are taught very young and we are also taught that Jews really like trees we just we have a very deep connection with the land of Israel and the trees and stuff and so we're taught from a very young age that trees are great and we love trees right and so at least what we did at my synagogue is we would have this thing called we had Sadaka boxes and they were charity boxes and there would be a competition each year for how much each grade could raise for charity and sometimes it would go to a local charity they would give us like we would do choices right sometimes it would be and so some and we'd vote on it and so sometimes we would end up voting for like an animal shelter or like a local women's charity or a homeless shelter or something like that but because the JNF was so pushed by the synagogue and was everywhere like when you were younger you knew what the JNF was you would see it all like they had posters and maps and so you would see the logo everywhere and so you knew what the JNF was and people are like they plant trees they plant trees and you're like oh my god trees because you're four years old and you don't understand you're like I was I started kindergarten I started pre-k at my Hebrew school when I was four and I didn't know I never learned about the Palestinian conflict until I was like old enough to start being on the internet myself because I never learned it in secular school like history class because it's a very Eurocentric American-centric history that we learn in in secular school and then I never learned it in Hebrew school because we didn't want we didn't like talking about it we didn't talk about I did not know the Palestinian conflict was a thing okay and that is immense privilege and I know that but like I didn't even know what it was there was no way that I could push back against the propaganda that I was being force fed basically like I didn't how would I know it how do you know what you don't know until you're exposed to it and so once I started being on the internet more and being more exposed to it but it took years to break down the propaganda that I had been given steadily for 13 14 15 years so this is how we would do it so basically they have the charity box called the Sudaka box and the JNF has something called the Blue Box initiative so basically we would put our little money are and this was money I had saved from like birthdays holidays Hanukkah Christmas graduation good grade sometimes I would get like five dollars or whatever and so I'd I'd save up my money for Sudaka boxes because if you won that year if you raised the most money in charity for like the JNF that year you got like an ice cream party so I wanted to win that ice cream party and so I would save up my money to bring to stand at the Hebrew school for the JNF Sudaka box so as a kid you think you are giving to charity and your planting trees right all good things all great things what they don't tell you is they're using your money as a child to buy money buy money buy land out from under Palestinian people who are no longer there because they were forced out during the creation of state of Israel and even prior to the state of Israel they were still buying land out from under Palestinian landowners they are using your money to buy land to either have Israeli settlers come in and push out the existing communities or they're buying land and planting trees over what was once Palestinian towns villages houses and farms and fields so that's what they were spending our money on and they didn't tell us that I didn't learn that until fairly recently and if you just go on the JNF website it's incredibly insidious because now that I know what they're doing and now that I know what they're actually using my money for it's incredibly clear how they are covering and hiding what they're really doing to seem like they only care about developing and helping people and that is not what they're doing at all so this is part of their website and so this whole section this top section this is all about buying up land and displacing the existing communities and existing people and basically pushing a Bedouin development funny to me because they are actively pushing out the Bedouin communities as along with Palestinians so they're physically buying up the land with again children's charity money like I cannot stress enough how much they lied to us lying by a mission is still lying if I had known my money was going to kick people out of their homes or like to make sure that make it so that they can never come back to their homes I probably wouldn't have donated you know like if I had known actually what they're using your money for I probably would have donated to a animal shelter instead but they told us it was just and like even see how it down at the bottom it says plant trees in Israel that's what we were told as kids and so this whole first part the 400 million which is like the bulk of their stuff is to buy up land and develop communities and then import North American people and North American Jews for Aliyah which Aliyah just means you are from another country and you're moving to Israel now moving to another country is something that people do every day right so in that in and of itself is not bad what is bad is they are forcing out and by buying land they're forcing out other the existing communities in Israel and then they're importing Jews that they like or that think like them and so they're importing North American Jews to settle that land that used to belong to somebody else but they bought the land up right so it's like it's moving with the insidious undertone of displacing the local communities isn't it so fun isn't this so much fun so this is the second part it's called connecting the next generation this is their propaganda machine this is their if you'll see like Zionist programs and advocacy kindergarten through eighth grade so by the time I started to actually learn what Palestine was and the conflict and anything about the conflict I have been brainwashed since about pre-K since about kindergarten to think that Israel was this perfect oasis because they never told us anything differently was to think it was amazing and that anyone who said anything differently was being antisemitic because I'm Jewish and I know all about Israel and Israel is a really great place and you're just being antisemitic and so they're literally training us with all this money to basically train us to push back against any criticism of Israel for them so they don't have to do it themselves and then you'll see this is like international cooperation so like international propaganda all that good stuff positive Israel propaganda and this is the last part and this is so once they've they bought the land out from under the Palestinians they imported North Americans and they've propagandized to children to blindly support Israel this is now they're gonna develop that land that they stole and so this is kind of what they told us they were gonna do ignoring all of the stealing right so like this is the big part that they're like we plant trees in Israel but they're planned to get on land that they bought out from under Palestinians and so yeah so this is how the Israeli government works to acquire land for Israeli settlers it works through the JNF which is a charitable organization charitable so they don't get taxed they don't have to tell you where that money is going they're just like plant trees in Israel and then you're as a child accidentally supporting displaced Palestinians with charity money that you think is going to trees and it is not well it is but not in a good way so yeah if you ever want to know how did the is how did Israel get so much money to buy all of this Palestinian land and move Jews there it was by lying to children about where their charity money was going,subjective

Because when I was growing up, that was such a huge deal. And if you're not at you, the biggest reasons that we do this are for the birth of a child, for when someone becomes a bar about Mitzvah, or even like to memorialize someone after they have passed. And besides, like how cool is it to have a literal tree planted in your name in the Jewish homeland? I mean, for a Jewish American kid, it's pretty freaking cool. And when I went to Israel on my eighth grade trip with my Jewish day school, they even took us to a spot where we got to physically place a tree sapling into the ground in our own honor. It was so cool. So a little bit of background tree planting is done through the Jewish National Fund or the JNF. It's a nonprofit that was founded in 1901 to buy and develop land in Palestine or at the time it was still Ottoman Syria. And since the JNF's creation, they have planted over 240 million trees in Israel. And it's been a commonly accepted way for Jews in the diaspora to build relationships with the land of Israel without physically living there. Amidstva, some might say. So whenever I heard the acronym JNF in the past, I had positive connotations. I didn't really think much about it until reading the ethnic cleansing of Palestine by Elon Pappay. Because early on in the book, he mentions JNF in the context of colonization. And immediately I was like, what? What's the tree people? Yep, the tree people. So later on, I was reading a part in the book about what happened to Palestinians after Israel declared independence in 1948. And here's where I like truly lost my mind. As we know, UN resolution wanted before called for the immediate repatriation of Palestinians, which Israel blatantly ignored. In the Arab Affairs Committee, which was created and run by Zionists, knew that they had to settle the Palestinian property strategically so that the whole world wouldn't turn against them. And one suggestion solution was, how about we sell it to the American Jews? According to international law, they couldn't sell the stolen land, so they had to come up with something else. So they suggested that perhaps that they could buy the land from the Arab that no longer wished to return. But that idea was struck down immediately by Joseph Whites, who was the head of the JNF at the time. You see, Whites had been very closely following Zionist colonization specifically of the rural areas of the land. And he worked really hard to make sure that as that land was colonized, all of it fell into JNF hands. So I'm quoting Whites word for word on what he suggested they do next. All we need is 400 tractors. Each tractor can cultivate 3,000 dunam, cultivating not just for the purpose of procuring food, but in order to prevent anyone returning to their lands. Land of lesser quality should be sold to private or public sectors. Members of the Arab Affairs Committee, who still had a little bit of humanity left, were opposed to this idea. And so they tried to find another solution. But before they could, Davi Bengorion got impatient. And so he decided to create a new committee of two to make the decision. And one of those two people was Joseph Whites. So of course, the decision they made focused on destruction and confiscation of the land. And it's insane to me because in Judaism, this is such a widely accepted form of gifting. And now that things have moved online, you can plant a tree in Israel for a multitude of reasons. Just at the click of a button. Check it out. Here's a pet certificate. And then we have the Coretta Scott King Forest certificate. And finally, we have the iTreeU certificate. I'm not quite sure that they ate with that one.",subjective

So I do not know if my synagogue fundraised and sent money to the IDF. I was not like I was not on the administrative side of things so I don't know if they were or not you know like I wasn't seeing the books I wasn't seeing the finances so they might have been sending money to the IDF I don't know but what I do know is that as a Hebrew school student they were having us donate money to the JNF to the Jewish National Fund and if you don't know what the JNF is you're not alone neither did we because they told us it was to plant trees in Israel right and they cover it as charity and so when you're Jewish charity or Sadaka is a very big deal it's a really big mitzvah and we are really really encouraged to give to other people it's very encouraged to do charity work it's very encouraged to just give whatever you can whenever you can you know and so that is something that we are taught very young and we are also taught that Jews really like trees we just we have a very deep connection with the land of Israel and the trees and stuff and so we're taught from a very young age that trees are great and we love trees right and so at least what we did at my synagogue is we would have this thing called we had Sadaka boxes and they were charity boxes and there would be a competition each year for how much each grade could raise for charity and sometimes it would go to a local charity they would give us like we would do choices right sometimes it would be and so some and we'd vote on it and so sometimes we would end up voting for like an animal shelter or like a local women's charity or a homeless shelter or something like that but because the JNF was so pushed by the synagogue and was everywhere like when you were younger you knew what the JNF was you would see it all like they had posters and maps and so you would see the logo everywhere and so you knew what the JNF was and people are like they plant trees they plant trees and you're like oh my god trees because you're four years old and you don't understand you're like I was I started kindergarten I started pre-k at my Hebrew school when I was four and I didn't know I never learned about the Palestinian conflict until I was like old enough to start being on the internet myself because I never learned it in secular school like history class because it's a very Eurocentric American-centric history that we learn in in secular school and then I never learned it in Hebrew school because we didn't want we didn't like talking about it we didn't talk about I did not know the Palestinian conflict was a thing okay and that is immense privilege and I know that but like I didn't even know what it was there was no way that I could push back against the propaganda that I was being force fed basically like I didn't how would I know it how do you know what you don't know until you're exposed to it and so once I started being on the internet more and being more exposed to it but it took years to break down the propaganda that I had been given steadily for 13 14 15 years so this is how we would do it so basically they have the charity box called the Sudaka box and the JNF has something called the Blue Box initiative so basically we would put our little money are and this was money I had saved from like birthdays holidays Hanukkah Christmas graduation good grade sometimes I would get like five dollars or whatever and so I'd I'd save up my money for Sudaka boxes because if you won that year if you raised the most money in charity for like the JNF that year you got like an ice cream party so I wanted to win that ice cream party and so I would save up my money to bring to stand at the Hebrew school for the JNF Sudaka box so as a kid you think you are giving to charity and your planting trees right all good things all great things what they don't tell you is they're using your money as a child to buy money buy money buy land out from under Palestinian people who are no longer there because they were forced out during the creation of state of Israel and even prior to the state of Israel they were still buying land out from under Palestinian landowners they are using your money to buy land to either have Israeli settlers come in and push out the existing communities or they're buying land and planting trees over what was once Palestinian towns villages houses and farms and fields so that's what they were spending our money on and they didn't tell us that I didn't learn that until fairly recently and if you just go on the JNF website it's incredibly insidious because now that I know what they're doing and now that I know what they're actually using my money for it's incredibly clear how they are covering and hiding what they're really doing to seem like they only care about developing and helping people and that is not what they're doing at all so this is part of their website and so this whole section this top section this is all about buying up land and displacing the existing communities and existing people and basically pushing a Bedouin development funny to me because they are actively pushing out the Bedouin communities as along with Palestinians so they're physically buying up the land with again children's charity money like I cannot stress enough how much they lied to us lying by a mission is still lying if I had known my money was going to kick people out of their homes or like to make sure that make it so that they can never come back to their homes I probably wouldn't have donated you know like if I had known actually what they're using your money for I probably would have donated to a animal shelter instead but they told us it was just and like even see how it down at the bottom it says plant trees in Israel that's what we were told as kids and so this whole first part the 400 million which is like the bulk of their stuff is to buy up land and develop communities and then import North American people and North American Jews for Aliyah which Aliyah just means you are from another country and you're moving to Israel now moving to another country is something that people do every day right so in that in and of itself is not bad what is bad is they are forcing out and by buying land they're forcing out other the existing communities in Israel and then they're importing Jews that they like or that think like them and so they're importing North American Jews to settle that land that used to belong to somebody else but they bought the land up right so it's like it's moving with the insidious undertone of displacing the local communities isn't it so fun isn't this so much fun so this is the second part it's called connecting the next generation this is their propaganda machine this is their if you'll see like Zionist programs and advocacy kindergarten through eighth grade so by the time I started to actually learn what Palestine was and the conflict and anything about the conflict I have been brainwashed since about pre-K since about kindergarten to think that Israel was this perfect oasis because they never told us anything differently was to think it was amazing and that anyone who said anything differently was being antisemitic because I'm Jewish and I know all about Israel and Israel is a really great place and you're just being antisemitic and so they're literally training us with all this money to basically train us to push back against any criticism of Israel for them so they don't have to do it themselves and then you'll see this is like international cooperation so like international propaganda all that good stuff positive Israel propaganda and this is the last part and this is so once they've they bought the land out from under the Palestinians they imported North Americans and they've propagandized to children to blindly support Israel this is now they're gonna develop that land that they stole and so this is kind of what they told us they were gonna do ignoring all of the stealing right so like this is the big part that they're like we plant trees in Israel but they're planned to get on land that they bought out from under Palestinians and so yeah so this is how the Israeli government works to acquire land for Israeli settlers it works through the JNF which is a charitable organization charitable so they don't get taxed they don't have to tell you where that money is going they're just like plant trees in Israel and then you're as a child accidentally supporting displaced Palestinians with charity money that you think is going to trees and it is not well it is but not in a good way so yeah if you ever want to know how did the is how did Israel get so much money to buy all of this Palestinian land and move Jews there it was by lying to children about where their charity money was going,subjective

Because when I was growing up, that was such a huge deal. And if you're not at you, the biggest reasons that we do this are for the birth of a child, for when someone becomes a bar about Mitzvah, or even like to memorialize someone after they have passed. And besides, like how cool is it to have a literal tree planted in your name in the Jewish homeland? I mean, for a Jewish American kid, it's pretty freaking cool. And when I went to Israel on my eighth grade trip with my Jewish day school, they even took us to a spot where we got to physically place a tree sapling into the ground in our own honor. It was so cool. So a little bit of background tree planting is done through the Jewish National Fund or the JNF. It's a nonprofit that was founded in 1901 to buy and develop land in Palestine or at the time it was still Ottoman Syria. And since the JNF's creation, they have planted over 240 million trees in Israel. And it's been a commonly accepted way for Jews in the diaspora to build relationships with the land of Israel without physically living there. Amidstva, some might say. So whenever I heard the acronym JNF in the past, I had positive connotations. I didn't really think much about it until reading the ethnic cleansing of Palestine by Elon Pappay. Because early on in the book, he mentions JNF in the context of colonization. And immediately I was like, what? What's the tree people? Yep, the tree people. So later on, I was reading a part in the book about what happened to Palestinians after Israel declared independence in 1948. And here's where I like truly lost my mind. As we know, UN resolution wanted before called for the immediate repatriation of Palestinians, which Israel blatantly ignored. In the Arab Affairs Committee, which was created and run by Zionists, knew that they had to settle the Palestinian property strategically so that the whole world wouldn't turn against them. And one suggestion solution was, how about we sell it to the American Jews? According to international law, they couldn't sell the stolen land, so they had to come up with something else. So they suggested that perhaps that they could buy the land from the Arab that no longer wished to return. But that idea was struck down immediately by Joseph Whites, who was the head of the JNF at the time. You see, Whites had been very closely following Zionist colonization specifically of the rural areas of the land. And he worked really hard to make sure that as that land was colonized, all of it fell into JNF hands. So I'm quoting Whites word for word on what he suggested they do next. All we need is 400 tractors. Each tractor can cultivate 3,000 dunam, cultivating not just for the purpose of procuring food, but in order to prevent anyone returning to their lands. Land of lesser quality should be sold to private or public sectors. Members of the Arab Affairs Committee, who still had a little bit of humanity left, were opposed to this idea. And so they tried to find another solution. But before they could, Davi Bengorion got impatient. And so he decided to create a new committee of two to make the decision. And one of those two people was Joseph Whites. So of course, the decision they made focused on destruction and confiscation of the land. And it's insane to me because in Judaism, this is such a widely accepted form of gifting. And now that things have moved online, you can plant a tree in Israel for a multitude of reasons. Just at the click of a button. Check it out. Here's a pet certificate. And then we have the Coretta Scott King Forest certificate. And finally, we have the iTreeU certificate. I'm not quite sure that they ate with that one.",subjective

So I do not know if my synagogue fundraised and sent money to the IDF. I was not like I was not on the administrative side of things so I don't know if they were or not you know like I wasn't seeing the books I wasn't seeing the finances so they might have been sending money to the IDF I don't know but what I do know is that as a Hebrew school student they were having us donate money to the JNF to the Jewish National Fund and if you don't know what the JNF is you're not alone neither did we because they told us it was to plant trees in Israel right and they cover it as charity and so when you're Jewish charity or Sadaka is a very big deal it's a really big mitzvah and we are really really encouraged to give to other people it's very encouraged to do charity work it's very encouraged to just give whatever you can whenever you can you know and so that is something that we are taught very young and we are also taught that Jews really like trees we just we have a very deep connection with the land of Israel and the trees and stuff and so we're taught from a very young age that trees are great and we love trees right and so at least what we did at my synagogue is we would have this thing called we had Sadaka boxes and they were charity boxes and there would be a competition each year for how much each grade could raise for charity and sometimes it would go to a local charity they would give us like we would do choices right sometimes it would be and so some and we'd vote on it and so sometimes we would end up voting for like an animal shelter or like a local women's charity or a homeless shelter or something like that but because the JNF was so pushed by the synagogue and was everywhere like when you were younger you knew what the JNF was you would see it all like they had posters and maps and so you would see the logo everywhere and so you knew what the JNF was and people are like they plant trees they plant trees and you're like oh my god trees because you're four years old and you don't understand you're like I was I started kindergarten I started pre-k at my Hebrew school when I was four and I didn't know I never learned about the Palestinian conflict until I was like old enough to start being on the internet myself because I never learned it in secular school like history class because it's a very Eurocentric American-centric history that we learn in in secular school and then I never learned it in Hebrew school because we didn't want we didn't like talking about it we didn't talk about I did not know the Palestinian conflict was a thing okay and that is immense privilege and I know that but like I didn't even know what it was there was no way that I could push back against the propaganda that I was being force fed basically like I didn't how would I know it how do you know what you don't know until you're exposed to it and so once I started being on the internet more and being more exposed to it but it took years to break down the propaganda that I had been given steadily for 13 14 15 years so this is how we would do it so basically they have the charity box called the Sudaka box and the JNF has something called the Blue Box initiative so basically we would put our little money are and this was money I had saved from like birthdays holidays Hanukkah Christmas graduation good grade sometimes I would get like five dollars or whatever and so I'd I'd save up my money for Sudaka boxes because if you won that year if you raised the most money in charity for like the JNF that year you got like an ice cream party so I wanted to win that ice cream party and so I would save up my money to bring to stand at the Hebrew school for the JNF Sudaka box so as a kid you think you are giving to charity and your planting trees right all good things all great things what they don't tell you is they're using your money as a child to buy money buy money buy land out from under Palestinian people who are no longer there because they were forced out during the creation of state of Israel and even prior to the state of Israel they were still buying land out from under Palestinian landowners they are using your money to buy land to either have Israeli settlers come in and push out the existing communities or they're buying land and planting trees over what was once Palestinian towns villages houses and farms and fields so that's what they were spending our money on and they didn't tell us that I didn't learn that until fairly recently and if you just go on the JNF website it's incredibly insidious because now that I know what they're doing and now that I know what they're actually using my money for it's incredibly clear how they are covering and hiding what they're really doing to seem like they only care about developing and helping people and that is not what they're doing at all so this is part of their website and so this whole section this top section this is all about buying up land and displacing the existing communities and existing people and basically pushing a Bedouin development funny to me because they are actively pushing out the Bedouin communities as along with Palestinians so they're physically buying up the land with again children's charity money like I cannot stress enough how much they lied to us lying by a mission is still lying if I had known my money was going to kick people out of their homes or like to make sure that make it so that they can never come back to their homes I probably wouldn't have donated you know like if I had known actually what they're using your money for I probably would have donated to a animal shelter instead but they told us it was just and like even see how it down at the bottom it says plant trees in Israel that's what we were told as kids and so this whole first part the 400 million which is like the bulk of their stuff is to buy up land and develop communities and then import North American people and North American Jews for Aliyah which Aliyah just means you are from another country and you're moving to Israel now moving to another country is something that people do every day right so in that in and of itself is not bad what is bad is they are forcing out and by buying land they're forcing out other the existing communities in Israel and then they're importing Jews that they like or that think like them and so they're importing North American Jews to settle that land that used to belong to somebody else but they bought the land up right so it's like it's moving with the insidious undertone of displacing the local communities isn't it so fun isn't this so much fun so this is the second part it's called connecting the next generation this is their propaganda machine this is their if you'll see like Zionist programs and advocacy kindergarten through eighth grade so by the time I started to actually learn what Palestine was and the conflict and anything about the conflict I have been brainwashed since about pre-K since about kindergarten to think that Israel was this perfect oasis because they never told us anything differently was to think it was amazing and that anyone who said anything differently was being antisemitic because I'm Jewish and I know all about Israel and Israel is a really great place and you're just being antisemitic and so they're literally training us with all this money to basically train us to push back against any criticism of Israel for them so they don't have to do it themselves and then you'll see this is like international cooperation so like international propaganda all that good stuff positive Israel propaganda and this is the last part and this is so once they've they bought the land out from under the Palestinians they imported North Americans and they've propagandized to children to blindly support Israel this is now they're gonna develop that land that they stole and so this is kind of what they told us they were gonna do ignoring all of the stealing right so like this is the big part that they're like we plant trees in Israel but they're planned to get on land that they bought out from under Palestinians and so yeah so this is how the Israeli government works to acquire land for Israeli settlers it works through the JNF which is a charitable organization charitable so they don't get taxed they don't have to tell you where that money is going they're just like plant trees in Israel and then you're as a child accidentally supporting displaced Palestinians with charity money that you think is going to trees and it is not well it is but not in a good way so yeah if you ever want to know how did the is how did Israel get so much money to buy all of this Palestinian land and move Jews there it was by lying to children about where their charity money was going,subjective

Because when I was growing up, that was such a huge deal. And if you're not at you, the biggest reasons that we do this are for the birth of a child, for when someone becomes a bar about Mitzvah, or even like to memorialize someone after they have passed. And besides, like how cool is it to have a literal tree planted in your name in the Jewish homeland? I mean, for a Jewish American kid, it's pretty freaking cool. And when I went to Israel on my eighth grade trip with my Jewish day school, they even took us to a spot where we got to physically place a tree sapling into the ground in our own honor. It was so cool. So a little bit of background tree planting is done through the Jewish National Fund or the JNF. It's a nonprofit that was founded in 1901 to buy and develop land in Palestine or at the time it was still Ottoman Syria. And since the JNF's creation, they have planted over 240 million trees in Israel. And it's been a commonly accepted way for Jews in the diaspora to build relationships with the land of Israel without physically living there. Amidstva, some might say. So whenever I heard the acronym JNF in the past, I had positive connotations. I didn't really think much about it until reading the ethnic cleansing of Palestine by Elon Pappay. Because early on in the book, he mentions JNF in the context of colonization. And immediately I was like, what? What's the tree people? Yep, the tree people. So later on, I was reading a part in the book about what happened to Palestinians after Israel declared independence in 1948. And here's where I like truly lost my mind. As we know, UN resolution wanted before called for the immediate repatriation of Palestinians, which Israel blatantly ignored. In the Arab Affairs Committee, which was created and run by Zionists, knew that they had to settle the Palestinian property strategically so that the whole world wouldn't turn against them. And one suggestion solution was, how about we sell it to the American Jews? According to international law, they couldn't sell the stolen land, so they had to come up with something else. So they suggested that perhaps that they could buy the land from the Arab that no longer wished to return. But that idea was struck down immediately by Joseph Whites, who was the head of the JNF at the time. You see, Whites had been very closely following Zionist colonization specifically of the rural areas of the land. And he worked really hard to make sure that as that land was colonized, all of it fell into JNF hands. So I'm quoting Whites word for word on what he suggested they do next. All we need is 400 tractors. Each tractor can cultivate 3,000 dunam, cultivating not just for the purpose of procuring food, but in order to prevent anyone returning to their lands. Land of lesser quality should be sold to private or public sectors. Members of the Arab Affairs Committee, who still had a little bit of humanity left, were opposed to this idea. And so they tried to find another solution. But before they could, Davi Bengorion got impatient. And so he decided to create a new committee of two to make the decision. And one of those two people was Joseph Whites. So of course, the decision they made focused on destruction and confiscation of the land. And it's insane to me because in Judaism, this is such a widely accepted form of gifting. And now that things have moved online, you can plant a tree in Israel for a multitude of reasons. Just at the click of a button. Check it out. Here's a pet certificate. And then we have the Coretta Scott King Forest certificate. And finally, we have the iTreeU certificate. I'm not quite sure that they ate with that one.",subjective

So I do not know if my synagogue fundraised and sent money to the IDF. I was not like I was not on the administrative side of things so I don't know if they were or not you know like I wasn't seeing the books I wasn't seeing the finances so they might have been sending money to the IDF I don't know but what I do know is that as a Hebrew school student they were having us donate money to the JNF to the Jewish National Fund and if you don't know what the JNF is you're not alone neither did we because they told us it was to plant trees in Israel right and they cover it as charity and so when you're Jewish charity or Sadaka is a very big deal it's a really big mitzvah and we are really really encouraged to give to other people it's very encouraged to do charity work it's very encouraged to just give whatever you can whenever you can you know and so that is something that we are taught very young and we are also taught that Jews really like trees we just we have a very deep connection with the land of Israel and the trees and stuff and so we're taught from a very young age that trees are great and we love trees right and so at least what we did at my synagogue is we would have this thing called we had Sadaka boxes and they were charity boxes and there would be a competition each year for how much each grade could raise for charity and sometimes it would go to a local charity they would give us like we would do choices right sometimes it would be and so some and we'd vote on it and so sometimes we would end up voting for like an animal shelter or like a local women's charity or a homeless shelter or something like that but because the JNF was so pushed by the synagogue and was everywhere like when you were younger you knew what the JNF was you would see it all like they had posters and maps and so you would see the logo everywhere and so you knew what the JNF was and people are like they plant trees they plant trees and you're like oh my god trees because you're four years old and you don't understand you're like I was I started kindergarten I started pre-k at my Hebrew school when I was four and I didn't know I never learned about the Palestinian conflict until I was like old enough to start being on the internet myself because I never learned it in secular school like history class because it's a very Eurocentric American-centric history that we learn in in secular school and then I never learned it in Hebrew school because we didn't want we didn't like talking about it we didn't talk about I did not know the Palestinian conflict was a thing okay and that is immense privilege and I know that but like I didn't even know what it was there was no way that I could push back against the propaganda that I was being force fed basically like I didn't how would I know it how do you know what you don't know until you're exposed to it and so once I started being on the internet more and being more exposed to it but it took years to break down the propaganda that I had been given steadily for 13 14 15 years so this is how we would do it so basically they have the charity box called the Sudaka box and the JNF has something called the Blue Box initiative so basically we would put our little money are and this was money I had saved from like birthdays holidays Hanukkah Christmas graduation good grade sometimes I would get like five dollars or whatever and so I'd I'd save up my money for Sudaka boxes because if you won that year if you raised the most money in charity for like the JNF that year you got like an ice cream party so I wanted to win that ice cream party and so I would save up my money to bring to stand at the Hebrew school for the JNF Sudaka box so as a kid you think you are giving to charity and your planting trees right all good things all great things what they don't tell you is they're using your money as a child to buy money buy money buy land out from under Palestinian people who are no longer there because they were forced out during the creation of state of Israel and even prior to the state of Israel they were still buying land out from under Palestinian landowners they are using your money to buy land to either have Israeli settlers come in and push out the existing communities or they're buying land and planting trees over what was once Palestinian towns villages houses and farms and fields so that's what they were spending our money on and they didn't tell us that I didn't learn that until fairly recently and if you just go on the JNF website it's incredibly insidious because now that I know what they're doing and now that I know what they're actually using my money for it's incredibly clear how they are covering and hiding what they're really doing to seem like they only care about developing and helping people and that is not what they're doing at all so this is part of their website and so this whole section this top section this is all about buying up land and displacing the existing communities and existing people and basically pushing a Bedouin development funny to me because they are actively pushing out the Bedouin communities as along with Palestinians so they're physically buying up the land with again children's charity money like I cannot stress enough how much they lied to us lying by a mission is still lying if I had known my money was going to kick people out of their homes or like to make sure that make it so that they can never come back to their homes I probably wouldn't have donated you know like if I had known actually what they're using your money for I probably would have donated to a animal shelter instead but they told us it was just and like even see how it down at the bottom it says plant trees in Israel that's what we were told as kids and so this whole first part the 400 million which is like the bulk of their stuff is to buy up land and develop communities and then import North American people and North American Jews for Aliyah which Aliyah just means you are from another country and you're moving to Israel now moving to another country is something that people do every day right so in that in and of itself is not bad what is bad is they are forcing out and by buying land they're forcing out other the existing communities in Israel and then they're importing Jews that they like or that think like them and so they're importing North American Jews to settle that land that used to belong to somebody else but they bought the land up right so it's like it's moving with the insidious undertone of displacing the local communities isn't it so fun isn't this so much fun so this is the second part it's called connecting the next generation this is their propaganda machine this is their if you'll see like Zionist programs and advocacy kindergarten through eighth grade so by the time I started to actually learn what Palestine was and the conflict and anything about the conflict I have been brainwashed since about pre-K since about kindergarten to think that Israel was this perfect oasis because they never told us anything differently was to think it was amazing and that anyone who said anything differently was being antisemitic because I'm Jewish and I know all about Israel and Israel is a really great place and you're just being antisemitic and so they're literally training us with all this money to basically train us to push back against any criticism of Israel for them so they don't have to do it themselves and then you'll see this is like international cooperation so like international propaganda all that good stuff positive Israel propaganda and this is the last part and this is so once they've they bought the land out from under the Palestinians they imported North Americans and they've propagandized to children to blindly support Israel this is now they're gonna develop that land that they stole and so this is kind of what they told us they were gonna do ignoring all of the stealing right so like this is the big part that they're like we plant trees in Israel but they're planned to get on land that they bought out from under Palestinians and so yeah so this is how the Israeli government works to acquire land for Israeli settlers it works through the JNF which is a charitable organization charitable so they don't get taxed they don't have to tell you where that money is going they're just like plant trees in Israel and then you're as a child accidentally supporting displaced Palestinians with charity money that you think is going to trees and it is not well it is but not in a good way so yeah if you ever want to know how did the is how did Israel get so much money to buy all of this Palestinian land and move Jews there it was by lying to children about where their charity money was going,subjective

Because when I was growing up, that was such a huge deal. And if you're not at you, the biggest reasons that we do this are for the birth of a child, for when someone becomes a bar about Mitzvah, or even like to memorialize someone after they have passed. And besides, like how cool is it to have a literal tree planted in your name in the Jewish homeland? I mean, for a Jewish American kid, it's pretty freaking cool. And when I went to Israel on my eighth grade trip with my Jewish day school, they even took us to a spot where we got to physically place a tree sapling into the ground in our own honor. It was so cool. So a little bit of background tree planting is done through the Jewish National Fund or the JNF. It's a nonprofit that was founded in 1901 to buy and develop land in Palestine or at the time it was still Ottoman Syria. And since the JNF's creation, they have planted over 240 million trees in Israel. And it's been a commonly accepted way for Jews in the diaspora to build relationships with the land of Israel without physically living there. Amidstva, some might say. So whenever I heard the acronym JNF in the past, I had positive connotations. I didn't really think much about it until reading the ethnic cleansing of Palestine by Elon Pappay. Because early on in the book, he mentions JNF in the context of colonization. And immediately I was like, what? What's the tree people? Yep, the tree people. So later on, I was reading a part in the book about what happened to Palestinians after Israel declared independence in 1948. And here's where I like truly lost my mind. As we know, UN resolution wanted before called for the immediate repatriation of Palestinians, which Israel blatantly ignored. In the Arab Affairs Committee, which was created and run by Zionists, knew that they had to settle the Palestinian property strategically so that the whole world wouldn't turn against them. And one suggestion solution was, how about we sell it to the American Jews? According to international law, they couldn't sell the stolen land, so they had to come up with something else. So they suggested that perhaps that they could buy the land from the Arab that no longer wished to return. But that idea was struck down immediately by Joseph Whites, who was the head of the JNF at the time. You see, Whites had been very closely following Zionist colonization specifically of the rural areas of the land. And he worked really hard to make sure that as that land was colonized, all of it fell into JNF hands. So I'm quoting Whites word for word on what he suggested they do next. All we need is 400 tractors. Each tractor can cultivate 3,000 dunam, cultivating not just for the purpose of procuring food, but in order to prevent anyone returning to their lands. Land of lesser quality should be sold to private or public sectors. Members of the Arab Affairs Committee, who still had a little bit of humanity left, were opposed to this idea. And so they tried to find another solution. But before they could, Davi Bengorion got impatient. And so he decided to create a new committee of two to make the decision. And one of those two people was Joseph Whites. So of course, the decision they made focused on destruction and confiscation of the land. And it's insane to me because in Judaism, this is such a widely accepted form of gifting. And now that things have moved online, you can plant a tree in Israel for a multitude of reasons. Just at the click of a button. Check it out. Here's a pet certificate. And then we have the Coretta Scott King Forest certificate. And finally, we have the iTreeU certificate. I'm not quite sure that they ate with that one.",subjective

What's currently going on in Israel? We're making a long story short. We're talking about a regime change. That's what's undergoing right now. How are these rallies responding? These rallies are responding in an amazing way. Hundreds of thousands of people are taken to the streets. And it is very, very powerful. And I hope it only inspires other people in other countries. How is the Arab society in your reactor so far? There's this straight line that connects the occupation. This discrimination against Arabs to the judicial coup that's happening right now. Everything is connected. And I think that the fact that a lot of the organizers of the protest movement who are refusing to at least publicly acknowledge this disconnection deters the masses from the Arab community to join. We don't have a problem with the essence of a Jewish country in a sense of a culturally Jewish country, a Jewish majority country. That's not the problem. The problem is with its foundations. What it means to be a Jewish country. Does it mean what Bangville and Vitalis Montritch want to offer us? Jewish supremacy? Or does it mean that this country is as Jewish just as America is unofficially Christian? And until these issues and these topics are talked about, I'm not hopeful that the Arab community will join in masses.",subjective

Well, in Israel, 21% of the population is Arab, roughly 1.9 million Israeli Arabs. The majority of them are Muslims. They enjoy full civil rights, equality, and of course, freedom of religion. In addition to that, Arabic is considered the holy language in Islam as the Quran was written in Arabic. And in Israel, Hebrew and Arabic are the official languages in the state of Israel. But fine, we're talking about freedom of religion for Muslims in Israel and blah, blah, blah. But are Muslims safe and protected in Israel? Well, the Muslim population in Israel has increased about 10 fold since the state was established. From some 156,000 in 1949 to over 1.5 million today, there are over 400 mosques in Israel. 73 of them are located in Jerusalem alone. So not only Muslims are safe in Israel, but they are happy and thriving, and these are the facts. Muslims are part of the Israeli society. Many of them volunteer to join the army, become doctors, bank managers, judges, ministers, police officers, and more. As a Jew myself, I consider the Muslims my brothers and sisters. I love them. So Ramadan Mubarak, to all the Muslims celebrating, may we continue to come closer to one another, united for peace, united against radicalism and terrorism.",subjective

This is a brainwash. I can't vote. I can get elected. I become the president of Israel if I want right now to nominate myself whether I win or not. That's different. I don't have a different bus system. I don't have different judges. In fact, an Arab judge, an Arab judge in Israel, Supreme Court judge, sent to prison a Jewish prime minister and Jewish president. I don't want you to believe me. I want you to check the name. Selim Jubran. In an apartheid that cannot happen. I have freedom of movement. I came to New Zealand with my Israeli passport as an Arab. No one can stop me. And by the way, it doesn't mean that racism does not exist or discrimination. But you want to tell me that also in New Zealand racism and discrimination does not exist. Unfortunately, it exists everywhere. What about Hamas? Yeah, no. It's not. I mean, it's rough. It's like, look, Hamas controls the Gaza. Israel does not control Gaza. Yeah. So Israel does not have even one inch. Hamas has a border with Egypt. And Egypt calls that border as well. So why an Arab state closed the border with an Arab Gaza? Because of terrorism, helping us is not lying more about this or promoting the brainwashed of this. I don't live under apartheid regime. The president has problems which we need to resolve. But the obstacle is not actually Israel. The obstacle right now is terrorist organization from Gaza and the corrupted Palestinian Authority. I hope I managed to pass something.

How is the Arab society in your reactor so far? There's this straight line that connects the occupation. This discrimination against Arabs to the judicial coup that's happening right now. Everything is connected. And I think that the fact that a lot of the organizers of the protest movement who are refusing to at least publicly acknowledge this disconnection deters the masses from the Arab community to join. We don't have a problem with the essence of a Jewish country in a sense of a culturally Jewish country, a Jewish majority country. That's not the problem. The problem is with its foundations. What it means to be a Jewish country. Does it mean what Bangville and Vitalis Montritch want to offer us? Jewish supremacy?

Well, in Israel, 21% of the population is Arab, roughly 1.9 million Israeli Arabs. The majority of them are Muslims. They enjoy full civil rights, equality, and of course, freedom of religion. In addition to that, Arabic is considered the holy language in Islam as the Quran was written in Arabic. And in Israel, Hebrew and Arabic are the official languages in the state of Israel. But fine, we're talking about freedom of religion for Muslims in Israel and blah, blah, blah. But are Muslims safe and protected in Israel? Well, the Muslim population in Israel has increased about 10 fold since the state was established. From some 156,000 in 1949 to over 1.5 million today, there are over 400 mosques in Israel. 73 of them are located in Jerusalem alone. So not only Muslims are safe in Israel, but they are happy and thriving, and these are the facts. Muslims are part of the Israeli society. Many of them volunteer to join the army, become doctors, bank managers, judges, ministers, police officers, and more. As a Jew myself, I consider the Muslims my brothers and sisters. I love them. So Ramadan Mubarak, to all the Muslims celebrating, may we continue to come closer to one another, united for peace, united against radicalism and terrorism.",subjective

Unfortunately, it exists everywhere. What about Hamas? Yeah, no. It's not. I mean, it's rough. It's like, look, Hamas controls the Gaza. Israel does not control Gaza. Yeah. So Israel does not have even one inch. Hamas has a border with Egypt. And Egypt calls that border as well. So why an Arab state closed the border with an Arab Gaza? Because of terrorism, helping us is not lying more about this or promoting the brainwashed of this. I don't live under apartheid regime. The president has problems which we need to resolve.

Well, in Israel, 21% of the population is Arab, roughly 1.9 million Israeli Arabs. The majority of them are Muslims. They enjoy full civil rights, equality, and of course, freedom of religion. In addition to that, Arabic is considered the holy language in Islam as the Quran was written in Arabic. And in Israel, Hebrew and Arabic are the official languages in the state of Israel. But fine, we're talking about freedom of religion for Muslims in Israel and blah, blah, blah. But are Muslims safe and protected in Israel? Well, the Muslim population in Israel has increased about 10 fold since the state was established. From some 156,000 in 1949 to over 1.5 million today, there are over 400 mosques in Israel. 73 of them are located in Jerusalem alone. So not only Muslims are safe in Israel, but they are happy and thriving, and these are the facts. Muslims are part of the Israeli society. Many of them volunteer to join the army, become doctors, bank managers, judges, ministers, police officers, and more. As a Jew myself, I consider the Muslims my brothers and sisters. I love them. So Ramadan Mubarak, to all the Muslims celebrating, may we continue to come closer to one another, united for peace, united against radicalism and terrorism.",subjective

I was proud to accept the responsibility of standing at the borders and protecting my country. Israel. What made me fall in love with Israel was the resilience of its people, and I'm proud to be part of that people. I'm proud to be me, and Israeli, Arab, Muslim, IDF soldier.",subjective

I don't know if any of those people who are in that club even speaks Arabic like me as an Arab. There are problems. I will never say that there isn't a problem. But I have to be honest with you. This is a brainwash. I can't vote. I can get elected. I become the president of Israel if I want right now to nominate myself whether I win or not. That's different. I don't have a different bus system. I don't have different judges. In fact, an Arab judge, an Arab judge in Israel, Supreme Court judge, sent to prison a Jewish prime minister and Jewish president. I don't want you to believe me. I want you to check the name. Selim Jubran. In an apartheid that cannot happen. I have freedom of movement. I came to New Zealand with my Israeli passport as an Arab. No one can stop me. And by the way, it doesn't mean that racism does not exist or discrimination. But you want to tell me that also in New Zealand racism and discrimination does not exist. Unfortunately, it exists everywhere. What about Hamas? Yeah, no. It's not. I mean, it's rough. It's like, look, Hamas controls the Gaza. Israel does not control Gaza. Yeah. So Israel does not have even one inch. Hamas has a border with Egypt. And Egypt calls that border as well. So why an Arab state closed the border with an Arab Gaza? Because of terrorism, helping us is not lying more about this or promoting the brainwashed of this. I don't live under apartheid regime. The president has problems which we need to resolve. But the obstacle is not actually Israel. The obstacle right now is terrorist organization from Gaza and the corrupted Palestinian Authority. I hope I managed to pass something. And also, maybe it did not change your mind. But maybe, maybe you asked more tough questions to the people who made you join this club.",subjective

These rallies are responding in an amazing way. Hundreds of thousands of people are taken to the streets. And it is very, very powerful. And I hope it only inspires other people in other countries. How is the Arab society in your reactor so far? There's this straight line that connects the occupation. This discrimination against Arabs to the judicial coup that's happening right now. Everything is connected. And I think that the fact that a lot of the organizers of the protest movement who are refusing to at least publicly acknowledge this disconnection deters the masses from the Arab community to join. We don't have a problem with the essence of a Jewish country in a sense of a culturally Jewish country, a Jewish majority country. That's not the problem. The problem is with its foundations. What it means to be a Jewish country. Does it mean what Bangville and Vitalis Montritch want to offer us? Jewish supremacy? Or does it mean that this country is as Jewish just as America is unofficially Christian? And until these issues and these topics are talked about, I'm not hopeful that the Arab community will join in masses.",subjective

Well, in Israel, 21% of the population is Arab, roughly 1.9 million Israeli Arabs. The majority of them are Muslims. They enjoy full civil rights, equality, and of course, freedom of religion. In addition to that, Arabic is considered the holy language in Islam as the Quran was written in Arabic. And in Israel, Hebrew and Arabic are the official languages in the state of Israel. But fine, we're talking about freedom of religion for Muslims in Israel and blah, blah, blah. But are Muslims safe and protected in Israel? Well, the Muslim population in Israel has increased about 10 fold since the state was established. From some 156,000 in 1949 to over 1.5 million today, there are over 400 mosques in Israel. 73 of them are located in Jerusalem alone. So not only Muslims are safe in Israel, but they are happy and thriving, and these are the facts. Muslims are part of the Israeli society. Many of them volunteer to join the army, become doctors, bank managers, judges, ministers, police officers, and more. As a Jew myself, I consider the Muslims my brothers and sisters. I love them. So Ramadan Mubarak, to all the Muslims celebrating, may we continue to come closer to one another, united for peace, united against radicalism and terrorism.",subjective

Do you know if there are any long-term repercussions that come from refusing to serve a long conscientious grounds? Going out publicly and talking about refusing service, there is a huge social cost. I have the privilege to come out publicly, I have a supportive family and supportive friends, but a lot of refusesers don't have these supportive nets. It can cost friendships, but if someone doesn't respect me for my opinions and my beliefs, then I do not see friendship with them. What do you hope it's going to do in terms of the wider peace movement, and how do you hope to change people's minds? I hope to get to as many Israeli youth as possible and tell them that there is another option. Serving is not something that's going to happen forever and the army needs to change for there to be an actual solution in this place. We need to realize that non-violence is something normal. It's normal to non-violence and it's normal to want a solution here and that there are seven million Palestinians here and we need to acknowledge that fact that they're not going anywhere and live with them.",subjective

You cannot speak against the military because it's so entrenched in society. Like I said, a lot of conversations start with the military and because most people did serve, it's seen as this kind of thing that everyone needs the past in order to become an Israeli. Do you know if there are any long-term repercussions that come from refusing to serve a long conscientious grounds? Going out publicly and talking about refusing service, there is a huge social cost. I have the privilege to come out publicly, I have a supportive family and supportive friends, but a lot of refusesers don't have these supportive nets. It can cost friendships, but if someone doesn't respect me for my opinions and my beliefs, then I do not see friendship with them. What do you hope it's going to do in terms of the wider peace movement, and how do you hope to change people's minds? I hope to get to as many Israeli youth as possible and tell them that there is another option. Serving is not something that's going to happen forever and the army needs to change for there to be an actual solution in this place. We need to realize that non-violence is something normal.

You cannot speak against the military because it's so entrenched in society. Like I said, a lot of conversations start with the military and because most people did serve, it's seen as this kind of thing that everyone needs the past in order to become an Israeli. Do you know if there are any long-term repercussions that come from refusing to serve a long conscientious grounds? Going out publicly and talking about refusing service, there is a huge social cost. I have the privilege to come out publicly, I have a supportive family and supportive friends, but a lot of refusesers don't have these supportive nets. It can cost friendships, but if someone doesn't respect me for my opinions and my beliefs, then I do not see friendship with them. What do you hope it's going to do in terms of the wider peace movement, and how do you hope to change people's minds? I hope to get to as many Israeli youth as possible and tell them that there is another option. Serving is not something that's going to happen forever and the army needs to change for there to be an actual solution in this place. We need to realize that non-violence is something normal.

So first of all the word alia refers to the act of going up and when we talk about making alia we're talking about people who are permanently moving to the land of Israel. The becoming is really citizens and it is quite the process. There's a lot of paperwork involved and so what Neffes-Beneffes does is they facilitate the entire process.

You know it's like the choice you're making. You know you're going to have everybody recording you and they make like a really big deal.

I said they don't have the right to marry within their nationality anywhere in the world and bring that spouse to live with them, whereas Jewish Israelis do. You've changed the framing from Mary within one's nationality anywhere in the world and bring them to live with you to marry a Palestinian. And you said, well, look, it's also unfair for Jews. They can't do that either. Unless you think it's not unfair that Jewish Israelis can't marry someone from Gaza or the West Bank and bring that person to live with them. That's a hard point to argue. And it's even harder to argue that it's not more unfair for Palestinian Israelis because at the end of the day most people marry within their ethnic group. The only purpose of this law is to maintain the Jewish demographic majority in Israel. Kind of hard to argue that it's about anything else. Although you can argue that Israel should have a Jewish majority, but then you have to expose yourself to comparisons along the same lines. Like, what if the United States made it illegal for Jewish citizens of the US to marry a Jew from Israel and bring that spouse to live with them in the US? But hey, that's not legal discrimination because non-Jewish citizens of the US also can't marry a Jew from Israel and bring them to live with them in the US. That comparison might shock you because you might think how could Jews ever be targeted like that? You know, think of everything Jews have been through.

They are the group that remained in Israel despite the ethnic cleansing in 1948. They lived under Israeli military rule that applied only to them and not Jewish Israelis for 18 years between 1948 and 1966. They were made citizens but can never become nationals and enjoy equality unless they become Jewish which the law prohibits. They are the only Palestinians who can run and vote in Israeli elections and they can move relatively freely but the inequality against them was never dismantled and they face daily institutional discrimination including as members of parliament. And if this complex ID system wasn't enough to segregate the Palestinian community, in 2002 Israel introduced the law that prohibits family unification. That's right denying Palestinians the right to live with their loved ones if their ID cards are different. And this woman is one of thousands of Palestinians who Israel will not issue any ID card. She can't travel, can't hug her family, only see them meet us away across the border. Putting down roots, the family home, these are crucial parts of what make strong community. To make sure Palestinian communities can't develop any further Israel has made it almost impossible to grant building permits for Palestinian homes. So, Palestinians live in a catch 22 situation. In order to have shelter, to develop their communities they must build without a permit. And if they do so, Israel can demolish the structures on the basis that it was built without a permit. Right now there are over 150,000 Palestinians currently living under the constant threat of demolition and forced eviction. Many of them for the second or third time. In the West Bank an average of 18 Palestinian structures were demolished every week in 2020. The same year Israel issued 1,094 building permits for Jewish applicants and only one for Palestinian. This goes back to the heart of the issue. To maintain the state's character as Jewish, Israel systematically disadvantages Palestinians while privileging Jewish Israelis. This racist privilege has been enshrined in laws, policies and practices and it enables Palestinian resources to be taken in order to economically benefit Jewish Israeli citizens. The system of apartheid is the Israeli state's oppression and domination of Palestinians on a daily basis. It's the laws, the policies and the practices that it puts in place and then implements to control Palestinians daily lives. And then the crimes of apartheid, the crimes of apartheid are those acts, those violations, those patterns of violations that Israel is committing to create and then maintain that system of apartheid. Amnesty International and other rights organizations have been documenting patterns of human rights violations and international crimes for decades. These are the most visible and violent part of this system. At the end of May 2020, 4,236 Palestinians were held in Israeli prisons. 352, including two children, were held without charge or trial. Between September 2000 and February 2017, Israeli forces killed 4,868 Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories, including 1,793 children outside the context of armed conflict. An Amnesty International is not aware of any case in which an Israeli soldier has been convicted of a willfully causing the death of a Palestinian in the occupied territories since 1987. This imbalance of rights, justice and accountability is never more clear than when a Jewish Israeli life appears to have more value than a Palestinian. Israel is a partite and its cruel and prolonged strategies that liberally disadvantaged Palestinians wherever they live. They cannot claim and enjoy equality. Jewish Israelis. Look, everyone can make a difference. Together we need to speak out on behalf of Palestinians. We need to speak about the human rights violations that they are suffering. We need to talk about the apartheid, the system of apartheid to which they are subjected. Because by campaigning together, putting pressure on the Israeli state, we can have this system of apartheid dismantled. Join us, join our campaign. Everyone has the power to make a difference.",subjective

I said they don't have the right to marry within their nationality anywhere in the world and bring that spouse to live with them, whereas Jewish Israelis do. You've changed the framing from Mary within one's nationality anywhere in the world and bring them to live with you to marry a Palestinian. And you said, well, look, it's also unfair for Jews. They can't do that either. Unless you think it's not unfair that Jewish Israelis can't marry someone from Gaza or the West Bank and bring that person to live with them. That's a hard point to argue. And it's even harder to argue that it's not more unfair for Palestinian Israelis because at the end of the day most people marry within their ethnic group. The only purpose of this law is to maintain the Jewish demographic majority in Israel. Kind of hard to argue that it's about anything else. Although you can argue that Israel should have a Jewish majority, but then you have to expose yourself to comparisons along the same lines. Like, what if the United States made it illegal for Jewish citizens of the US to marry a Jew from Israel and bring that spouse to live with them in the US? But hey, that's not legal discrimination because non-Jewish citizens of the US also can't marry a Jew from Israel and bring them to live with them in the US.

They are the group that remained in Israel despite the ethnic cleansing in 1948. They lived under Israeli military rule that applied only to them and not Jewish Israelis for 18 years between 1948 and 1966. They were made citizens but can never become nationals and enjoy equality unless they become Jewish which the law prohibits. They are the only Palestinians who can run and vote in Israeli elections and they can move relatively freely but the inequality against them was never dismantled and they face daily institutional discrimination including as members of parliament. And if this complex ID system wasn't enough to segregate the Palestinian community, in 2002 Israel introduced the law that prohibits family unification. That's right denying Palestinians the right to live with their loved ones if their ID cards are different. And this woman is one of thousands of Palestinians who Israel will not issue any ID card. She can't travel, can't hug her family, only see them meet us away across the border. Putting down roots, the family home, these are crucial parts of what make strong community. To make sure Palestinian communities can't develop any further Israel has made it almost impossible to grant building permits for Palestinian homes. So, Palestinians live in a catch 22 situation. In order to have shelter, to develop their communities they must build without a permit. And if they do so, Israel can demolish the structures on the basis that it was built without a permit. Right now there are over 150,000 Palestinians currently living under the constant threat of demolition and forced eviction. Many of them for the second or third time. In the West Bank an average of 18 Palestinian structures were demolished every week in 2020. The same year Israel issued 1,094 building permits for Jewish applicants and only one for Palestinian. This goes back to the heart of the issue. To maintain the state's character as Jewish, Israel systematically disadvantages Palestinians while privileging Jewish Israelis. This racist privilege has been enshrined in laws, policies and practices and it enables Palestinian resources to be taken in order to economically benefit Jewish Israeli citizens. The system of apartheid is the Israeli state's oppression and domination of Palestinians on a daily basis. It's the laws, the policies and the practices that it puts in place and then implements to control Palestinians daily lives. And then the crimes of apartheid, the crimes of apartheid are those acts, those violations, those patterns of violations that Israel is committing to create and then maintain that system of apartheid. Amnesty International and other rights organizations have been documenting patterns of human rights violations and international crimes for decades. These are the most visible and violent part of this system. At the end of May 2020, 4,236 Palestinians were held in Israeli prisons. 352, including two children, were held without charge or trial. Between September 2000 and February 2017, Israeli forces killed 4,868 Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories, including 1,793 children outside the context of armed conflict. An Amnesty International is not aware of any case in which an Israeli soldier has been convicted of a willfully causing the death of a Palestinian in the occupied territories since 1987. This imbalance of rights, justice and accountability is never more clear than when a Jewish Israeli life appears to have more value than a Palestinian. Israel is a partite and its cruel and prolonged strategies that liberally disadvantaged Palestinians wherever they live. They cannot claim and enjoy equality. Jewish Israelis. Look, everyone can make a difference. Together we need to speak out on behalf of Palestinians. We need to speak about the human rights violations that they are suffering. We need to talk about the apartheid, the system of apartheid to which they are subjected. Because by campaigning together, putting pressure on the Israeli state, we can have this system of apartheid dismantled. Join us, join our campaign. Everyone has the power to make a difference.",subjective

And of course, those Arabs have equal rights. So the Palestinians live in the West Bank and in Gaza. The Palestinians don't have an Israeli ID. They don't have a blue ID. They are not citizens of Israel. Instead, they are under the Palestinian Authority rule. So the Palestinian Authority issues their IDs. They are called green IDs. You can't have both IDs. You can have an Israeli citizenship or a green ID. If you're a Palestinian that becomes an Israeli citizen and it's possible, you have to lose your green ID. The Palestinians because they are not citizens of Israel, they can't enter freely to Israel. They must have a permit. For example, I traveled to India. I'm not an Indian citizen. So I had to get a visa to enter the country. So a lot of Palestinians can enter Israel with permits that the IDF issues. Most people get a work permit, which allows them to work in Israel. So in Israel, they get a much higher salary. In Gaza, you get something like 800 checkers a month. And in Israel, it's like 8,000. So on a daily basis, there are hundreds of thousands of Palestinian workers who come to work in Israel. And also like other kinds of permits, like medical treatment, Christian holidays, Muslim holidays, wedding, the IDF just runs a background check.

This is my Israeli ID. And... Army is Emption Card. I didn't serve any army. Last week I submitted an application to renowned Smisraeli citizenship in the consulate here in Toronto. It wasn't the decision I made lightly. I've been thinking about it for a long time. In fact, from the moment I learned about the real history of the place where I grew up, the history that wasn't taught to us in schools or even talked about while I was living there. Until last week at the consulate, it's been a really long process that took two decades. Yes, I did it in response to Israel's horrific assault on Gaza. But since this isn't the first time that Israeli's bombing Gaza, why now? Why this moment? Because the amount of casualties has reached catastrophic proportions. And even though we're in a temporary ceasefire or a pauser, whatever you want to call it right now, it seems like it's not going to end anytime soon. And even Israeli officials are saying that after the pause, they intend to keep bombing food two more months, at least. Whether Israel realizes that or not, all this death harms its own people as well. It feels like Israel is playing a game even right now. The situation right now, using words like winning, trying to one-up the other side, as much as possible, even though the context is thousands of dead civilians. Israeli soldiers make mocking TikTok videos on top of the ruins of Palestinian homes in Gaza. Why am I doing this now? Because more than ever, it's clear to me now that in Israel peace is not the goal. And I don't know if it ever was. And when I think back on my childhood and all the times we spent running in and out of the bomb shelter, all the times my parents were worried about us, all the time I spent worrying while putting on a brave face like we were encouraged to. I feel like it's the kind of state that doesn't care about its own people.

This is my Israeli ID. And... Army exemption card. I didn't serve any army. Last week, I submitted an application to renowned my Israeli citizenship in the consulate here in Toronto. It wasn't the decision I made lightly. I've been thinking about it for a long time. In fact, from the moment I learned about the real history of the place where I grew up, the history that wasn't taught to us in schools or even talked about while I was living there. Until, last week at the consulate, it's been a really long process that took two decades. Yes, I did it in response to Israel's horrific assault on Gaza. But since this isn't the first time that Israel is bombing Gaza, why now? Why this moment? Because the amount of casualties has reached catastrophic proportions. And even though we're in a temporary ceasefire or a pauser, whatever you want to call it right now, it seems like it's not going to end anytime soon. And even Israeli officials are saying that after the pause, they intend to keep bombing for two more months, at least. Whether Israel realizes that or not, all this death harms its own people as well. It feels like Israel is playing a game even right now, the situation right now, using words like winning, trying to one-up the other side. As much as possible, even though the context is thousands of dead civilians, Israeli soldiers make mocking TikTok videos on top of the ruins of Palestinian homes in Gaza. Why am I doing this now? Because more than ever, it's clear to me now that in Israel peace is not the goal. And I don't know if it ever was. And when I think back on my childhood and all the times we spent running in and out of the bomb shelter, all the times my parents were worried about us, all the time I spent worrying, while putting on a brave face like we were encouraged to. I feel like it's the kind of state that doesn't care about its own people.

So it's really an honor to get invited on this flight and I cannot wait to share it all with you. So tomorrow morning is when I leave and I'm going to be in Israel for maybe 36 hours. I'm going to be in Israel until Thursday night basically and I arrive back home on Friday morning because my family's going to Florida next week. So it's a really quick trip but it's worth it. If you don't know what making alia means let me explain to you. So first of all the word alia refers to the act of going up and when we talk about making alia we're talking about people who are permanently moving to the land of Israel. The becoming is really citizens and it is quite the process. There's a lot of paperwork involved and so what Neffes-Beneffes does is they facilitate the entire process. So you go to their website you apply to make alia and then they take you through step-by-step soup to nuts the entire process and that actually can include helping you find the right community in Israel and they've actually helped over 75,000 Jewish people make alia at this point. So it's really going to be so cool to take you through that that flight that I'm going to be going on. Not everybody goes on the big charter flights like this. You know it's like the choice you're making. You know you're going to have everybody recording you and they make like a really big deal. I mean it's a big big celebration for someone to make alia and to move to Israel. So it's an honor to be a part of it. I know that 36 hours in Israel is a little bit crazy but it's totally worth it and thank God I was just in Israel this summer and my family is planning to go back again in January for a really fun winter break trip. My parents are going to come on that one so it's going to be really cool.

The move has to receive wide support from the political class in Germany, with many of the country's 15 other states expected to implement similar rules. Supporters say it will combat antisemitism and highlights Germany's historical responsibility to Israel and its security.

Notice how you've shifted the framing here from where you asked me to name one right that Jewish Israelis have, that Israeli Palestinians don't. I said they don't have the right to marry within their nationality anywhere in the world and bring that spouse to live with them, whereas Jewish Israelis do. You've changed the framing from Mary within one's nationality anywhere in the world and bring them to live with you to marry a Palestinian. And you said, well, look, it's also unfair for Jews. They can't do that either. Unless you think it's not unfair that Jewish Israelis can't marry someone from Gaza or the West Bank and bring that person to live with them. That's a hard point to argue. And it's even harder to argue that it's not more unfair for Palestinian Israelis because at the end of the day most people marry within their ethnic group. The only purpose of this law is to maintain the Jewish demographic majority in Israel. Kind of hard to argue that it's about anything else. Although you can argue that Israel should have a Jewish majority, but then you have to expose yourself to comparisons along the same lines. Like, what if the United States made it illegal for Jewish citizens of the US to marry a Jew from Israel and bring that spouse to live with them in the US? But hey, that's not legal discrimination because non-Jewish citizens of the US also can't marry a Jew from Israel and bring them to live with them in the US. That comparison might shock you because you might think how could Jews ever be targeted like that? You know, think of everything Jews have been through.

They are the group that remained in Israel despite the ethnic cleansing in 1948. They lived under Israeli military rule that applied only to them and not Jewish Israelis for 18 years between 1948 and 1966. They were made citizens but can never become nationals and enjoy equality unless they become Jewish which the law prohibits. They are the only Palestinians who can run and vote in Israeli elections and they can move relatively freely but the inequality against them was never dismantled and they face daily institutional discrimination including as members of parliament. And if this complex ID system wasn't enough to segregate the Palestinian community, in 2002 Israel introduced the law that prohibits family unification. That's right denying Palestinians the right to live with their loved ones if their ID cards are different. And this woman is one of thousands of Palestinians who Israel will not issue any ID card. She can't travel, can't hug her family, only see them meet us away across the border. Putting down roots, the family home, these are crucial parts of what make strong community. To make sure Palestinian communities can't develop any further Israel has made it almost impossible to grant building permits for Palestinian homes. So, Palestinians live in a catch 22 situation. In order to have shelter, to develop their communities they must build without a permit. And if they do so, Israel can demolish the structures on the basis that it was built without a permit. Right now there are over 150,000 Palestinians currently living under the constant threat of demolition and forced eviction. Many of them for the second or third time. In the West Bank an average of 18 Palestinian structures were demolished every week in 2020. The same year Israel issued 1,094 building permits for Jewish applicants and only one for Palestinian. This goes back to the heart of the issue. To maintain the state's character as Jewish, Israel systematically disadvantages Palestinians while privileging Jewish Israelis. This racist privilege has been enshrined in laws, policies and practices and it enables Palestinian resources to be taken in order to economically benefit Jewish Israeli citizens. The system of apartheid is the Israeli state's oppression and domination of Palestinians on a daily basis. It's the laws, the policies and the practices that it puts in place and then implements to control Palestinians daily lives. And then the crimes of apartheid, the crimes of apartheid are those acts, those violations, those patterns of violations that Israel is committing to create and then maintain that system of apartheid. Amnesty International and other rights organizations have been documenting patterns of human rights violations and international crimes for decades. These are the most visible and violent part of this system. At the end of May 2020, 4,236 Palestinians were held in Israeli prisons. 352, including two children, were held without charge or trial. Between September 2000 and February 2017, Israeli forces killed 4,868 Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories, including 1,793 children outside the context of armed conflict. An Amnesty International is not aware of any case in which an Israeli soldier has been convicted of a willfully causing the death of a Palestinian in the occupied territories since 1987. This imbalance of rights, justice and accountability is never more clear than when a Jewish Israeli life appears to have more value than a Palestinian. Israel is a partite and its cruel and prolonged strategies that liberally disadvantaged Palestinians wherever they live. They cannot claim and enjoy equality. Jewish Israelis. Look, everyone can make a difference. Together we need to speak out on behalf of Palestinians. We need to speak about the human rights violations that they are suffering. We need to talk about the apartheid, the system of apartheid to which they are subjected. Because by campaigning together, putting pressure on the Israeli state, we can have this system of apartheid dismantled. Join us, join our campaign. Everyone has the power to make a difference.",subjective

This is my Israeli passport. I have an Israeli citizenship. We also call it a blue ID. More than 9.5 million people have Israeli citizenship. And about 20% of them are Arabs. And of course, those Arabs have equal rights. So the Palestinians live in the West Bank and in Gaza. The Palestinians don't have an Israeli ID. They don't have a blue ID. They are not citizens of Israel. Instead, they are under the Palestinian Authority rule. So the Palestinian Authority issues their IDs. They are called green IDs. You can't have both IDs. You can have an Israeli citizenship or a green ID. If you're a Palestinian that becomes an Israeli citizen and it's possible, you have to lose your green ID. The Palestinians because they are not citizens of Israel, they can't enter freely to Israel. They must have a permit. For example, I traveled to India. I'm not an Indian citizen. So I had to get a visa to enter the country. So a lot of Palestinians can enter Israel with permits that the IDF issues. Most people get a work permit, which allows them to work in Israel. So in Israel, they get a much higher salary. In Gaza, you get something like 800 checkers a month. And in Israel, it's like 8,000. So on a daily basis, there are hundreds of thousands of Palestinian workers who come to work in Israel. And also like other kinds of permits, like medical treatment, Christian holidays, Muslim holidays, wedding, the IDF just runs a background check.

These bright yellow railings were installed at the platform at the one train stop at a hundred ninety first street over the weekend. Personal opinion. I like them. Take it provides safety. I think it's a good thing. Some at this Washington Heights stop telling us the railings do make them feel safer. And the MTA says that's the goal. They're designed to stop people from falling on the tracks and the railings are aligned. So the subway doors don't open in front of them. These new barriers are part of a pilot program. Last year, safety barriers were installed at three other city subway stations. Still some say it's not enough. It feels a little bit too little in a way. It's like they see different cities across, you know, not necessarily the country with the world that has have much more robust security. It's kind of like we should have that too. So could be not enough, I'd say. Back out here in Washington Heights, we're told that there are several other subway stops that'll be part of this pilot program, including two other stops in Brooklyn. After those get rolled out, the MTA will then look to evaluate the effectiveness of the subway railings as well as people's response to the railings and decide where to roll them out next.",subjective

Far too often I've seen videos of people trying to kick in a front door or trying to push their way past the homeowner in order to get in. So we want to create a barrier between you and someone else and one of the ways to do that is by using an all-skill security screen door. Now the doors where they have the glass front and the mesh on the bottom, those are nice for a spring day when you have a breeze coming through or something like that. But they do basically nothing for you as far as creating that barrier between security. It's still easy to kick through those rip them off, break through the glass, something like that and then access the inside of your home. So what you're looking for is again you want metal rods, you want steel on the screen and this is going to stop again someone being able to come in. The other thing I like about something like this is when I'm standing on the inside and you're talking to me if you're visiting my home, you can't necessarily, if I stand about a foot away from the door, you can't necessarily see who I am and what I look like. It is okay to have that barrier between you and the person. You don't have to open up, you don't have to be face to face. It is okay to come across slightly rude.

Maritime security barriers have one job to prevent unauthorized boats from getting in, because boats could be used as weapons, and the US Navy learned this the hard way during an incident in 2000, when a suicide boat packed with explosives blew up next to USS Cole, killing 17 sailors, injuring 39 others, and damaging the ship. Since then, the US Navy began investigating and later employing maritime security barriers, which are highly visible to physically exclude an area like a port or shipyard from reach. And if a boat runs into the barrier really fast, they are guaranteed to take a pretty good beating, but the barriers remain functional due to their high tensile strength and foam filled floats. This gun has unusual ammunition, but how it works is not what you think. Once you shoot this gun, your work is done. You just wait and watch the next boat that goes over it. The boat stopper can also be installed on patrol boats to stop unauthorized vessels from entering ports and waterways, and it works by cancelling up a rope in their engine propellers, but the system can also help against pirates. A series of training wires can be brought out on the sides and the stern of the ship, and if a pirate boat tries to get too close, there's a good chance that this would happen to them and make them think twice. A quick stop like this could in fact be dangerous for pirates.",subjective

But the Bible never says that a peace treaty will be signed and then in seven years time Jesus comes back. Jesus says no one knows the day of the hour of his return. If you could now count down seven years, because there's a peace treaty seven years until Jesus returns, then you could predict the day and the hour and so on when Jesus is going to return. You could know when he's going to come. But Jesus says he's going to come back like a thief in the night. A thief does not give you a seven year warning when he's going to come. The thief comes suddenly and unexpectedly and that'll be like the return of Jesus. Nobody knows. In fact, the disciples in Acts chapter 1, they ask Jesus, when are you going to set up your kingdom? Basically, when are you going to return and restore the kingdom to Israel? You know, Jesus' response was such an interesting response. He says this, it's not for you to know times or seasons that the Father is fixed by his own authority and he goes on to say it's your job instead to be my witnesses and Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. So don't listen to anyone who makes any predictions about the return of Christ when it's going to be. He could come back in 50,000 years or in 50 minutes time from now. Either way, be ready. How do you get ready by trusting that Jesus died for your sin? That's how you get ready. And in the meantime, let's get busy telling others about Jesus because that's why he's delaying so that more people can hear, believe in the gospel, and be saved.",subjective

We brought you this earlier in the show, but now we're getting some new information. The US and Saudi Arabia have agreed on a tentative deal for Saudi Arabia to officially recognize Israel. New New York's correspondent Daniel Cohen live in Tel Aviv with details. Daniel. Yeah, good morning, Sean. Good morning, Emma. Historic, enormous, huge, right? And all of those words are apropos to describe what we're talking about here. Let me just set the table for you in case you're just catching up. Okay. The US and Saudi Arabia have agreed on the broad contours of a deal for Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel in exchange for concession to the Palestinians. Also Saudi Arabia wants US security guarantees. And I think this is the bigger thing for them to help with their civilian nuclear program. Now that is according to US officials who were quoted off the record. And as you said, and you set this up the right way, a lot of this is not a done deal yet. In fact, the White House, we're hearing off the record expressing cautious optimism that something can be done in the next nine to 12 months, but they have gone from hammering out larger details to some of the finer details. Listen, I heard people here in Israel, people I respect, and it admire that no Middle East foreign policy way more than I do call it the mother of all Middle East peace deals. The Saudi conference, Mohammed bin Salman, a man in his late 30s, the de facto ruler of the King of Saudi Arabia. He's been meeting in Jeddah for the last few weeks. In fact, months with Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national security advisor, trying to get these talks moving. So now we're hearing their talking specifics. So the significant concession from Israel would be help promoting the creation of a Palestinian state. That's what they're saying. I have to tell you I am not hearing that at all here in Israel. In return, the United States would be pressing Saudi Arabia to impose limits on its growing relationship with China. Now Prime Minister Netanyaku, I've been checking his Twitter. I've been checking anything. Hasn't said anything publicly yet. But since I've been here in Israel and recovering this for you here in Newsmax, he has said publicly there is no way that he will give up an inch of sovereign Israeli soil to create a Palestinian state. He has said he's willing to make moderate or light concessions. What does that mean? I don't know. But that's antithetical to the ultra orthodox that serve in the Kinesic right now ministers to be these rights who say openly that they don't want to create a Palestinian state. They want to take land back from the Palestinians, including the temple mount. So this is very big news. We're still waiting to see specific details. But if there's a if there's a deal in principle between the United States, brokering, obviously this is a this is huge. And on the on the heels of the Abraham Accords, probably the highest accomplishment of President Trump because it brought peace between Israel, Bahrain, the U. A. E. Barakko and Sudan. Some people said that President Trump would have won a second term or if he was still president, that this Saudi deal would have already been done. That's nearly here and no there, but President Biden clearly writing some of the momentum, some of the I guess greasing the skids, maybe maybe a better term, but of the Abraham Accords and all the success that we've seen and trade and business there, economic partnership, but a deal with Saudi Arabia, recognizing Israel and bringing some sort of peace here is enormous.

How's it fit into the narrative? Well, the Bible tells us in Revelation chapter 13 verses 16 to 18 about this mark of the beast. It's the only time the Bible really refers to it. And the word mark there in the Greek language means it like a tattoo really or an etching or something that's scratched into something. So it says it's going to be upon the right hand or the forehead and it says you can't buy or sell if you don't have the mark of the beast. Now people wonder all about this is some kind of chip that's under the skin or computer chip or barcode. There's been all kinds of speculation. The mark of the beast is 666 there in the book of Revelation. And what I think this is is it says there that it's the number of a man's name. Now some have taken 666 to be one short of 777. In other words, God is perfection with seven. And this shows that this anachryst who says he's God is actually 666. But I think it's actually going to be the numerical value of his name. In other words, you can like in the Greek and Hebrew language, you can take the letters of the alphabet. They have numerical value. And so you can take a person's name and actually add that up and you come up with a number. So I think his number will, his name will actually equal 666. That's how he'll be identified. So when people take that mark on the right hand or forehead, they'll actually be taking his name upon them, which pictures the idea of ownership. Is this during the time of Antichrist when Antichrist is at his prominent place in the world of leadership and basically the execution of how economy is done will be through this mark? That's right. It's going to be that last three and a half years I take it of this coming time of seven years of tribulation on the earth when he's going to rule the world. So not only will there be a one world government, but there will be a one world economy. And we can see how that can happen today very easily. The tribulation period as you understand it is a seven year period according to biblical truth. Most do see it divided into two segments. Is the first half different than the second half? It is. One of the things I always like to point out too is a lot of people think the rapture starts the seven year tribulation. The seven year tribulation starts at annual 927 tells us when the Antichrist makes a treaty with Israel. So you know the rapture could happen today and the tribulation could start next week, next month, maybe a year or two from then. There could be a gap of time that will allow for some further preparation. But at some point in time this Antichrist figure is going to come on the scene and make a treaty the Bible says with Israel. And that's going to trigger this seven year period of time. But it's divided in Daniel 927 into two halves. There's a first half and a second half to it. The first half of that period of time Israel is going to enjoy peace. And I think at the beginning of the tribulation there's going to be a time of worldwide peace. Says in Thessalonians while men are saying peace and safety then sudden destruction is going to come on them. So the world is going to finally get its desire of having some peace and prosperity. But at the midpoint of that tribulation period there's going to be some events that happen that trigger the Antichrist in is going to take the world over. And so that second half of the tribulation period that last three and a half years he's going to dominate the world and rule the world. And it's going to be a rand of terror. It's going to come really when he's on the earth. So the first half is going to be Antichrist forming the coalition or made the coalition with other nations around the world and a peace treaty is signed with us. So there's peace and we've got the global currency going on with the mark of the beast. And so there's prosperity and then we'll move into the second half. Is there any tip point? Is it the signing of the peace treaty? How far along is it? Is it maybe three and a half years after the signing of the peace treaty that that begins to take? You'll see the peace and there's some kumbai yaw in the world. And then there's a tip point. And the last half is Antichrist basically breaking the deal? He does. He says at the midpoint of that covenant, that seven year period, he breaks the treaty with Israel. So I call it one of the greatest double crosses of all time. And then what he's going to do, the mask is going to come off at that point in time and he's going to begin to persecute the Jewish people because obviously God has made promises to them, Satan wants to get rid of them. And wipe them out. But he's going to dominate the world at that point in time. So this world is going to end with this great apostasy. The Bible calls it a great falling away when this one man is going to be worshipped as God. We've been talking about the end of the tribulation period. I guess the end really comes there, that seven year period at Armageddon. It does. You know, the Bible tells us the culmination of history of this age is the Battle of Armageddon and the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. And really they happen kind of in conjunction with one another. The Battle of Armageddon is interrupted by the Second Coming of Jesus. Harmageddon, that word's only used one time in the Bible. It's in Revelation chapter 16, verse 16 yet it's probably the one word that people know about the end times more than any other. But it's actually a literal place. In Hebrew the word harm means a hill or a mountain. And so it's really Mount McGito. And if anyone's ever been to Israel, they know that site there of McGito that overlooks the Jezreel Valley or the Valley of McGito. Twenty miles long, fourteen miles wide. Napoleon called it the world's most perfect battlefield. Interesting. And so the Bible tells us in the end times, right before the Second Coming of Christ, all the armies of the earth are going to be gathered there to the land of Israel. Now it's interesting it never tells us why. They may be gathered there because things haven't been going that well. They're going to come to try to destroy the Antichrist. Some believe it's there to try to once and for all wipe out the Jewish people. But what we do know is when the armies are gathered there to fight that the Lord Jesus is going to return from heaven. He's going to interrupt this battle of Armageddon. It's been called the Mother of All Wars. But that's where World History is going to end. One of the things I think is fascinating is I studied World History as a younger person. You end up all you studies wars. When you study World History. When you find my wars. We are. We're defined by wars. Every nation kind of is. And I really, history is going to ultimately culminate at this Mother of All Wars, this campaign of Armageddon. Mark as we continue. The birth of Israel does seem to be in 1940. That does seem to be the moment and time in history. When the church could look and say, okay, the prophecies for the most part have been completed. And then we move into the era since the end of World War II, the birth of Israel. And you see transportation acceleration. You see international communication. Things that probably even prior to World War II seem bizarre or strange to read. But today we've seen what's happened in the last 60 years. And it is phenomenal when you see how quick communication, banking, globalization as you mentioned. It all just seems to fall in line. Plus, all of the geographical activity that's happening with nation surrounding Israel. It just seems again to be taking us down a prophetic highway. Well it does because you read Ezekiel 38 and 39. It's a passage. Right after Ezekiel 37, it predicts the regathering of Israel in the end times. Ezekiel 38 and 39 mentions a coalition of nations that are going to invade Israel in the end times. One of them is Roche, which I believe is the nation of Russia. Is that the army to the north that you see? That you see over the Bible? Yeah, and also Persia's mentioned in that passage, which Persia was changed to Iran in 1935. Right. It became the Islamic Republic of Iran in the late 1970s. So here you have these nations mentioned and others as well there. Well, it's not very hard to envision those nations coming against Israel, what we see happening over there now. So a lot of the coalitions, the Bible speaks of in the end times are coming together just as the Scriptures predict. So there really are a lot of signs out there for us today that lead us to believe that the coming of Christ could be very soon. Practical application as a pastor, you're a theologian, you're a scholar, you spend a lot of time looking at the Bible through a prophetic lens. How can we as Christ followers best prepare is there a occupy until I come? Is there an aggressiveness or do we just, are we passive and just wait? What do we do? You know, back in the book of Hebrews, it says, don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together as the manner of some has been encouraged one another. And then it says, and do it all the more as you see the day drawing near. Now that must mean we can see the day drawing near. That really would make any sense. And so I think what that's telling us is, is we see the day drawing near. We ought to ratchet up our own spiritual lives, the intensity of it, the urgency. Every place that the coming of Christ is mentioned in the New Testament that I can think of, there's always practical application. And first Thessalonians four, some believers have died and he tells them about the rapture and he says, comfort one another with these words. And first, first Corinthians 15, he talks all about the rapture and he says, therefore, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord knowing your labor is not in vain. John 14, Jesus said, don't let your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me, in my Father's house or many dwelling places. But we're not so I would have told you, I go to prepare a place for you by going prepare a place for you. I will come again and receive you unto myself where I am there you may be also. So it's a comforting word. And then the last one I love is in 1 John chapter 3 where John says there in the passage, everyone who fixes his hope on him purifies himself, as he himself is pure. So the coming of the Lord is a purifying hope. So it's a purifying hope, it's a motivating hope, it's a comforting hope, it's a calming hope. Every place it's mentioned in the New Testament, there's always that application with it.

The Abraham Accords heralded the dawn of a new age of peace. But I believe that we are the cusp of an even more dramatic breakthrough, an historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Such a peace will go a long way to ending the Arab-Israeli conflict. It will encourage other Arab states to normalize their relations with Israel. It will enhance the prospects of peace with the Palestinians. It will encourage a broader reconciliation between Judaism and Islam, between Jerusalem and Mecca, between the descendants of Isaac and the descendants of Ishmael. All these are tremendous blessings. Two weeks ago, we saw another blessing already in sight. In the G20 conference, President Biden, by Minister Modi, and European and Arab leaders announced plans for a visionary corridor that will stretch across the Arabian Peninsula in Israel. It will connect India to Europe with maritime links, rail links, energy pipelines, fiber optic cables. This corridor will bypass maritime checkpoints or chokepoints rather, and dramatically lower the cost of goods, communication and energy for over 2 billion people. What a historic change for my country. You see, the land of Israel is situated in the crossroad between Africa, Asia and Europe. And for centuries, my country was repeatedly invaded by empires passing through it in their campaigns of plunder and conquest elsewhere. But today, as we tear down the walls of enmity, Israel can become a bridge of peace and prosperity between these continents. This between Israel and Saudi Arabia will truly create a new Middle East.",subjective

That's what people are saying on TikTok today, is that true? Well, there's been a lot of peace treaties with Israel already over the past decades, 1979, 1993. But the Bible never says that a peace treaty will be signed and then in seven years time Jesus comes back. Jesus says no one knows the day of the hour of his return. If you could now count down seven years, because there's a peace treaty seven years until Jesus returns, then you could predict the day and the hour and so on when Jesus is going to return. You could know when he's going to come. But Jesus says he's going to come back like a thief in the night. A thief does not give you a seven year warning when he's going to come. The thief comes suddenly and unexpectedly and that'll be like the return of Jesus. Nobody knows. In fact, the disciples in Acts chapter 1, they ask Jesus, when are you going to set up your kingdom? Basically, when are you going to return and restore the kingdom to Israel? You know, Jesus' response was such an interesting response. He says this, it's not for you to know times or seasons that the Father is fixed by his own authority and he goes on to say it's your job instead to be my witnesses and Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. So don't listen to anyone who makes any predictions about the return of Christ when it's going to be. He could come back in 50,000 years or in 50 minutes time from now. Either way, be ready. How do you get ready by trusting that Jesus died for your sin? That's how you get ready. And in the meantime, let's get busy telling others about Jesus because that's why he's delaying so that more people can hear, believe in the gospel, and be saved.",subjective

We brought you this earlier in the show, but now we're getting some new information. The US and Saudi Arabia have agreed on a tentative deal for Saudi Arabia to officially recognize Israel. New New York's correspondent Daniel Cohen live in Tel Aviv with details. Daniel. Yeah, good morning, Sean. Good morning, Emma. Historic, enormous, huge, right? And all of those words are apropos to describe what we're talking about here. Let me just set the table for you in case you're just catching up. Okay. The US and Saudi Arabia have agreed on the broad contours of a deal for Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel in exchange for concession to the Palestinians. Also Saudi Arabia wants US security guarantees. And I think this is the bigger thing for them to help with their civilian nuclear program. Now that is according to US officials who were quoted off the record. And as you said, and you set this up the right way, a lot of this is not a done deal yet. In fact, the White House, we're hearing off the record expressing cautious optimism that something can be done in the next nine to 12 months, but they have gone from hammering out larger details to some of the finer details. Listen, I heard people here in Israel, people I respect, and it admire that no Middle East foreign policy way more than I do call it the mother of all Middle East peace deals. The Saudi conference, Mohammed bin Salman, a man in his late 30s, the de facto ruler of the King of Saudi Arabia. He's been meeting in Jeddah for the last few weeks. In fact, months with Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national security advisor, trying to get these talks moving. So now we're hearing their talking specifics. So the significant concession from Israel would be help promoting the creation of a Palestinian state. That's what they're saying. I have to tell you I am not hearing that at all here in Israel. In return, the United States would be pressing Saudi Arabia to impose limits on its growing relationship with China. Now Prime Minister Netanyaku, I've been checking his Twitter. I've been checking anything. Hasn't said anything publicly yet. But since I've been here in Israel and recovering this for you here in Newsmax, he has said publicly there is no way that he will give up an inch of sovereign Israeli soil to create a Palestinian state. He has said he's willing to make moderate or light concessions. What does that mean? I don't know. But that's antithetical to the ultra orthodox that serve in the Kinesic right now ministers to be these rights who say openly that they don't want to create a Palestinian state. They want to take land back from the Palestinians, including the temple mount. So this is very big news. We're still waiting to see specific details. But if there's a if there's a deal in principle between the United States, brokering, obviously this is a this is huge. And on the on the heels of the Abraham Accords, probably the highest accomplishment of President Trump because it brought peace between Israel, Bahrain, the U. A. E. Barakko and Sudan. Some people said that President Trump would have won a second term or if he was still president, that this Saudi deal would have already been done. That's nearly here and no there, but President Biden clearly writing some of the momentum, some of the I guess greasing the skids, maybe maybe a better term, but of the Abraham Accords and all the success that we've seen and trade and business there, economic partnership, but a deal with Saudi Arabia, recognizing Israel and bringing some sort of peace here is enormous.

How's it fit into the narrative? Well, the Bible tells us in Revelation chapter 13 verses 16 to 18 about this mark of the beast. It's the only time the Bible really refers to it. And the word mark there in the Greek language means it like a tattoo really or an etching or something that's scratched into something. So it says it's going to be upon the right hand or the forehead and it says you can't buy or sell if you don't have the mark of the beast. Now people wonder all about this is some kind of chip that's under the skin or computer chip or barcode. There's been all kinds of speculation. The mark of the beast is 666 there in the book of Revelation. And what I think this is is it says there that it's the number of a man's name. Now some have taken 666 to be one short of 777. In other words, God is perfection with seven. And this shows that this anachryst who says he's God is actually 666. But I think it's actually going to be the numerical value of his name. In other words, you can like in the Greek and Hebrew language, you can take the letters of the alphabet. They have numerical value. And so you can take a person's name and actually add that up and you come up with a number. So I think his number will, his name will actually equal 666. That's how he'll be identified. So when people take that mark on the right hand or forehead, they'll actually be taking his name upon them, which pictures the idea of ownership. Is this during the time of Antichrist when Antichrist is at his prominent place in the world of leadership and basically the execution of how economy is done will be through this mark? That's right. It's going to be that last three and a half years I take it of this coming time of seven years of tribulation on the earth when he's going to rule the world. So not only will there be a one world government, but there will be a one world economy. And we can see how that can happen today very easily. The tribulation period as you understand it is a seven year period according to biblical truth. Most do see it divided into two segments. Is the first half different than the second half? It is. One of the things I always like to point out too is a lot of people think the rapture starts the seven year tribulation. The seven year tribulation starts at annual 927 tells us when the Antichrist makes a treaty with Israel. So you know the rapture could happen today and the tribulation could start next week, next month, maybe a year or two from then. There could be a gap of time that will allow for some further preparation. But at some point in time this Antichrist figure is going to come on the scene and make a treaty the Bible says with Israel. And that's going to trigger this seven year period of time. But it's divided in Daniel 927 into two halves. There's a first half and a second half to it. The first half of that period of time Israel is going to enjoy peace. And I think at the beginning of the tribulation there's going to be a time of worldwide peace. Says in Thessalonians while men are saying peace and safety then sudden destruction is going to come on them. So the world is going to finally get its desire of having some peace and prosperity. But at the midpoint of that tribulation period there's going to be some events that happen that trigger the Antichrist in is going to take the world over. And so that second half of the tribulation period that last three and a half years he's going to dominate the world and rule the world. And it's going to be a rand of terror. It's going to come really when he's on the earth. So the first half is going to be Antichrist forming the coalition or made the coalition with other nations around the world and a peace treaty is signed with us. So there's peace and we've got the global currency going on with the mark of the beast. And so there's prosperity and then we'll move into the second half. Is there any tip point? Is it the signing of the peace treaty? How far along is it? Is it maybe three and a half years after the signing of the peace treaty that that begins to take? You'll see the peace and there's some kumbai yaw in the world. And then there's a tip point. And the last half is Antichrist basically breaking the deal? He does. He says at the midpoint of that covenant, that seven year period, he breaks the treaty with Israel. So I call it one of the greatest double crosses of all time. And then what he's going to do, the mask is going to come off at that point in time and he's going to begin to persecute the Jewish people because obviously God has made promises to them, Satan wants to get rid of them. And wipe them out. But he's going to dominate the world at that point in time. So this world is going to end with this great apostasy. The Bible calls it a great falling away when this one man is going to be worshipped as God. We've been talking about the end of the tribulation period. I guess the end really comes there, that seven year period at Armageddon. It does. You know, the Bible tells us the culmination of history of this age is the Battle of Armageddon and the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. And really they happen kind of in conjunction with one another. The Battle of Armageddon is interrupted by the Second Coming of Jesus. Harmageddon, that word's only used one time in the Bible. It's in Revelation chapter 16, verse 16 yet it's probably the one word that people know about the end times more than any other. But it's actually a literal place. In Hebrew the word harm means a hill or a mountain. And so it's really Mount McGito. And if anyone's ever been to Israel, they know that site there of McGito that overlooks the Jezreel Valley or the Valley of McGito. Twenty miles long, fourteen miles wide. Napoleon called it the world's most perfect battlefield. Interesting. And so the Bible tells us in the end times, right before the Second Coming of Christ, all the armies of the earth are going to be gathered there to the land of Israel. Now it's interesting it never tells us why. They may be gathered there because things haven't been going that well. They're going to come to try to destroy the Antichrist. Some believe it's there to try to once and for all wipe out the Jewish people. But what we do know is when the armies are gathered there to fight that the Lord Jesus is going to return from heaven. He's going to interrupt this battle of Armageddon. It's been called the Mother of All Wars. But that's where World History is going to end. One of the things I think is fascinating is I studied World History as a younger person. You end up all you studies wars. When you study World History. When you find my wars. We are. We're defined by wars. Every nation kind of is. And I really, history is going to ultimately culminate at this Mother of All Wars, this campaign of Armageddon. Mark as we continue. The birth of Israel does seem to be in 1940. That does seem to be the moment and time in history. When the church could look and say, okay, the prophecies for the most part have been completed. And then we move into the era since the end of World War II, the birth of Israel. And you see transportation acceleration. You see international communication. Things that probably even prior to World War II seem bizarre or strange to read. But today we've seen what's happened in the last 60 years. And it is phenomenal when you see how quick communication, banking, globalization as you mentioned. It all just seems to fall in line. Plus, all of the geographical activity that's happening with nation surrounding Israel. It just seems again to be taking us down a prophetic highway. Well it does because you read Ezekiel 38 and 39. It's a passage. Right after Ezekiel 37, it predicts the regathering of Israel in the end times. Ezekiel 38 and 39 mentions a coalition of nations that are going to invade Israel in the end times. One of them is Roche, which I believe is the nation of Russia. Is that the army to the north that you see? That you see over the Bible? Yeah, and also Persia's mentioned in that passage, which Persia was changed to Iran in 1935. Right. It became the Islamic Republic of Iran in the late 1970s. So here you have these nations mentioned and others as well there. Well, it's not very hard to envision those nations coming against Israel, what we see happening over there now. So a lot of the coalitions, the Bible speaks of in the end times are coming together just as the Scriptures predict. So there really are a lot of signs out there for us today that lead us to believe that the coming of Christ could be very soon. Practical application as a pastor, you're a theologian, you're a scholar, you spend a lot of time looking at the Bible through a prophetic lens. How can we as Christ followers best prepare is there a occupy until I come? Is there an aggressiveness or do we just, are we passive and just wait? What do we do? You know, back in the book of Hebrews, it says, don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together as the manner of some has been encouraged one another. And then it says, and do it all the more as you see the day drawing near. Now that must mean we can see the day drawing near. That really would make any sense. And so I think what that's telling us is, is we see the day drawing near. We ought to ratchet up our own spiritual lives, the intensity of it, the urgency. Every place that the coming of Christ is mentioned in the New Testament that I can think of, there's always practical application. And first Thessalonians four, some believers have died and he tells them about the rapture and he says, comfort one another with these words. And first, first Corinthians 15, he talks all about the rapture and he says, therefore, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord knowing your labor is not in vain. John 14, Jesus said, don't let your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me, in my Father's house or many dwelling places. But we're not so I would have told you, I go to prepare a place for you by going prepare a place for you. I will come again and receive you unto myself where I am there you may be also. So it's a comforting word. And then the last one I love is in 1 John chapter 3 where John says there in the passage, everyone who fixes his hope on him purifies himself, as he himself is pure. So the coming of the Lord is a purifying hope. So it's a purifying hope, it's a motivating hope, it's a comforting hope, it's a calming hope. Every place it's mentioned in the New Testament, there's always that application with it. And I can't think of anything more comforting in these days in which we live than to know that Jesus is coming back someday and he's going to deliver us from the coming right.",subjective

The Abraham Accords heralded the dawn of a new age of peace. But I believe that we are the cusp of an even more dramatic breakthrough, an historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Such a peace will go a long way to ending the Arab-Israeli conflict. It will encourage other Arab states to normalize their relations with Israel. It will enhance the prospects of peace with the Palestinians. It will encourage a broader reconciliation between Judaism and Islam, between Jerusalem and Mecca, between the descendants of Isaac and the descendants of Ishmael. All these are tremendous blessings. Two weeks ago, we saw another blessing already in sight. In the G20 conference, President Biden, by Minister Modi, and European and Arab leaders announced plans for a visionary corridor that will stretch across the Arabian Peninsula in Israel. It will connect India to Europe with maritime links, rail links, energy pipelines, fiber optic cables. This corridor will bypass maritime checkpoints or chokepoints rather, and dramatically lower the cost of goods, communication and energy for over 2 billion people. What a historic change for my country. You see, the land of Israel is situated in the crossroad between Africa, Asia and Europe. And for centuries, my country was repeatedly invaded by empires passing through it in their campaigns of plunder and conquest elsewhere. But today, as we tear down the walls of enmity, Israel can become a bridge of peace and prosperity between these continents. This between Israel and Saudi Arabia will truly create a new Middle East.",subjective

There's a very long stalemate. It's not good But meanwhile the triple alliance is a problem and it's a very simple one Germany Austria-Hungary and Italy have to divide their troops to fight off the triple on time Russia-France Great Britain This is just not a winning strategy. I'm gonna fight a war on two fronts They will make the same mistake in World War II but they'll have the same problem at least in World War II eventually Italy is going to kind of switch sides Austria-Hungary and Germany are going to basically run out of resources and will be overpowered especially after the United States joins the war in 1917 After the sinking of the Lucidania a pastor so carrying a bunch of Americans So 1917 America joins the war when it's pretty much already won by the the triple on Todd On 11 11 1918 We have an armistice the fighting stops now. I'll pause to say this is obviously very simplified version of this story It's literally the length of a tic-tac In 1919 the great powers. I mean the leaders of both sides are gonna meet to make a peace treaty so Woodrow Wilson the president of the United States He says we demand the world be fed and safe to live in we can't be separated all these nice things he comes up with this cut this Agreement called the 14 points. He says there shouldn't be any secret peace treaties We should reduce our arms remove forces from various places use all bunch of new countries Would you create a League of Nations? How nice overall it sounds like it would be a pretty good treaty, but The rest of the world simply does not adopt it France and England bore the brunt of this war on the winning side Especially France where a lot of the fighting happened and they're gonna say no Sorry, Woodrow Wilson will do a League of Nations, but that's it Ironically America doesn't even join the League of Nations so then What we get says the treaty of Versailles if you remember Versailles from several units ago Louis the 14th 15th and 16th lived there so to Maria and Twinnett In the years after that it became basically this meeting place. This is where this treaty was decided and the Winners aside from the United States are going to say the worst Germany's fault and we must punish them They come up with the treaty of Versailles True Versailles is a very harsh treaty. They Make Germany admit that the war was their fault They make them disarm and basically give up their navy and all of their colonies They have to pay a comical amount of money for reparations there forbidden from having an Air Force all kinds of other punishments And Germany as we decided yes to discuss the other day is not specifically Personally to blame for this war, but they wind up being scapegoated they take the blame in the war guilt clause they are not allowed to join the League of Nations we see the maps redrawn in Eastern Europe and eventually The years of discontent and economic ruin that will follow Will lead to the emergence of Hitler in the Nazi Party.

You could know when he's going to come. But Jesus says he's going to come back like a thief in the night. A thief does not give you a seven year warning when he's going to come. The thief comes suddenly and unexpectedly and that'll be like the return of Jesus. Nobody knows. In fact, the disciples in Acts chapter 1, they ask Jesus, when are you going to set up your kingdom? Basically, when are you going to return and restore the kingdom to Israel? You know, Jesus' response was such an interesting response. He says this, it's not for you to know times or seasons that the Father is fixed by his own authority and he goes on to say it's your job instead to be my witnesses and Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. So don't listen to anyone who makes any predictions about the return of Christ when it's going to be. He could come back in 50,000 years or in 50 minutes time from now. Either way, be ready.

We brought you this earlier in the show, but now we're getting some new information. The US and Saudi Arabia have agreed on a tentative deal for Saudi Arabia to officially recognize Israel. New New York's correspondent Daniel Cohen live in Tel Aviv with details. Daniel. Yeah, good morning, Sean. Good morning, Emma. Historic, enormous, huge, right? And all of those words are apropos to describe what we're talking about here. Let me just set the table for you in case you're just catching up. Okay. The US and Saudi Arabia have agreed on the broad contours of a deal for Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel in exchange for concession to the Palestinians. Also Saudi Arabia wants US security guarantees. And I think this is the bigger thing for them to help with their civilian nuclear program. Now that is according to US officials who were quoted off the record. And as you said, and you set this up the right way, a lot of this is not a done deal yet. In fact, the White House, we're hearing off the record expressing cautious optimism that something can be done in the next nine to 12 months, but they have gone from hammering out larger details to some of the finer details. Listen, I heard people here in Israel, people I respect, and it admire that no Middle East foreign policy way more than I do call it the mother of all Middle East peace deals. The Saudi conference, Mohammed bin Salman, a man in his late 30s, the de facto ruler of the King of Saudi Arabia. He's been meeting in Jeddah for the last few weeks. In fact, months with Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national security advisor, trying to get these talks moving. So now we're hearing their talking specifics. So the significant concession from Israel would be help promoting the creation of a Palestinian state. That's what they're saying. I have to tell you I am not hearing that at all here in Israel. In return, the United States would be pressing Saudi Arabia to impose limits on its growing relationship with China. Now Prime Minister Netanyaku, I've been checking his Twitter. I've been checking anything. Hasn't said anything publicly yet. But since I've been here in Israel and recovering this for you here in Newsmax, he has said publicly there is no way that he will give up an inch of sovereign Israeli soil to create a Palestinian state. He has said he's willing to make moderate or light concessions. What does that mean? I don't know. But that's antithetical to the ultra orthodox that serve in the Kinesic right now ministers to be these rights who say openly that they don't want to create a Palestinian state. They want to take land back from the Palestinians, including the temple mount. So this is very big news. We're still waiting to see specific details. But if there's a if there's a deal in principle between the United States, brokering, obviously this is a this is huge. And on the on the heels of the Abraham Accords, probably the highest accomplishment of President Trump because it brought peace between Israel, Bahrain, the U. A. E. Barakko and Sudan. Some people said that President Trump would have won a second term or if he was still president, that this Saudi deal would have already been done. That's nearly here and no there, but President Biden clearly writing some of the momentum, some of the I guess greasing the skids, maybe maybe a better term, but of the Abraham Accords and all the success that we've seen and trade and business there, economic partnership, but a deal with Saudi Arabia, recognizing Israel and bringing some sort of peace here is enormous.

How's it fit into the narrative? Well, the Bible tells us in Revelation chapter 13 verses 16 to 18 about this mark of the beast. It's the only time the Bible really refers to it. And the word mark there in the Greek language means it like a tattoo really or an etching or something that's scratched into something. So it says it's going to be upon the right hand or the forehead and it says you can't buy or sell if you don't have the mark of the beast. Now people wonder all about this is some kind of chip that's under the skin or computer chip or barcode. There's been all kinds of speculation. The mark of the beast is 666 there in the book of Revelation. And what I think this is is it says there that it's the number of a man's name. Now some have taken 666 to be one short of 777. In other words, God is perfection with seven. And this shows that this anachryst who says he's God is actually 666. But I think it's actually going to be the numerical value of his name. In other words, you can like in the Greek and Hebrew language, you can take the letters of the alphabet. They have numerical value. And so you can take a person's name and actually add that up and you come up with a number. So I think his number will, his name will actually equal 666. That's how he'll be identified. So when people take that mark on the right hand or forehead, they'll actually be taking his name upon them, which pictures the idea of ownership. Is this during the time of Antichrist when Antichrist is at his prominent place in the world of leadership and basically the execution of how economy is done will be through this mark? That's right. It's going to be that last three and a half years I take it of this coming time of seven years of tribulation on the earth when he's going to rule the world. So not only will there be a one world government, but there will be a one world economy. And we can see how that can happen today very easily. The tribulation period as you understand it is a seven year period according to biblical truth. Most do see it divided into two segments. Is the first half different than the second half? It is. One of the things I always like to point out too is a lot of people think the rapture starts the seven year tribulation. The seven year tribulation starts at annual 927 tells us when the Antichrist makes a treaty with Israel. So you know the rapture could happen today and the tribulation could start next week, next month, maybe a year or two from then. There could be a gap of time that will allow for some further preparation. But at some point in time this Antichrist figure is going to come on the scene and make a treaty the Bible says with Israel. And that's going to trigger this seven year period of time. But it's divided in Daniel 927 into two halves. There's a first half and a second half to it. The first half of that period of time Israel is going to enjoy peace. And I think at the beginning of the tribulation there's going to be a time of worldwide peace. Says in Thessalonians while men are saying peace and safety then sudden destruction is going to come on them. So the world is going to finally get its desire of having some peace and prosperity. But at the midpoint of that tribulation period there's going to be some events that happen that trigger the Antichrist in is going to take the world over. And so that second half of the tribulation period that last three and a half years he's going to dominate the world and rule the world. And it's going to be a rand of terror. It's going to come really when he's on the earth. So the first half is going to be Antichrist forming the coalition or made the coalition with other nations around the world and a peace treaty is signed with us. So there's peace and we've got the global currency going on with the mark of the beast. And so there's prosperity and then we'll move into the second half. Is there any tip point? Is it the signing of the peace treaty? How far along is it? Is it maybe three and a half years after the signing of the peace treaty that that begins to take? You'll see the peace and there's some kumbai yaw in the world. And then there's a tip point. And the last half is Antichrist basically breaking the deal? He does. He says at the midpoint of that covenant, that seven year period, he breaks the treaty with Israel. So I call it one of the greatest double crosses of all time. And then what he's going to do, the mask is going to come off at that point in time and he's going to begin to persecute the Jewish people because obviously God has made promises to them, Satan wants to get rid of them. And wipe them out. But he's going to dominate the world at that point in time. So this world is going to end with this great apostasy. The Bible calls it a great falling away when this one man is going to be worshipped as God. We've been talking about the end of the tribulation period. I guess the end really comes there, that seven year period at Armageddon. It does. You know, the Bible tells us the culmination of history of this age is the Battle of Armageddon and the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. And really they happen kind of in conjunction with one another. The Battle of Armageddon is interrupted by the Second Coming of Jesus. Harmageddon, that word's only used one time in the Bible. It's in Revelation chapter 16, verse 16 yet it's probably the one word that people know about the end times more than any other. But it's actually a literal place. In Hebrew the word harm means a hill or a mountain. And so it's really Mount McGito. And if anyone's ever been to Israel, they know that site there of McGito that overlooks the Jezreel Valley or the Valley of McGito. Twenty miles long, fourteen miles wide. Napoleon called it the world's most perfect battlefield. Interesting. And so the Bible tells us in the end times, right before the Second Coming of Christ, all the armies of the earth are going to be gathered there to the land of Israel. Now it's interesting it never tells us why. They may be gathered there because things haven't been going that well. They're going to come to try to destroy the Antichrist. Some believe it's there to try to once and for all wipe out the Jewish people. But what we do know is when the armies are gathered there to fight that the Lord Jesus is going to return from heaven. He's going to interrupt this battle of Armageddon. It's been called the Mother of All Wars. But that's where World History is going to end. One of the things I think is fascinating is I studied World History as a younger person. You end up all you studies wars. When you study World History. When you find my wars. We are. We're defined by wars. Every nation kind of is. And I really, history is going to ultimately culminate at this Mother of All Wars, this campaign of Armageddon. Mark as we continue. The birth of Israel does seem to be in 1940. That does seem to be the moment and time in history. When the church could look and say, okay, the prophecies for the most part have been completed. And then we move into the era since the end of World War II, the birth of Israel. And you see transportation acceleration. You see international communication. Things that probably even prior to World War II seem bizarre or strange to read. But today we've seen what's happened in the last 60 years. And it is phenomenal when you see how quick communication, banking, globalization as you mentioned. It all just seems to fall in line. Plus, all of the geographical activity that's happening with nation surrounding Israel. It just seems again to be taking us down a prophetic highway. Well it does because you read Ezekiel 38 and 39. It's a passage. Right after Ezekiel 37, it predicts the regathering of Israel in the end times. Ezekiel 38 and 39 mentions a coalition of nations that are going to invade Israel in the end times. One of them is Roche, which I believe is the nation of Russia. Is that the army to the north that you see? That you see over the Bible? Yeah, and also Persia's mentioned in that passage, which Persia was changed to Iran in 1935. Right. It became the Islamic Republic of Iran in the late 1970s. So here you have these nations mentioned and others as well there. Well, it's not very hard to envision those nations coming against Israel, what we see happening over there now. So a lot of the coalitions, the Bible speaks of in the end times are coming together just as the Scriptures predict. So there really are a lot of signs out there for us today that lead us to believe that the coming of Christ could be very soon. Practical application as a pastor, you're a theologian, you're a scholar, you spend a lot of time looking at the Bible through a prophetic lens. How can we as Christ followers best prepare is there a occupy until I come? Is there an aggressiveness or do we just, are we passive and just wait? What do we do? You know, back in the book of Hebrews, it says, don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together as the manner of some has been encouraged one another. And then it says, and do it all the more as you see the day drawing near. Now that must mean we can see the day drawing near. That really would make any sense. And so I think what that's telling us is, is we see the day drawing near. We ought to ratchet up our own spiritual lives, the intensity of it, the urgency. Every place that the coming of Christ is mentioned in the New Testament that I can think of, there's always practical application. And first Thessalonians four, some believers have died and he tells them about the rapture and he says, comfort one another with these words. And first, first Corinthians 15, he talks all about the rapture and he says, therefore, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord knowing your labor is not in vain. John 14, Jesus said, don't let your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me, in my Father's house or many dwelling places. But we're not so I would have told you, I go to prepare a place for you by going prepare a place for you. I will come again and receive you unto myself where I am there you may be also. So it's a comforting word. And then the last one I love is in 1 John chapter 3 where John says there in the passage, everyone who fixes his hope on him purifies himself, as he himself is pure. So the coming of the Lord is a purifying hope. So it's a purifying hope, it's a motivating hope, it's a comforting hope, it's a calming hope. Every place it's mentioned in the New Testament, there's always that application with it. And I can't think of anything more comforting in these days in which we live than to know that Jesus is coming back someday and he's going to deliver us from the coming right.",subjective

The Abraham Accords heralded the dawn of a new age of peace. But I believe that we are the cusp of an even more dramatic breakthrough, an historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Such a peace will go a long way to ending the Arab-Israeli conflict. It will encourage other Arab states to normalize their relations with Israel. It will enhance the prospects of peace with the Palestinians. It will encourage a broader reconciliation between Judaism and Islam, between Jerusalem and Mecca, between the descendants of Isaac and the descendants of Ishmael. All these are tremendous blessings. Two weeks ago, we saw another blessing already in sight. In the G20 conference, President Biden, by Minister Modi, and European and Arab leaders announced plans for a visionary corridor that will stretch across the Arabian Peninsula in Israel. It will connect India to Europe with maritime links, rail links, energy pipelines, fiber optic cables. This corridor will bypass maritime checkpoints or chokepoints rather, and dramatically lower the cost of goods, communication and energy for over 2 billion people. What a historic change for my country. You see, the land of Israel is situated in the crossroad between Africa, Asia and Europe. And for centuries, my country was repeatedly invaded by empires passing through it in their campaigns of plunder and conquest elsewhere. But today, as we tear down the walls of enmity, Israel can become a bridge of peace and prosperity between these continents. This between Israel and Saudi Arabia will truly create a new Middle East.",subjective

Can he do that, do you think? Why not? He considers himself head of state. He won the elections. Although we believe in Russia that the coup de temps is the primary source of power for everything that happened after 2014. And in this sense, even today, government is flawed. But he considers himself the president, then he is recognized by the United States, all of Europe, and practically the rest of the world in such a capacity. Why not? Can we negotiate it with Ukraine and Istanbul? We agreed. He was aware of this. He even put his preliminary signature on the document that I am telling you about. But then he publicly stated to the whole world we were ready to sign this document. But Mr. Johnson, then the prime minister of the region came and persuaded us from doing this, saying it was better to fight Russia. And we agreed with this proposal.

Now if you've never seen it before, on the right hand side is Yasser Adafat, the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, also known by the initialism the PLO. On the left is the Labour Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and in the middle is Bill Clinton, the then American president. What they effectively set in motion here was the Oslo I and Oslo II Accords. Now the photos from the Oslo I Accord, however this led to the Oslo II Accord. Now the second Oslo Accords was the significant one because it was the one that established area A, the area that would be under Palestinian civilian and security control, area B in the West Bank, this is where that would be placed under Palestinian control and Israeli security authority, and area C comprised 60% of the remaining West Bank that would be under full Israeli control. The other thing that the Oslo Accords gave the Palestinian people was the Palestinian authority or the PA. Now the PA is effectively a form of limited self-rule in the occupied territories for the Palestinian people, and the reason that this was so significant was because they were allowed for the first time to hold democratic elections and have a representative that Israel effectively respected. But the Oslo Accords were not what they seemed, they were not this significant moment with regards to a step towards peace for the Palestinian people. In reality, the PLO had betrayed the Palestinian people for their own interests, and also the Palestinian authority, this organization that was meant to give the Palestinian people some form of self-government is an organization that is largely benevolent to Israel and constitutes a new tool of colonial control over the West Bank because of the fact that the PA get all of their funding through Israel and Israel can choose to withhold it wherever it sees fit, meaning that the PA will do things like arrest Palestinian activists when Israel asks them to. But the Oslo Accords also harm the Palestinians for another reason, because the PLO accepted something called an interim agreement, and effectively what would be done according to Israel is that issues such as settlements, the right of return of refugees, what would be done with East Jerusalem amongst other things would be sorted within five years. We are now 30 years after the Oslo Accords were first signed, and nothing has seemingly changed, and it doesn't look like it will. In fact, the situation is worsened, and Israeli control over the West Bank is only growing. The reason the Arifat can be seen as betraying his people is because the Oslo Accords were not the only communications going on between the Israelis and the Palestinians at this time. The lead negotiators and the best negotiators from Palestine had actually been meeting the Israelis since 1992 and into 1993 in Madrid and Washington under an American-sponsored initiative in order to deal with the issues. These negotiators were much better, and they wouldn't let the issue of settlements carry on. They basically said that they would not negotiate with the Israelis with their hard-line position of effectively rejecting the idea of stopping settlements and ignoring the most important issues for them. Arifat was well aware that his influence was waning, his expulsion to Jordan and then to Lebanon and then to Tunisia had marginalized the PLO as a force. Islamic politics was growing within Gaza, and within the West Bank there was a new emerging leadership of young people founded from the Interfada. Arifat had also made the decision to support Saddam Hussein during the Gulf War, which had further damaged his and the PLO's legitimacy. So when this opportunity came up for him to talk to the Israelis directly and perhaps forge some kind of peace, he lapped at it and he was not able to avoid the pitfalls that the negotiators at Washington and Madrid had made well-sure to not agree to anything with Israel that would directly harm the Palestinian people. Joseph Mossad called the Oslo Accords the right for the Palestinian people to dispose of themselves. He effectively called it the end of the Palestinian chances and hopes for a state because ultimately what they accepted was Israel's right to colonize them. The PLO's behavior and Arifat's obsession with becoming a more significant figure led to the destruction of the hopes of a viable Palestinian state.",subjective

There are 700,000 settlers in the West Bank in East Jerusalem, and not an Israeli politician or movement in sight who is prepared to remove them. Quite the contrary, annexation exists at two speeds, creeping annexation tolerated by a broad spectrum of the Israeli political elite from the centre to the right, and annexation tomorrow as proposed by the National Religious Movement. This force is in the driving seat. So why does the international community continue to advocate for a two-state solution? When the Orslo Accords have essentially become unattainable? The short answer is that while Oslo is a path to peace is clearly dead, as a formula for maintaining the occupation, Oslo is alive and well. Just think for a moment, what would happen if Oslo were abandoned? The Palestinian President would resign and call elections. Those elections would be free and fair. Neither Israel nor Washington could cast a veto over the process or the outcome. Fatter would probably lose in the West Bank, but could win in Gaza. It would soon become clear that the best hope of all the Palestinian factions would be to form a government of national unity. But Palestinians would actually have a leadership, they elected. Not only would the PAB reinvigorate it, but so too would all the other bodies whose life has been sucked out of them. The PNC and the PLO. The new Palestinian leadership would stop security cooperation with Israel, which is a euphemism for letting soldiers undercover squads roam all over the territory that they control. The forces under the PAs control could then come face to face with Israeli soldiers and settlers, especially if the PAA did its job and actually defended Arab towns from settler attacks. Israel would have to start treating the PAA with respect. Not simply as another arm of occupation. If Oslo were abandoned, the international community couldn't threaten to cut off PAA funds because they would be damaging the formation of a Palestinian state, which they then would have to recognize. Now, do you seriously see all that happening? I for one don't. And that's the answer to the question of why a two-state solution still lives on in the bosom of every government in Europe, and the US and around the world. But let us be clear. Oslo exists today not as a peace process. That can only come when the occupation becomes too costly for the occupiers. Only then will they start to negotiate. When that happens, there can only be one solution. One state for all its peoples with equal rights, only then will the occupation, the nightmare of occupation be over.",subjective

Yet 30 years later peace seems like a distant... Ladies and gentlemen, we kindly ask that you remain seated during a document signing. The first of the Oslo Accords was signed on 13th September 1993. It should have marked the beginning of the end to the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. We have been granted the great privilege of witnessing this victory for peace. Just as the Jewish people this week celebrate the dawn of a new year, let us all go from this place to celebrate the dawn of a new era. After a year of secret meetings in the Norwegian capital Oslo, after which the Accords were named, a plan was established for Israel to withdraw from parts in the West Bank and Gaza. Persons were also made to transfer governing duties to a Palestinian interim government, which later resulted in the creation of the Palestinian Authority. Occupy Palestine was divided in three areas. A. Under full Palestinian control. B. Civil control and Israel and Palestine would have joined security control. And C. would be under control of Israel except over Palestinians. Both parties were given five years to follow up on the plan. Afterwards, negotiations were set to reach permanent decisions on unresolved issues. A year after signing the Oslo Accords, the noble peace prize was awarded to former Palestinian Authority President Yasir Hadafant. Former Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Perez and former Prime Minister of Israel Yitzhak Rabin for their efforts to create peace in the Middle East. However, the Oslo Peace process quickly entered a cycle of failed negotiations until it ultimately collapsed during the 2000 Camp David summit and the second in Tifago. Afterwards, attempts were made to restart negotiations towards a two-state solution, but they never resulted into conclusive agreements. 30 years later, Palestine is still illegally occupied by Israel and Israeli settlers frequently construct new settlements in occupied Palestine under protection of the Israeli army. In 2019, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said he would suspend all agreements with Israel after a demolished dozens of Palestinian homes on the outskirts of occupied East Jerusalem. Although Abbas made his threats before without implementing them, in 2020, he also said he would end security agreements with the United States and Israel. In 2022, was the deadliest year for the West Bank since the second in Tifago. It is painfully clear that the prospect of creating a Palestinian state alongside one that defines itself as Jewish is zero.

My name is Suzy Amalner. I'm the executive director of Bayou-Beyond and I have been working with Palestinian refugees for 19 years. In September 1995, Rubin and Erafat signed the second Oslo Accords in Washington, DC, which really was just an agreement coming out of more negotiations. Oslo II was supposed to provide Palestinians with self-rule in parts of the West Bank. That's important and also provide a framework for Palestinian elections. What Oslo II did do is chop up the West Bank into three areas, area A, area B, and area C. So I want to break this down as concisely as I can. Let's go over area A is in the red. Area A is about 18 percent of the West Bank and it is under political and military control from the Palestinians. It includes major cities like Ramallah, Bethlehem, Neblus, Janine Jericho, and some of Hebron. There are no illegal settlements in area A, apart from Hebron because there are now Israeli citizens are not allowed to go to area A. And since the early 2000s, Israeli armed forces have been raiding refugee camps, cities in area A on a regular basis mostly at night. Even though Palestinians are free in area A, they have to go through Israeli checkpoints. Do you see how all the red areas are like little islands and they're effectively cut off from each other? Even visiting another village or town, they have to go through Israeli checkpoints or to leave their country. And Palestinians do not have their own airport or seaport. Area B in the pink makes up for about 22 percent of the West Bank. It is under Palestinian sub-a-law and sharing military responsibilities with Israel, but in reality Israel holds all the military control over this area. This area is agricultural land and holds about 440 Palestinian villages. Now there are reports of Israeli settlers violating the Oslo Accords and spreading into area B by seizing private Palestinian land for settlement. Now notice the Palestinian authority in the red and the pink and how they're like islands. They're effectively cut off from each other separated by area C, which is Israeli control. Area C in the white is completely under Israeli control. You have 300,000 Palestinians in 500 and some residential areas in area C. In 1972 you had 1000 illegal Israeli settlers in area C as of 2023. There are half million. And here's what's really important. 70 percent of Palestinian communities in area C do not have access to the water network. They must rely on bottle water, trucked in, and over 100,000 of them live on less than 95 liters of water a day, which is half the minimum amount recommended by the World Health Organization. And nearly half of the Palestinian communities in area C report problems accessing health care, emergency, and basic because of long distances and checkpoints.

So in several states of the movie, we can see maps on the negotiating table. But the question is, would there have been maps there at all? Maybe not. In 2004 report, History Professor Hilda Hendrixen-Wolga writes about the later 1995 negotiations, saying, Israeli negotiators decided to keep things in the air. They would not show the Palestinians any maps until the end of the negotiations. Israeli negotiators believed that the Palestinians would yield more easily on security than on territory, while Israel would never give them on security. And Palestinian Abu Al-Ala was pretty clear on that. Land was crucial for the Palestinians. His exact words to Eris Avir were, on land, we will not yield. So it makes sense that strategically the Israelis would not want to have maps at all. So while Ahmed Karai, Hassan Asfur and Eris Avir would have been talking, we're not sure whether maps would have been present in 1993. And we do know that by 1995 maps were out of the picture.",subjective

The Oslo Accords are an agreement between the illegal state of Israel and the PLO, where the PLO would recognize the state of Israel and in return, Israel would recognize the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people. The Oslo Accords were split into two parts. Part 1 was signed in 1993 in Washington, DC, and Part 2 was signed in Egypt in 1995. Oslo One promise is really withdrawal from occupied territories and limited self-governance by the Palestinian Authority. Oslo Two detailed the Palestinian election process, reduced hostilities and expansion of Palestinian self-rule. Mind you, the self-rule by the Palestinian Authority was only 3% of the West Bank. 24% of the West Bank was to be Palestinian Authority Civil and a joint Israeli Palestinian security control. 73% of the West Bank was to be fully under the control of Israel. Now at this time, the Oslo Accords were only about the locals of the time. It was not about Palestinian refugees, the ready return, or some of the most serious issues. So why did it fail?

But behind the photo op, a much more sinister picture was playing out on the ground. I think Edward Sides said it best when he described the also records as a Palestinian Versailles in other words, complete capitulation. Created to solve the so-called Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Oslo Accords were meant to kick off a five-year process that would end with peace in the region, and an independent Palestinian state.

Now if you've never seen it before, on the right hand side is Yasser Adafat, the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, also known by the initialism the PLO. On the left is the Labour Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and in the middle is Bill Clinton, the then American president. What they effectively set in motion here was the Oslo I and Oslo II Accords. Now the photos from the Oslo I Accord, however this led to the Oslo II Accord. Now the second Oslo Accords was the significant one because it was the one that established area A, the area that would be under Palestinian civilian and security control, area B in the West Bank, this is where that would be placed under Palestinian control and Israeli security authority, and area C comprised 60% of the remaining West Bank that would be under full Israeli control. The other thing that the Oslo Accords gave the Palestinian people was the Palestinian authority or the PA. Now the PA is effectively a form of limited self-rule in the occupied territories for the Palestinian people, and the reason that this was so significant was because they were allowed for the first time to hold democratic elections and have a representative that Israel effectively respected. But the Oslo Accords were not what they seemed, they were not this significant moment with regards to a step towards peace for the Palestinian people. In reality, the PLO had betrayed the Palestinian people for their own interests, and also the Palestinian authority, this organization that was meant to give the Palestinian people some form of self-government is an organization that is largely benevolent to Israel and constitutes a new tool of colonial control over the West Bank because of the fact that the PA get all of their funding through Israel and Israel can choose to withhold it wherever it sees fit, meaning that the PA will do things like arrest Palestinian activists when Israel asks them to. But the Oslo Accords also harm the Palestinians for another reason, because the PLO accepted something called an interim agreement, and effectively what would be done according to Israel is that issues such as settlements, the right of return of refugees, what would be done with East Jerusalem amongst other things would be sorted within five years. We are now 30 years after the Oslo Accords were first signed, and nothing has seemingly changed, and it doesn't look like it will. In fact, the situation is worsened, and Israeli control over the West Bank is only growing. The reason the Arifat can be seen as betraying his people is because the Oslo Accords were not the only communications going on between the Israelis and the Palestinians at this time. The lead negotiators and the best negotiators from Palestine had actually been meeting the Israelis since 1992 and into 1993 in Madrid and Washington under an American-sponsored initiative in order to deal with the issues. These negotiators were much better, and they wouldn't let the issue of settlements carry on. They basically said that they would not negotiate with the Israelis with their hard-line position of effectively rejecting the idea of stopping settlements and ignoring the most important issues for them. Arifat was well aware that his influence was waning, his expulsion to Jordan and then to Lebanon and then to Tunisia had marginalized the PLO as a force. Islamic politics was growing within Gaza, and within the West Bank there was a new emerging leadership of young people founded from the Interfada. Arifat had also made the decision to support Saddam Hussein during the Gulf War, which had further damaged his and the PLO's legitimacy. So when this opportunity came up for him to talk to the Israelis directly and perhaps forge some kind of peace, he lapped at it and he was not able to avoid the pitfalls that the negotiators at Washington and Madrid had made well-sure to not agree to anything with Israel that would directly harm the Palestinian people. Joseph Mossad called the Oslo Accords the right for the Palestinian people to dispose of themselves. He effectively called it the end of the Palestinian chances and hopes for a state because ultimately what they accepted was Israel's right to colonize them. The PLO's behavior and Arifat's obsession with becoming a more significant figure led to the destruction of the hopes of a viable Palestinian state.",subjective

There are 700,000 settlers in the West Bank in East Jerusalem, and not an Israeli politician or movement in sight who is prepared to remove them. Quite the contrary, annexation exists at two speeds, creeping annexation tolerated by a broad spectrum of the Israeli political elite from the centre to the right, and annexation tomorrow as proposed by the National Religious Movement. This force is in the driving seat. So why does the international community continue to advocate for a two-state solution? When the Orslo Accords have essentially become unattainable? The short answer is that while Oslo is a path to peace is clearly dead, as a formula for maintaining the occupation, Oslo is alive and well. Just think for a moment, what would happen if Oslo were abandoned? The Palestinian President would resign and call elections. Those elections would be free and fair. Neither Israel nor Washington could cast a veto over the process or the outcome. Fatter would probably lose in the West Bank, but could win in Gaza. It would soon become clear that the best hope of all the Palestinian factions would be to form a government of national unity. But Palestinians would actually have a leadership, they elected. Not only would the PAB reinvigorate it, but so too would all the other bodies whose life has been sucked out of them. The PNC and the PLO. The new Palestinian leadership would stop security cooperation with Israel, which is a euphemism for letting soldiers undercover squads roam all over the territory that they control. The forces under the PAs control could then come face to face with Israeli soldiers and settlers, especially if the PAA did its job and actually defended Arab towns from settler attacks. Israel would have to start treating the PAA with respect. Not simply as another arm of occupation. If Oslo were abandoned, the international community couldn't threaten to cut off PAA funds because they would be damaging the formation of a Palestinian state, which they then would have to recognize. Now, do you seriously see all that happening? I for one don't. And that's the answer to the question of why a two-state solution still lives on in the bosom of every government in Europe, and the US and around the world. But let us be clear. Oslo exists today not as a peace process. That can only come when the occupation becomes too costly for the occupiers. Only then will they start to negotiate. When that happens, there can only be one solution. One state for all its peoples with equal rights, only then will the occupation, the nightmare of occupation be over.",subjective

Yet 30 years later peace seems like a distant... Ladies and gentlemen, we kindly ask that you remain seated during a document signing. The first of the Oslo Accords was signed on 13th September 1993. It should have marked the beginning of the end to the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. We have been granted the great privilege of witnessing this victory for peace. Just as the Jewish people this week celebrate the dawn of a new year, let us all go from this place to celebrate the dawn of a new era. After a year of secret meetings in the Norwegian capital Oslo, after which the Accords were named, a plan was established for Israel to withdraw from parts in the West Bank and Gaza. Persons were also made to transfer governing duties to a Palestinian interim government, which later resulted in the creation of the Palestinian Authority. Occupy Palestine was divided in three areas. A. Under full Palestinian control. B. Civil control and Israel and Palestine would have joined security control. And C. would be under control of Israel except over Palestinians. Both parties were given five years to follow up on the plan. Afterwards, negotiations were set to reach permanent decisions on unresolved issues. A year after signing the Oslo Accords, the noble peace prize was awarded to former Palestinian Authority President Yasir Hadafant. Former Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Perez and former Prime Minister of Israel Yitzhak Rabin for their efforts to create peace in the Middle East. However, the Oslo Peace process quickly entered a cycle of failed negotiations until it ultimately collapsed during the 2000 Camp David summit and the second in Tifago. Afterwards, attempts were made to restart negotiations towards a two-state solution, but they never resulted into conclusive agreements. 30 years later, Palestine is still illegally occupied by Israel and Israeli settlers frequently construct new settlements in occupied Palestine under protection of the Israeli army. In 2019, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said he would suspend all agreements with Israel after a demolished dozens of Palestinian homes on the outskirts of occupied East Jerusalem. Although Abbas made his threats before without implementing them, in 2020, he also said he would end security agreements with the United States and Israel.

My name is Suzy Amalner. I'm the executive director of Bayou-Beyond and I have been working with Palestinian refugees for 19 years. In September 1995, Rubin and Erafat signed the second Oslo Accords in Washington, DC, which really was just an agreement coming out of more negotiations. Oslo II was supposed to provide Palestinians with self-rule in parts of the West Bank. That's important and also provide a framework for Palestinian elections. What Oslo II did do is chop up the West Bank into three areas, area A, area B, and area C. So I want to break this down as concisely as I can. Let's go over area A is in the red. Area A is about 18 percent of the West Bank and it is under political and military control from the Palestinians. It includes major cities like Ramallah, Bethlehem, Neblus, Janine Jericho, and some of Hebron. There are no illegal settlements in area A, apart from Hebron because there are now Israeli citizens are not allowed to go to area A. And since the early 2000s, Israeli armed forces have been raiding refugee camps, cities in area A on a regular basis mostly at night. Even though Palestinians are free in area A, they have to go through Israeli checkpoints. Do you see how all the red areas are like little islands and they're effectively cut off from each other? Even visiting another village or town, they have to go through Israeli checkpoints or to leave their country. And Palestinians do not have their own airport or seaport. Area B in the pink makes up for about 22 percent of the West Bank. It is under Palestinian sub-a-law and sharing military responsibilities with Israel, but in reality Israel holds all the military control over this area. This area is agricultural land and holds about 440 Palestinian villages. Now there are reports of Israeli settlers violating the Oslo Accords and spreading into area B by seizing private Palestinian land for settlement. Now notice the Palestinian authority in the red and the pink and how they're like islands. They're effectively cut off from each other separated by area C, which is Israeli control. Area C in the white is completely under Israeli control. You have 300,000 Palestinians in 500 and some residential areas in area C. In 1972 you had 1000 illegal Israeli settlers in area C as of 2023. There are half million. And here's what's really important. 70 percent of Palestinian communities in area C do not have access to the water network. They must rely on bottle water, trucked in, and over 100,000 of them live on less than 95 liters of water a day, which is half the minimum amount recommended by the World Health Organization. And nearly half of the Palestinian communities in area C report problems accessing health care, emergency, and basic because of long distances and checkpoints.

It was the handshake of the century. A handshake that symbolized the end, or at least the beginning of the end, of a decade's long conflict. We bid them Shalom. Shalom. Peace. But behind the photo op, a much more sinister picture was playing out on the ground. I think Edward Sides said it best when he described the also records as a Palestinian Versailles in other words, complete capitulation. Created to solve the so-called Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Oslo Accords were meant to kick off a five-year process that would end with peace in the region, and an independent Palestinian state. But now, 30 years later, the reality on the ground bears little resemblance to what was promised. I belong to a generation that has lived its entire life under this Oslo framework, which has a facade of a framework that has both nothing but increased Israeli oppression and violence. We all have a great relationship. We all have a great deal of power, all of our efforts, all of our efforts, all of our efforts, but it's very important when it don't. When it actually jubing it like that is the most important thing. Many critics of the Accords say that the Oslo process was actually set up to fail. Do you agree with that characterization? No, no.

Before October, fishermen in Gaza were only allowed to fish 15 nautical miles out. Before and after October, Israeli forces have targeted these fishermen. In 2017, 25-year-old Muhammad Becker was fishing with his two brothers when he was shot and killed by these Israeli navy. In 2021, three Palestinian fishermen were killed when an Israeli drone blew up on their fishing net. Israeli forces killed six Palestinian fishermen in 2005.

By January of this year, Israel had destroyed 70% of us as fishing boats. February 24, 2024, Israeli forces opened fire on a Palestinian fisherman's boat off the coast of Hanunis. By October of 2023, Israel bombed the Gaza port. They've been shot and bombed while trying to fish. You know, trying to feed their families while there's a forced ourvation. And I want to know, even pre-October, Israeli forces often didn't allow Palestinians to even go the full 15 nautical miles out. They would often make them turn around at three nautical miles out. In the early 2000s, Israeli forces made Palestinian fishermen undress and swim naked for a couple miles out just to humiliate them. They have been targeting Palestinian fishermen for over 20 years. You might be asking yourself, why are they doing that? They're an occupying force. That is what they do. Occupy, terrorize, humiliate, torture, kill.

There was supposed to be settled later. By 1999, there was an extremist group on both sides that didn't want peace. So they resorted to violence to stop the peace process. But in 1995, this Israeli prime minister, who was more willing to negotiate with the Palestinians for peace, was assassinated by a Jewish extremist. Later, BB Netanyahu became prime minister and ruined a few things. This group didn't want the Oslo court to go through. So they increased terrorism against the Israelis.

No hate to that creator at all, but it's actually so much worse than what that creator said about the Oslo Accords. Because Yitzhak Rabin did not want to give the watermelon people autonomy at all. The Oslo Accords were basically the means of legitimizing the PA or the Watermelon Authority as a police force to be used by the blue and white to police the watermelon people, right? Okay, so in the book that I'm reading, the 100 Years War on Palestine Cybersheet Colleity, the author says what the negotiators, what the watermelon negotiators for the Oslo Accords had signed onto was a highly restricted form of self-rule in a fragment of the occupied territories and without control of land, water, borders, or much else. In these and subsequent, subsequent accords based on them, in force until the present day with minor modifications, blue and white, state retained all such forogatives, indeed, amounting to virtually complete control over land and people together with most of the attributes of sovereignty. It also says what Rabin had done was something no other blue and white leader had ever done by formally conceding that there was a watermelon people accepting the PLO as their representative and opening negotiations with it, obtaining a return its recognition of the state of blue and white. This exchange was neither symmetrical nor reciprocal. Blue and white had not recognized a watermelon state or even made a commitment to allow the creation of one. This was a peculiar transaction whereby a national liberation movement had obtained nominal recognition from its oppressors without achieving liberation by trading its own recognition of the state that had colonized its homeland and continued to occupy it. Rabin also in October of 1995, less than a month before he was, he told the Kineset that any watermelon entity to be created would be less than a state. Rabin had also been defense minister before he was prime minister. So what this means is that Rabin who to us, like to the watermelon cause, the Oslo Accords actually hurt more than they helped. The situation in the West Bank got actively worse with more checkpoints and roadblocks after the Oslo Accords because of the Oslo Accords. It's so crazy because it actively made life worse for the watermelon people and made a watermelon state less attainable but even acknowledging the watermelon people existed was to left wing for the right wing and to the blue and white Z people. So they, Rabin, but he did so much damage with the Oslo Accords but they still, him, because they considered even that to left leaning because he dared to even say that the watermelon people even existed. So that is how far right that country is. So yeah, also Netanyahu and his buddy, Ben Itamar Ben-Gavir, who I think is like defense minister, he's on the cabinet of the, of Netanyahu's government. He like, Rabin's wife directly blames Netanyahu for her husband's, that thing and also Ben-Gavir, may or may not have been directly involved because he was like a member of the group that the, on a livery was a member of like they were buddies, they knew each other and they ran in the same political circles. So it's way worse, it's actually worse than that. And I'm not laughing because it's funny, I'm laughing because if I didn't laugh I was our crime. So",subjective

Oslo 2 was signed in September 28th 1995, but less than two months later on November 4th, right at the end of a rally in Tel Aviv that was in support of the Oslo Accords, a Jewish extremist assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Rabin, who was the man that facilitated the Oslo agreements. Rabin was then replaced by the Kud member and current Prime Minister, terrorist and child murderer, BB Netanyahu. BB was always an outspoken critic of the Oslo Accords, and just recently he was quoted that he takes pride in being the man that prevented the creation of a Palestinian state. Soon after Netanyahu took power, Saddamer expansion resumed and grew by over 52%. Settler population grew 117% in Gaza and 46% in the West Bank. In seven short years between 1993 and 2000, Settler population more than doubled in occupied territories. Tensions continued to grow and in September of 2000, Palestinian resistance declared the Second Antifada. So for any Zionist tell you that the Palestinians failed the Israelis during the Aslul years, remind them of the assassination of Rabin and the arrogance of Netanyahu.

In an assassination that shocked the Jewish world, Rabin was murdered. In the early 2000s, relentless violence from the second in Tafada eroded any hope for peace. But maybe there is hope.

My name is Suzanne Monner. I'm the executive director of Bayrouton Beyond and I have been working with Palestinian refugees for 19 years. Can you believe that it has been 30 years since the first Oslo Accords? Now the Oslo Accords were not a peace treaty. They were basically an agreement from the Palestinians and the Israelis to recognize each other's right to exist. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO, head of the PLO, and the spokesman for the Palestinian people, yes or air fat, signed the Accords. They were really, Oslo was really a declaration of principles, not a peace treaty, and it was trying to establish like an interim governance framework that could further facilitate further negotiations in the agreement. Oslo Accords were supposed to last until 1999, that's when they were supposed to be complete. So here's what happened with Oslo one in a nutshell. It effectively ended the first in Tafada. It also transferred Jericho and Ghazah back to Palestinians and Yasser Erifat after 30 years of exile returned to establish the Palestinian Authority. What Oslo didn't do was address the final issues. Israel took them off the table and that included the permanent borders of Palestine and Israel Jewish settlements, the right to return for Palestinian refugees and Jerusalem. A year later in 1994, Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Prime Minister, Israeli Foreign Minister at the time, Shimon Puraz, and Yasser Erifat won the Nobel Peace Prize for their participation in the Oslo Accords.

That's been the position. We bear no, they also accord, say specifically, that Israel bears no responsibility for the costs of the occupation. This after 20 years, 26 years of military occupation, no responsibility. As an Israeli journalist said, he said, we took over the country in 1948 from the British. The British left us the port of Haifa, a road system, an electrical system, a large number of municipal buildings and lots of prisons. And we could build Israel without that, there would be no state today. If we had taken Palestine in 1948, the way we left Gaza for the Palestinians, there would be no Israel. We destroyed the economy, we deported most of the capable people, we forced the people to live in hovels and refugee camps over a period. I mean, anybody's been to Gaza, it's one of the most criminal places on earth because of Israeli policy of occupation. And they bear no responsibility for it.

In the absence of a clear political framework for solving the conflict, Israeli-Pastinian normalization can focus on building trust between peoples. Two Interfadas and many failed negotiations later, the fear of normalization stems from the inability for each side to see the other as normal people. But imagine if community leaders could be motivated to function as a meaningful bridge between Israelis and Palestinians. The best way to do so is by supporting the type of cultural exchange that the Abraham Accords has done for Israelis and the Maraudis. Take language, for example. Some Palestinians speak Hebrew and a growing number of Israelis inspired by the Abraham Accords are learning Arabic. Students' language exchange is a great opportunity to build the type of interpersonal relationships that are the prerequisite for trust. Trust that can be the basis for changing Palestinian and Israeli lives for the better.",subjective

Now if you've never seen it before, on the right hand side is Yasser Adafat, the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, also known by the initialism the PLO. On the left is the Labour Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and in the middle is Bill Clinton, the then American president. What they effectively set in motion here was the Oslo I and Oslo II Accords. Now the photos from the Oslo I Accord, however this led to the Oslo II Accord. Now the second Oslo Accords was the significant one because it was the one that established area A, the area that would be under Palestinian civilian and security control, area B in the West Bank, this is where that would be placed under Palestinian control and Israeli security authority, and area C comprised 60% of the remaining West Bank that would be under full Israeli control. The other thing that the Oslo Accords gave the Palestinian people was the Palestinian authority or the PA. Now the PA is effectively a form of limited self-rule in the occupied territories for the Palestinian people, and the reason that this was so significant was because they were allowed for the first time to hold democratic elections and have a representative that Israel effectively respected. But the Oslo Accords were not what they seemed, they were not this significant moment with regards to a step towards peace for the Palestinian people. In reality, the PLO had betrayed the Palestinian people for their own interests, and also the Palestinian authority, this organization that was meant to give the Palestinian people some form of self-government is an organization that is largely benevolent to Israel and constitutes a new tool of colonial control over the West Bank because of the fact that the PA get all of their funding through Israel and Israel can choose to withhold it wherever it sees fit, meaning that the PA will do things like arrest Palestinian activists when Israel asks them to. But the Oslo Accords also harm the Palestinians for another reason, because the PLO accepted something called an interim agreement, and effectively what would be done according to Israel is that issues such as settlements, the right of return of refugees, what would be done with East Jerusalem amongst other things would be sorted within five years. We are now 30 years after the Oslo Accords were first signed, and nothing has seemingly changed, and it doesn't look like it will. In fact, the situation is worsened, and Israeli control over the West Bank is only growing. The reason the Arifat can be seen as betraying his people is because the Oslo Accords were not the only communications going on between the Israelis and the Palestinians at this time. The lead negotiators and the best negotiators from Palestine had actually been meeting the Israelis since 1992 and into 1993 in Madrid and Washington under an American-sponsored initiative in order to deal with the issues. These negotiators were much better, and they wouldn't let the issue of settlements carry on. They basically said that they would not negotiate with the Israelis with their hard-line position of effectively rejecting the idea of stopping settlements and ignoring the most important issues for them. Arifat was well aware that his influence was waning, his expulsion to Jordan and then to Lebanon and then to Tunisia had marginalized the PLO as a force. Islamic politics was growing within Gaza, and within the West Bank there was a new emerging leadership of young people founded from the Interfada. Arifat had also made the decision to support Saddam Hussein during the Gulf War, which had further damaged his and the PLO's legitimacy. So when this opportunity came up for him to talk to the Israelis directly and perhaps forge some kind of peace, he lapped at it and he was not able to avoid the pitfalls that the negotiators at Washington and Madrid had made well-sure to not agree to anything with Israel that would directly harm the Palestinian people. Joseph Mossad called the Oslo Accords the right for the Palestinian people to dispose of themselves. He effectively called it the end of the Palestinian chances and hopes for a state because ultimately what they accepted was Israel's right to colonize them. The PLO's behavior and Arifat's obsession with becoming a more significant figure led to the destruction of the hopes of a viable Palestinian state.",subjective

There are 700,000 settlers in the West Bank in East Jerusalem, and not an Israeli politician or movement in sight who is prepared to remove them. Quite the contrary, annexation exists at two speeds, creeping annexation tolerated by a broad spectrum of the Israeli political elite from the centre to the right, and annexation tomorrow as proposed by the National Religious Movement. This force is in the driving seat. So why does the international community continue to advocate for a two-state solution? When the Orslo Accords have essentially become unattainable? The short answer is that while Oslo is a path to peace is clearly dead, as a formula for maintaining the occupation, Oslo is alive and well. Just think for a moment, what would happen if Oslo were abandoned? The Palestinian President would resign and call elections. Those elections would be free and fair. Neither Israel nor Washington could cast a veto over the process or the outcome. Fatter would probably lose in the West Bank, but could win in Gaza. It would soon become clear that the best hope of all the Palestinian factions would be to form a government of national unity. But Palestinians would actually have a leadership, they elected. Not only would the PAB reinvigorate it, but so too would all the other bodies whose life has been sucked out of them. The PNC and the PLO. The new Palestinian leadership would stop security cooperation with Israel, which is a euphemism for letting soldiers undercover squads roam all over the territory that they control. The forces under the PAs control could then come face to face with Israeli soldiers and settlers, especially if the PAA did its job and actually defended Arab towns from settler attacks. Israel would have to start treating the PAA with respect. Not simply as another arm of occupation. If Oslo were abandoned, the international community couldn't threaten to cut off PAA funds because they would be damaging the formation of a Palestinian state, which they then would have to recognize. Now, do you seriously see all that happening? I for one don't. And that's the answer to the question of why a two-state solution still lives on in the bosom of every government in Europe, and the US and around the world. But let us be clear. Oslo exists today not as a peace process. That can only come when the occupation becomes too costly for the occupiers. Only then will they start to negotiate. When that happens, there can only be one solution. One state for all its peoples with equal rights, only then will the occupation, the nightmare of occupation be over.",subjective

Yet 30 years later peace seems like a distant... Ladies and gentlemen, we kindly ask that you remain seated during a document signing. The first of the Oslo Accords was signed on 13th September 1993. It should have marked the beginning of the end to the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. We have been granted the great privilege of witnessing this victory for peace. Just as the Jewish people this week celebrate the dawn of a new year, let us all go from this place to celebrate the dawn of a new era. After a year of secret meetings in the Norwegian capital Oslo, after which the Accords were named, a plan was established for Israel to withdraw from parts in the West Bank and Gaza. Persons were also made to transfer governing duties to a Palestinian interim government, which later resulted in the creation of the Palestinian Authority. Occupy Palestine was divided in three areas. A. Under full Palestinian control. B. Civil control and Israel and Palestine would have joined security control. And C. would be under control of Israel except over Palestinians. Both parties were given five years to follow up on the plan. Afterwards, negotiations were set to reach permanent decisions on unresolved issues. A year after signing the Oslo Accords, the noble peace prize was awarded to former Palestinian Authority President Yasir Hadafant. Former Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Perez and former Prime Minister of Israel Yitzhak Rabin for their efforts to create peace in the Middle East. However, the Oslo Peace process quickly entered a cycle of failed negotiations until it ultimately collapsed during the 2000 Camp David summit and the second in Tifago. Afterwards, attempts were made to restart negotiations towards a two-state solution, but they never resulted into conclusive agreements. 30 years later, Palestine is still illegally occupied by Israel and Israeli settlers frequently construct new settlements in occupied Palestine under protection of the Israeli army. In 2019, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said he would suspend all agreements with Israel after a demolished dozens of Palestinian homes on the outskirts of occupied East Jerusalem. Although Abbas made his threats before without implementing them, in 2020, he also said he would end security agreements with the United States and Israel. In 2022, was the deadliest year for the West Bank since the second in Tifago. It is painfully clear that the prospect of creating a Palestinian state alongside one that defines itself as Jewish is zero.

My name is Suzy Amalner. I'm the executive director of Bayou-Beyond and I have been working with Palestinian refugees for 19 years. In September 1995, Rubin and Erafat signed the second Oslo Accords in Washington, DC, which really was just an agreement coming out of more negotiations. Oslo II was supposed to provide Palestinians with self-rule in parts of the West Bank. That's important and also provide a framework for Palestinian elections. What Oslo II did do is chop up the West Bank into three areas, area A, area B, and area C. So I want to break this down as concisely as I can. Let's go over area A is in the red. Area A is about 18 percent of the West Bank and it is under political and military control from the Palestinians. It includes major cities like Ramallah, Bethlehem, Neblus, Janine Jericho, and some of Hebron. There are no illegal settlements in area A, apart from Hebron because there are now Israeli citizens are not allowed to go to area A. And since the early 2000s, Israeli armed forces have been raiding refugee camps, cities in area A on a regular basis mostly at night. Even though Palestinians are free in area A, they have to go through Israeli checkpoints. Do you see how all the red areas are like little islands and they're effectively cut off from each other? Even visiting another village or town, they have to go through Israeli checkpoints or to leave their country. And Palestinians do not have their own airport or seaport. Area B in the pink makes up for about 22 percent of the West Bank. It is under Palestinian sub-a-law and sharing military responsibilities with Israel, but in reality Israel holds all the military control over this area. This area is agricultural land and holds about 440 Palestinian villages. Now there are reports of Israeli settlers violating the Oslo Accords and spreading into area B by seizing private Palestinian land for settlement. Now notice the Palestinian authority in the red and the pink and how they're like islands. They're effectively cut off from each other separated by area C, which is Israeli control. Area C in the white is completely under Israeli control. You have 300,000 Palestinians in 500 and some residential areas in area C. In 1972 you had 1000 illegal Israeli settlers in area C as of 2023. There are half million. And here's what's really important. 70 percent of Palestinian communities in area C do not have access to the water network. They must rely on bottle water, trucked in, and over 100,000 of them live on less than 95 liters of water a day, which is half the minimum amount recommended by the World Health Organization. And nearly half of the Palestinian communities in area C report problems accessing health care, emergency, and basic because of long distances and checkpoints.

In 2004 report, History Professor Hilda Hendrixen-Wolga writes about the later 1995 negotiations, saying, Israeli negotiators decided to keep things in the air. They would not show the Palestinians any maps until the end of the negotiations. Israeli negotiators believed that the Palestinians would yield more easily on security than on territory, while Israel would never give them on security. And Palestinian Abu Al-Ala was pretty clear on that. Land was crucial for the Palestinians. His exact words to Eris Avir were, on land, we will not yield. So it makes sense that strategically the Israelis would not want to have maps at all.

No hate to that creator at all, but it's actually so much worse than what that creator said about the Oslo Accords. Because Yitzhak Rabin did not want to give the watermelon people autonomy at all. The Oslo Accords were basically the means of legitimizing the PA or the Watermelon Authority as a police force to be used by the blue and white to police the watermelon people, right? Okay, so in the book that I'm reading, the 100 Years War on Palestine Cybersheet Colleity, the author says what the negotiators, what the watermelon negotiators for the Oslo Accords had signed onto was a highly restricted form of self-rule in a fragment of the occupied territories and without control of land, water, borders, or much else. In these and subsequent, subsequent accords based on them, in force until the present day with minor modifications, blue and white, state retained all such forogatives, indeed, amounting to virtually complete control over land and people together with most of the attributes of sovereignty. It also says what Rabin had done was something no other blue and white leader had ever done by formally conceding that there was a watermelon people accepting the PLO as their representative and opening negotiations with it, obtaining a return its recognition of the state of blue and white. This exchange was neither symmetrical nor reciprocal. Blue and white had not recognized a watermelon state or even made a commitment to allow the creation of one. This was a peculiar transaction whereby a national liberation movement had obtained nominal recognition from its oppressors without achieving liberation by trading its own recognition of the state that had colonized its homeland and continued to occupy it. Rabin also in October of 1995, less than a month before he was, he told the Kineset that any watermelon entity to be created would be less than a state. Rabin had also been defense minister before he was prime minister. So what this means is that Rabin who to us, like to the watermelon cause, the Oslo Accords actually hurt more than they helped. The situation in the West Bank got actively worse with more checkpoints and roadblocks after the Oslo Accords because of the Oslo Accords. It's so crazy because it actively made life worse for the watermelon people and made a watermelon state less attainable but even acknowledging the watermelon people existed was to left wing for the right wing and to the blue and white Z people. So they, Rabin, but he did so much damage with the Oslo Accords but they still, him, because they considered even that to left leaning because he dared to even say that the watermelon people even existed. So that is how far right that country is. So yeah, also Netanyahu and his buddy, Ben Itamar Ben-Gavir, who I think is like defense minister, he's on the cabinet of the, of Netanyahu's government.

You understand that this call for intifada is to commit genocide against the Jewish people. Before we break it down, let's get one thing straight. Intifada is not a call for the genocide of the Jewish people and anyone who tells you that is lying to you. Intifada is an Arabic word that literally means to shake off. For Palestinians, it signifies uprising and revolution, a shaking off of oppression. Some Palestinian intifadas or uprisings have taken both nonviolent and violent paths towards resisting Israeli-seller colonialism and occupation. The first intifada erupted in the late 1980s as a nonviolent form of collective disobedience with an emphasis on strikes and boycotts as a way of resisting Israeli oppression. In response, Israel cracked down on the protests, criminalizing and closing down universities and implementing its breaking the bone strategy. Ironically, despite Palestinian nonviolent protests, their oppression intensified. In 2000, the second intifada erupted after years of a stalled peace process and rapidly increasing settlement expansion on Palestinian land. Unlike its predecessor, the second intifada did involve violence and was marked by suicide bombings and young Palestinians taking up arms against their oppressors. It's important to clarify that unlike what many people are saying, these acts of violence didn't take place simply because of some deep-seated hatred towards Jews. They happened because after years of violent repression by the Israeli state against Palestinians that went unchanged by peaceful protests and political negotiations, many saw no other option than to meet state violence with violence. Of course, it's not in the best interest of Zionists, the Israeli lobby and the politicians that they fund to properly contextualize terms like intifada because if they did, then you would spend less time worrying about a genocidal chant and more time worrying about an actual genocide that's taking place right now.",subjective

So let's talk about the origins of Intifada. Intifada directly translates to Shake Off. Now the first Intifada which started in 1987 erupted after an Israeli truck ramped through a line of Palestinian workers just trying to get to Krasnah. This Intifada consisted of peaceful protests, boycotts of Israeli taxes, boycotts of all Israeli goods, essentially to shake off the Israeli systematic and economic oppression. During these protests, thousands of Palestinians were detained without charges, were deported, were even subjected to torture, and some were even assassinated. Now in 2000, Ariel Sharan and Israeli Prime Minister took a thousand Israeli troops and took a little day trip to Jerusalem. Now that also included going to an oxamoss which is a third-holious site in Islam. Now an oxamoss is an extremely important historical landmark for not just Palestinian Muslims but for also all Palestinians. So many of them took his little trip to Luxa as an attempt to take over. This then led to clashes between Palestinian protesters in the I.O.F. These clashes then led to an armed uprising in occupied Palestinian territories which then led Israel to go reoccupy those territories that were already being governed by the PA. And then came the glorious wall that separates Israel from the illegally occupied Palestinian territories. So upsetting is instead of focusing in on all the atrocities that Israel has committed in, you know, since 1948 or let's just say since 1987, the U.S. and Europe are instead just focusing in on the word anti-falda and anti-falda revolution. They're trying to convince the general public that this means death to all Jews, death to all Israelis. But instead it is a form of uprising against the illegal occupation that Palestinians have been living under since 1948. So remember there is only one way for Palestinians to gain liberation and that is through an anti-falda revolution.",subjective

Long live the intifada. Intifada. Intifada revolution. There seems to be a lot of confusion about what this term does mean and what it doesn't mean. You understand that this call for intifada is to commit genocide against the Jewish people. Before we break it down, let's get one thing straight. Intifada is not a call for the genocide of the Jewish people and anyone who tells you that is lying to you. Intifada is an Arabic word that literally means to shake off. For Palestinians, it signifies uprising and revolution, a shaking off of oppression. Some Palestinian intifadas or uprisings have taken both nonviolent and violent paths towards resisting Israeli-seller colonialism and occupation. The first intifada erupted in the late 1980s as a nonviolent form of collective disobedience with an emphasis on strikes and boycotts as a way of resisting Israeli oppression. In response, Israel cracked down on the protests, criminalizing and closing down universities and implementing its breaking the bone strategy. Ironically, despite Palestinian nonviolent protests, their oppression intensified. In 2000, the second intifada erupted after years of a stalled peace process and rapidly increasing settlement expansion on Palestinian land. Unlike its predecessor, the second intifada did involve violence and was marked by suicide bombings and young Palestinians taking up arms against their oppressors. It's important to clarify that unlike what many people are saying, these acts of violence didn't take place simply because of some deep-seated hatred towards Jews. They happened because after years of violent repression by the Israeli state against Palestinians that went unchanged by peaceful protests and political negotiations, many saw no other option than to meet state violence with violence. Of course, it's not in the best interest of Zionists, the Israeli lobby and the politicians that they fund to properly contextualize terms like intifada because if they did, then you would spend less time worrying about a genocidal chant and more time worrying about an actual genocide that's taking place right now.",subjective

So let's talk about the origins of Intifada. Intifada directly translates to Shake Off. Now the first Intifada which started in 1987 erupted after an Israeli truck ramped through a line of Palestinian workers just trying to get to Krasnah. This Intifada consisted of peaceful protests, boycotts of Israeli taxes, boycotts of all Israeli goods, essentially to shake off the Israeli systematic and economic oppression. During these protests, thousands of Palestinians were detained without charges, were deported, were even subjected to torture, and some were even assassinated. Now in 2000, Ariel Sharan and Israeli Prime Minister took a thousand Israeli troops and took a little day trip to Jerusalem. Now that also included going to an oxamoss which is a third-holious site in Islam. Now an oxamoss is an extremely important historical landmark for not just Palestinian Muslims but for also all Palestinians. So many of them took his little trip to Luxa as an attempt to take over. This then led to clashes between Palestinian protesters in the I.O.F. These clashes then led to an armed uprising in occupied Palestinian territories which then led Israel to go reoccupy those territories that were already being governed by the PA. And then came the glorious wall that separates Israel from the illegally occupied Palestinian territories. So upsetting is instead of focusing in on all the atrocities that Israel has committed in, you know, since 1948 or let's just say since 1987, the U.S. and Europe are instead just focusing in on the word anti-falda and anti-falda revolution. They're trying to convince the general public that this means death to all Jews, death to all Israelis. But instead it is a form of uprising against the illegal occupation that Palestinians have been living under since 1948. So remember there is only one way for Palestinians to gain liberation and that is through an anti-falda revolution.",subjective

Intifada is an Arabic word that literally means to shake off. What Palestinians are shaking off are Israel's systems of oppression. Intifada means uprising. So call for Palestinians to stand together against violent military occupation and a call for unity among the people. Intifada has always been about collective uprising, demanding change, demanding better, demanding dignity for Palestinians. In the 1980s, the Intifada was a powerful, popular, and largely non-violent protest movement. Strikes, boycotts, Palestinians resisted their economic and social oppression by Israel. And they built networks of community care instead. Israel responded by killing, wounding, arresting, and deporting thousands of Palestinians. 20 years later, Palestinians rose up in non-violent protest again. But when Israel shot live bullets into crowds of unarmed Palestinians, aspects of the second Intifada grew violent as well. Intifada still means uprising. Calling for it in protest is about standing united with Palestinians in their demands for freedom. Across the US and Europe, the word Intifada is being censored. Palestinians and their allies are being silenced for using it. So let's be clear. Attacking people about the language that they used to speak out for Palestinian freedom, that's a cynical distraction from Israel's ongoing genocidal assault on Gaza. So while this made up controversy takes over airtime in US news, Israel's still killing thousands of Palestinians in Gaza with weapons paid for by the US. So no. Palestinians are not going to stop speaking in Arabic, and they're not going to stop shaking off their oppression. If you take issue with Palestinians rising up for change, what you're asking is for them to continue to suffer under Israel's status quo of colonial violence.

And really this law, like about everything else in their regime, is based in white supremacy, racism, and ultimately mid-20th century eugenics. Because the thing is that the most famous and beloved of the Israelites and the Israeli-like kings they weren't pure bloods. Solomon's mother was a canonite. David's grandmother was also a canonite, a moa bite to be specific. And a moa bite so famous she got a whole book in the Bible named after her. The Book of Ruth. What's more is that Ruth and Bichiva, the mother of Solomon, both of these women were widows. And the widow is the carrier of the greatest secret in alchemy. The Freemasons are going to be pretty pissed about me revealing this. But what we call the philosopher's stone is actually the widow's elixir. And the sons of the widow were the real heroes of humanity, which is why a Freemason is otherwise called the son of the widow.

The more identified you are with an age, a gender, a sexuality, a nation, a religion, the easier you are to market to. But the less you identify with, the more you understand that identity is fluid and that you change every single day. That as you watch this video, you're not the same person who watched the last video. Then you're really hard to pin down and categorize. It's really hard to put you in a demographic when you're a shapeshifter. But anyway, back to Ruth, whose book I encourage you to read because it's really short. But basically, Ruth lived with an Israelite woman named Naomi. She got married, her husband died. And eventually when Naomi was sending her and her sister back to her tribe, she decided to stay with Naomi because she loved her so much. She was like, please Naomi, let me go with you and worship your God. Naomi approves, takes her back with her to Israel. She marries an Israelite and eventually becomes the grandmother of King David, a man after God's own heart. And then David, who's basically God's favorite ever, he has a whole herm of Israelite wives that he wins in battle and whatnot. He eventually falls in love with the king and night woman named Betchiva. He sees Betchiva and she is so beautiful like man's cannot contain himself. So he sleeps with her even though she's married and he has such a good time, like he cannot forget that. He wants some more. So he basically sends her husband out to battle and conspires to have him killed so that, you know, he can marry her in peace and have her have his babies. But this makes God angry. And he sends one of his prophets to tell David a whole fable with a moral lesson, which I can get into in another video because it's a super cute story. But basically the lesson is that like David, you literally have everything. You have a whole herm of wives and this poor man, Yoraya, had the one wife and you took her away from him. That's so greedy, bro. And for that, I'm a punish you and unalive your first child with Betchiva because I know she's pregnant. But David repents, God forgives him and he keeps going. Betchiva has another son and his name is Solomon. And we all know that Solomon goes on to be like the king of kings. Solomon is bestowed the honor of building a temple for God. An honor that God did not give to David or anyone before Solomon and hence the importance of Solomon's temple. The temple built by Hiram Abif, the king of Tyre, who was also Oeddo's son, who's really the main character in Freemasonry and the bible's most famous alchemist and who was dispeculated with Solomon's relative. And if the genealogies are correct and Jesus Christ is really the descendant of Solomon and David, then Yeshua was also a canonite. See because Yahweh says a lot of things throughout the Old Testament that you might think are just absolutely horror. But even though he has a rep for doing what he says, he doesn't actually follow through on most of the stuff he says he's going to do. Like he repeatedly says throughout the Old Testament that no one is ever going to remember the canonites, that the Israelites, they're going to erase them, they're going to eradicate them from the face of the earth and no one is ever going to hear about them again. And yet here we are, you and I, talking about them. And there goes Yahweh, one book later, picking a canonite's descendant to be his favorite king. Bro is a talker, okay? Half the stuff he says, if not more than half, doesn't come to pass. And the modern state of Israel, as we should all know by now, has modeled itself on European colonies and specifically the French colon and German tactics for apartheid. Specifically here, that in order for one to maintain a purity of race, which I also don't believe in because it's not scientific, laws need to be implemented to ban intermarriage. But a little bit of critical thinking will show you that if anybody can convert to a religion and then get married, is there any purity of blood being maintained here? Anyway, I think I've rambled enough for now, so come to my life in a few hours. Love you, be free,",subjective

First of all, Egypt is the only Arab nation that borders Gaza. That border at the Sinai Peninsula is the only border that's not fully controlled by Israel. So, in 1967, during the Six Day War, Israel took the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt. They also took the Golden Heights from Syria. Then, in 1973, Ann Warsadot, the President of Egypt, and Hafez Al Assad, the leader of Syria, they teamed up. And they went back to get the land back. The plan kind of worked. It kind of didn't. It worked for Egypt. It worked for Ann Warsadot. Egypt ended up getting the Sinai Peninsula back, but they had to recognize Israel as a country. And also established diplomatic ties. This was done in 1978 through the Camp David Accords, negotiated by President Jimmeth Carter of the U.S. of A. Syria, by the way, still does not have the Golden Heights back, but that's a whole issue. So then, after the Accords, the Egypt Gaza border was set up. And then, in 2005, the Palestinian Authority, the EU in Israel, signed the agreement on movement and access. Or the AMAs, also known as the American Music Awards. Anyways, after a certain person took power in 2007, things got bad. Excuse me, things got even worse. Basically, the Rafa Crossing has had a history of being closed more days than it's been opened. But the blame can be split between Israel, Egyptian government and that other guy. But the thing that you need to know is that historically, the Rafa Crossing has been hard to get through. Also, as you may already know, Palestinians are being extorted for money by Egyptian brokers for upwards of $10,000 per person, just to be put on an evacuation list. That their names might come off of for no reason and at any time. So, something that I really want to stress from this is that when we're talking about Israel and we're talking about the United States government, all that, all that, all that. Look at Egypt.

Since it was only an oral agreement, it was almost impossible to convince other states to endorse it. On the very last day, the negotiations nearly collapsed over the status of Jerusalem. Initially, the idea was for Israel and in Egypt to simply state their positions in a letter attached to the agreement. Israel didn't like the US position, which was that Jerusalem was subject to later negotiations. For them, it implied Jerusalem was occupied territory. The new draft was an exercise in constructive ambiguity. It merely said the US position had been laid out by the two US ambassadors to the UN in 1967 and 1969, but it didn't actually restate the position. Begin and Sadat could live with such terminology and the accords were saved. The announcement of the agreement was a media bombshell. At the signing ceremony, Begin was warm and witty in stole the show. Sadat was more reserved. He had reason to be. The next day, his foreign minister had resigned in protest. Begin's letter on settlements were made public. Instead of a protracted freeze, it spoke of only a three-month freeze. He also explained his views on West Bank autonomy, which were very different from the letter that the US had sent to error leaders. However, Carter didn't push back on these issues. In retrospect, Carter had rushed through the last few days of negotiations in the mid-igradi details. The UN General Assembly later rejected the language on the Palestinian territories as the negotiations didn't include the Palestinians. To make matters worse, the Carter administration and later the Reagan administration did not follow up on the modest accomplishments of Camp David. Carter had gotten caught up in the re-election campaign and the Reagan administration didn't find it to be a high priority. There was also no real effort to work out something on West Bank's autonomy. For their efforts, Sadat and Begin were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978. ADST, follow us for more.",subjective

At Camp David, the leaders of Egypt and Israel shook hands and signed a deal that brought peace between their countries. This agreement has kept the peace for over 40 years now, even through times like the Palestinian uprising and the age group. However, we see a storm is currently brewing at the Egyptian border and here's what you guys need to know. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to send troops into Rafa, a city in Gaza near Egyptian borders. Egypt, understandably, isn't too happy about this. There have been rumors coming out that Egypt is threatening to scrap the entire peace treaty if Benjamin Netanyahu continues to kill these civilians and moves his troops into Rafa. So as of a couple days ago, Egypt has already lined up the border with tanks and S-75 aircrafts. By the way, this is not just about a peace treaty. This deal also sets limits on how many troops each side can have at their border, which Israel is getting ready to break.

In 1878, Israel and Egypt signed the U.S. brokerage Camp David Accords. Shortly after that, Israel gave Sinai back to Egypt as part of the peace treaty. At the time, this was hugely controversial in the Arab world. Egyptian President Anwar Sadaat was assassinated in part because of outrage against it. But it marked the beginning of the end of the wider Arab-Israeli conflict.

The United States has been paying billions of dollars, 3 billion per year to Israel and 2.5 billion per year to Egypt, so that they will allow what Israel is doing. Egypt got bought off. Russia also used to be on the side of Palestine, but if you look at how much money we pay Russia now, and they will never stand for Palestine.

It merely said the US position had been laid out by the two US ambassadors to the UN in 1967 and 1969, but it didn't actually restate the position. Begin and Sadat could live with such terminology and the accords were saved. The announcement of the agreement was a media bombshell. At the signing ceremony, Begin was warm and witty in stole the show. Sadat was more reserved. He had reason to be. The next day, his foreign minister had resigned in protest. Begin's letter on settlements were made public. Instead of a protracted freeze, it spoke of only a three-month freeze. He also explained his views on West Bank autonomy, which were very different from the letter that the US had sent to error leaders. However, Carter didn't push back on these issues. In retrospect, Carter had rushed through the last few days of negotiations in the mid-igradi details. The UN General Assembly later rejected the language on the Palestinian territories as the negotiations didn't include the Palestinians. To make matters worse, the Carter administration and later the Reagan administration did not follow up on the modest accomplishments of Camp David. Carter had gotten caught up in the re-election campaign and the Reagan administration didn't find it to be a high priority. There was also no real effort to work out something on West Bank's autonomy. For their efforts, Sadat and Begin were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978. ADST, follow us for more.",subjective

So to understand what's happening right now, you have to understand what happened back then. So back in the 70s, when tensions between Egypt and Israel were at an all-time high, something happened. At Camp David, the leaders of Egypt and Israel shook hands and signed a deal that brought peace between their countries. This agreement has kept the peace for over 40 years now, even through times like the Palestinian uprising and the age group. However, we see a storm is currently brewing at the Egyptian border and here's what you guys need to know. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to send troops into Rafa, a city in Gaza near Egyptian borders. Egypt, understandably, isn't too happy about this. There have been rumors coming out that Egypt is threatening to scrap the entire peace treaty if Benjamin Netanyahu continues to kill these civilians and moves his troops into Rafa. So as of a couple days ago, Egypt has already lined up the border with tanks and S-75 aircrafts. By the way, this is not just about a peace treaty. This deal also sets limits on how many troops each side can have at their border, which Israel is getting ready to break. Now, if this peace treaty falls apart, this could mean trouble for both countries and we could see more countries being roped into this war.",subjective

In 1878, Israel and Egypt signed the U.S. brokerage Camp David Accords. Shortly after that, Israel gave Sinai back to Egypt as part of the peace treaty. At the time, this was hugely controversial in the Arab world. Egyptian President Anwar Sadaat was assassinated in part because of outrage against it. But it marked the beginning of the end of the wider Arab-Israeli conflict. Over the next few decades, the other Arab states gradually made peace with Israel, even if they never signed formal peace treaties.

The United States has been paying billions of dollars, 3 billion per year to Israel and 2.5 billion per year to Egypt, so that they will allow what Israel is doing. Egypt got bought off. Russia also used to be on the side of Palestine, but if you look at how much money we pay Russia now, and they will never stand for Palestine.

It deals specifically with the future of the West Bank and Gaza and the need to resolve the Palestinian problem in all its aspects. The framework proposes a five year transitional period in the West Bank and Gaza during which the Israeli military government will be withdrawn and a self-governing authority will be elected with full autonomy. It also provides for Israeli forces to remain in specified locations during this period to protect Israel's security. The Palestinians will have the right to participate in the determination of their own future, in negotiations which resolve the final status of the West Bank and Gaza and then to produce an Israeli Jordanian peace treaty. These negotiations will be based on all the provisions and all the principles of United States of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242.

They're going to say, how can you support Palestine? They don't want peace. They've never accepted any of the agreements that have been tabled. So, I'm going to explain each agreement and why they've never been accepted by the Palestinian population while the Israelis are so happy to accept them. First of all, I'm going to talk about pre-1948. These are the two partition plans, the UN Partition Plan in 1947 and the British Peal Commission Partition Plan in 1937. Now, when we're talking about these, it's impossible not to talk about David Bengurian. Bengurian is important for a lot of different reasons. Now, first of all, Bengurian was the first ever Prime Minister of Israel. He was pivotal to the establishment of the Jewish State, but also Bengurian basically was one of the most significant Zionists in that he saw the future. Now, there's arguments for Theodore Herzl and other people like him being the most significant Zionists, but in my opinion, Bengurian really is because he, first of all, he banned the speaking of Yiddish because basically, if you think about it, all of the Jewish people who were coming to Israel were from Europe rather than from any other place. So that would have meant that they would have spoken Yiddish or some other European language, but he basically wanted it all to be Hebrew. So they were united in this culture of being Jewish. But also, he rigged elections against the communists who would want to work with the Arabs, but yeah, anyway, basically, he saw the future. So when I say that Bengurian saw the future, it's basically so important for understanding why the Arabs didn't accept the 1937 Peel Commission partition plan and why the Jewish population did. Now, the Peel Commission plan only gave the Jewish population 20% of the land, giving 80% to the Arabs and the other ethnic groups. But basically, what was significant about this was that for the Arab population, there were only 5% of the demographic was Jewish and therefore giving them 20% of the land seemed bizarre to the Arab population. But for Bengurian, this wasn't an issue because he didn't think that they should show their hand and put all their cards on the table at once. And instead, he basically thought that the idea was to have these areas that were dominated by Jewish people and then they would basically kick any Arabs out of these areas and push them away. This is how a frontier works. If you don't know in the context of America, settlers would keep coming in and in and in and then eventually, when there were enough of them, they would basically just push the Native Americans out by killing them, slaughtering them, moving them away through sometimes through legal policies. Yeah, basically for the Jewish population or the Zionists, it was just easy to accept anything. So after the British Peal Commission's 1937 partition plans, failure, they handed off to the UN and the UN come up with this in 1947. So this is the map that you will probably be most familiar with. So this one is considered pro-Zionist. This is what's on Wikipedia at least because apparently there was 62% of the land given to the Israelis whilst the population of the Arabs was double that. But there are much more issues with this than often I've noted. So see Jaffa, Haifa and all of these places, they have much better agrarian land and they're also the best port cities in historic Palestine. So basically it's a massively unfair rap for the Palestinian people and also look at the separation of this Gaza territory with what is now the modern day West Bank. Basically you see the issue that this is not a good deal for the Arab population who number twice the amount of the Israelis and get a much worse or worse sort of quality of land. So this is probably the next significant moment or sort of thought of significant moment in the peace process. I'm not going to talk about it that much because if you don't know, there was actually no Palestinian representative and Palestinians were barely discussed at this. I don't even think they were actually mentioned because begin the guy on the right who was the then president of Israel didn't want to talk about it. But basically this secured peace between Egypt and Israel, something which was pretty significant because prior to this Gamalab Dornasser, if you don't know who he is, he's sort of seen as the father of pan-Arabism, this idea that the Arab people should unite, had waged a war against Israel in 1967 that had gone awfully and actually sedate himself, scored one of the few significant military victories against Israel or short term military victories called the Yom Kippur War. But in the long run, the Yom Kippur War did not work out very well. And I believe Israel was airdrop, like two billion dollars worth of arms and stuff and straight away they just turn the war around and completely obliterate the Egyptians. But anyway, this is sometimes seen as a significant moment and it's definitely worth researching if you don't know anything about it. And here we have the moment that peace was ostensibly established. Now there are further agreements, there was also the Madrid conference in 1991 and there's Camp David II which is in the early 2000s. But on the right or my right we have Yasir Arifat who was once considered the hero of the Palestinian people and on the left we have Yitzhak Rabin who interestingly enough was actually basically killed by Benjamin Netanyahu. If you don't know Netanyahu in the 1990s, basically incited hatred against this guy for the Oslo Accords and hated him for it and said, oh, this guy is the worst, he's basically selling us to the Palestinians. You know, the Oslo Accords ended up being fucking amazing for the Israelis. But yeah, he ended up dying because of this basically. But a lot of people, and especially when I was at school and talk about Palestine, they were like, oh no, this was actually good and it was a significant moment. This was an awful moment for the Palestinian people and I'll explain why. So the reason Oslo was so bad for the Palestinian people is for a multitude of different reasons. Now, first of all, it established a PA, which is a sensibly the government in Palestine. I am not a big believer in the PA, the Palestinian Authority is what it's called. It's ruled by this guy called Mahmoud Abbas who has basically been promising elections since he was elected many, many years ago after Yasir Arifat died. I think it was in 2001 or something. But anyway, he is a dickhead. He will never leave power. He has let this class rise up around him who are basically just his cronies who do what he says. And they run all the NGOs in Palestine and I've read something that says that they behave like tribal leaders where they believe that they have unlimited authority. NGOs that are meant to help people in Palestine basically just revolve around these people making money and stuff. But what Oslo instituted as well in September 1995, which was the second part of it, it basically established, that was what established the PA, but it also divided the West Bank into three separate zones, which were area A, which were Palestinian cities, which were placed under full Palestinian civilian and security control, area B surrounding towns and villages that, and they're adjacent land, placed under Palestinian civilian control and Israeli security authority and area C comprised the remaining 60% of the West Bank and all these Israeli settlements which was left under full Israeli control. Now if you cannot see the problem with this, you are either a Zionist or someone who just doesn't understand fucking anything. Basically, in this case, it meant that all of the stuff that was meant to be addressed that are basically the contentious issues that relate to a land and settler colonialism like the right of return for the Palestinian refugees, Israeli settlements, Jerusalem and stuff, they were basically left under addressed and they said that there was going to be something done in five years, but obviously it's now been what nearly 30 years since this and nothing has happened, nothing positive for the Palestinian people. So when you reflect on this, how do you expect the Palestinians to have ever accepted any of this? They were basically left in these tiny on enclave that were governed by the Israelis or sometimes by the Palestinian authority which is benevolent to Israel and then it basically just leaves them with a state that cannot function. So if you think that the Palestinians want this and they are just not accepting, not accepting peace because they fucking hate Jewish people, it's just not true. They are not accepting peace because they have never once had a good chance or a good peace deal given to them. Every single time America has put its interest in protecting Israel over actually doing anything to establish peace. Just got the low battery but that was basically the end of the video anyway. I'm sorry that this video is so long but I hope that for some people it's an interesting watch. It's quick and there are much better books that cover this. Preventing Palestine by Seth Antesca is one of the best pieces of literature produced related to the Palestinian peace process. There's also a book by Rashid Halidi which I'll put in the comments, I can't remember the exact name of. There are so many works on this you can just, if you have access to Jastor they will be on there. It's quite often what I'll use to look at it. Yeah, thank you very much. If you watch the whole thing like cheers because this is really long and it's very intense and it discusses a lot of stuff but this is not easy to cram into a four minute video. This video probably won't be very well as well but fuck it who cares if some people watch it that's all I care about. So yeah thank you.",subjective

This is Fatih Numer, a Palestine policy fellow at Al-Shabaka. He explained what went wrong at the Camp David summit in 2000, which were peace talks between the US, Israel and the Palestinian Authority. He said Camp David acts as a case study for the peace talks throughout the years. Camp David is kind of presented as the very generous offer that Arafat refused. It's shown as like this is the big evidence that the Palestinians are not interested in peace and it's thrown around by people who don't actually know any of the details of what was being offered on the table. And all the counter-proposal propaganda is that Houth Barak offered the Palestinians the entirety of the West Bank. But he refused to evacuate any of the settlements. We're talking about a huge number of settlers. So that effectively annexed 10% of the West Bank. He then suggested another 10% be annexed for quote unquote security reasons. So that's already 20% of the West Bank that was annexed before even beginning the negotiations. He suggested that a strip of land between Palestine and Jordan would be also annexed for security reasons. Palestinians would not be in control of their own air space. That would be under Israeli control. They would not be in control of their borders completely. The water situation would remain unchanged, which means that Israel would continue to control the most of the water in the West Bank even though it's under the West Bank. The second thing is that they wanted three permanent military installations in the West Bank. They wanted the right to invade Palestinian territory at any time in the future in a case of an emergency. Of course, what was considered an emergency was not defined. It was left vague on purpose so that it could be justified whenever they invaded. And the cherry on top, of course, is Jerusalem. According to international law, East Jerusalem was occupied in 1967. It was supposed to form the capital of the Palestinian state while West Jerusalem would serve as the capital of the Israeli state. Israel rejected the majority of the demands regarding that they said that sovereignty of East Jerusalem would remain firmly within the hands of the Israeli state. Even though the Palestinians said that, hey, you could take sovereignty over the Jewish neighborhoods, Jewish holy sites, all of that take it for Israel, even the settlements, the illegal settlements. They were agreeing to maintain the illegal settlements in East Jerusalem. And there is really control in return for a kind of, you know, land swap, which never materialized obviously. But this was rejected. These are the kinds of offers that Palestinians were given. Like, it is not an actual sovereign state. It was never an intention to have an actual sovereign state. And rejecting such a thing is not irrational. No more banami who was the foreign minister at the time. I was one of the chief negotiators for the Israeli team. He said that... Cam David was not the least opportunity for the Palestinians. And if I were a Palestinian, I would have rejected Cam David as well. But this all gets buried underneath the propaganda because it was important to create or craft a narrative that the Palestinians are intransigent and they refuse peace. And that is what was succeeded.",subjective

The document that calls for peace between Israel and Egypt specifies a very particular timetable which could produce peace between those two nations within a year and withdrawal to begin within two or three months. That agreement, however, is, as you heard earlier, subject to approval of the Kinesit regarding withdrawal of the Israeli settlements in the Sinai, which has been a very major sticking point and was one of the causes of the breakdown. I might say that the first document is quite comprehensive in nature and composing a framework by which Israel can later negotiate peace treaties between herself and Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, as well as the outline of this document that we will now sign. And as you will later see in studying the documents, it also provides for the realization of the hopes and dreams of the people who live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and will ensure Israel peace in the generations ahead. This second document is one relating to a framework for a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. And this is a document that calls for the completion of the peace treaty negotiations within three months. And I have noticed a challenge extended by these two gentlemen to each other and that they will complete within three months. I might say that this document encompasses almost all of the issues between the two countries and resolves those issues. A few lines remain to be drawn on maps and the question of the settlements is to be resolved. Other than that, most of the major issues are resolved already in this document. And we will now sign this document as well. As President Carter has said, he is going to go into a great deal more detail before a joint session of Congress tomorrow night. And it was expected that Prime Minister Vagan and President Sedot will appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday. At least that was the plan earlier today and before it was known that this meeting was going into night with this particular ceremony. If they stick with that proposed schedule, they will talk to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee perhaps on Tuesday. Meanwhile, of course, each of these two other gentlemen will be appearing for their own news conferences and explaining their interpretations of the agreements. Thank you very much. And so after 30 years of war, the entire lifetime of the Osayra State and agreement for peace, at least for a framework for peace in the Middle East, it is indeed a historic moment. Marvin Cowd, from your vantage point of view, has seen your diplomatic correspondent what have they had to give up to get these agreements? What is it on there? Well, Waller, it's quite clear that there were major concessions that were made by both sides. On Egypt's sides, Sedot dropped his demand for a commitment now. The total is rarely withdrawal from the West Bank. The question of sovereignty over this disputed area is left open at least for the time being. The final status will be negotiated, they say, within the next five years. On Israel's side, it seems that Vagan has agreed to negotiate the removal of Israeli settlements from the Sinai once his parliament approves. He has agreed to freeze the building of new Israeli settlements on the West Bank, and he's agreed to return three major airfields in the Sinai to Egyptian civilian control. Now both Sedot and Vagan are left with the responsibility of selling those concessions to their own constituencies. And Bob Sheeper, from the White House, what did President Carter get? Did he get what he wanted? I would think so, Waller. You know, there are a couple of hooks on and all this. First, Jordan must agree to these arrangements on the West Bank, or you don't have much there. And the question of the Israeli settlements in the Sinai must be settled, or there can be no peace agreement at all. But still, it seems to me that this is going to be seen as really a remarkable achievement for the President. Just look at two weeks ago what the situation was. Peace process, all but dead. You bring people together in a situation unlike we've ever had before, truly an extraordinary event. And tonight you have these two people talking about signing a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. It was a high stakes venture. They called it that at the start, well tonight, from what we know about it. We haven't seen the documents yet. It appears that the President won, and he won big. And tomorrow night he goes before a joint session of Congress at 8 o'clock Eastern time to report to the Congress and through the Congress, to the people on what he accomplished at Camp David. And we expect to hear more from Prime Minister Began and Egyptian President Sadat tomorrow as well. This is Walter Krongey, CBS News, Washington. This has been a CBS News special report from Washington.",subjective

The section on his presidency really focuses a lot on the Camp David Accords. If you don't know what the Camp David Accords are, it was their attempt, the United States attempt at brokering peace between Egypt and Israel. There were three main players. It was Jimmy Carter, of course, president of the United States at the time. The Israeli Prime Minister, and I'm probably going to butcher their names. And I really apologize if I do. It's Menechem Began. I'm just going to call him Began the whole time. He was the Israeli Prime Minister and he seems like a very interesting character who I'm going to need to watch a documentary on. He has a very long backstory that I do not want to diminish, but I am not going to cover here. He was a militant Zionist, okay, and he really seems to be the force that solidified the Zionist movement. The third player is Anwar Sadat, who was the president of Egypt at the time. There are sections in this chapter that really do illustrate the attitude that each of the players came to the table with. And there are some sections in here that I want to just read to you so that you can get an idea of what each person or each entity was really focused on. And then we'll talk about how it actually ended up. Okay, so the first thing is I wanted to read you with something that I thought, well, geez, that sounds freaking familiar. So Carter writes, unfortunately, my working relationship with Menechem Began became even more difficult in March when the PLO launched an attack on Israel from the base in southern Lebanon. A sightseeing bus was seized, and 35 Israelis were killed. I publicly condemned this outrageous act, but my sympathy was strained three days later when Israel invaded Lebanon and used American-made anti-personnel clusterbonds against Beirut and other urban centers, killing hundreds of civilians and leaving thousands homeless. I considered this major invasion to be an overreaction to the PLO attack, a serious threat to peace in the region, and perhaps part of a plan to establish permanent Israeli presence in southern Lebanon. Also, such use of American weapons violated a legal requirement that armament sold by U.S. by us be used only for Israeli defense against an attack. Okay, moving on though, just sounded very familiar. So when they came to these peace talks, it was in September of 1978. There are several books on the Camp David Cords. I'm not going to go through the actual accords and things like that. There's 13 days in September is a book on the Camp David Cords. There's numerous documentaries. You can read the accords online if you want. They're actually in the appendix of this book, but the peace talk priorities went as such. We had to address such basic questions as Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories. Palestinian rights, Israel's security, and end to the Arab trade embargo, open borders between Israel and Egypt, the rights of Israeli ships to transit the Suez Canal, and the sensitive issue concerning sovereignty over Jerusalem and access to the holy places. That last part really seems to be Jimmy Carter's primary motivator at that time. I don't know if it is so much anymore, but at that time he was very interested in maintaining all persons access to the holy lands and making sure that there were amenities and things like that, that there was infrastructure around Jerusalem and Canaan and things like that, so that people of any faith could come to the holy lands. Now, as for Prime Minister Began, his motives in this seem to be the most questionable Carter rights. At least with Began, every word of the final agreement was carefully considered, and he and I spent a lot of time perusing of the Soros and Addictionary. He was a careful semanticist. He surprised me once when I had proposed autonomy for the Palestinians. He insisted on full autonomy. Began came to Camp David intending just to work out a statement of broad general principles for a peace agreement, leaving to subordinates the task of resolving the more difficult details. It was soon obvious that he was more interested in discussing the Sinai than the West Bank and Gaza, and he spent the best part of his energy on the minute details of each proposal. For those of you who don't know what semantics are, so it says that he was a careful semantics. Semantics are a branch of linguistics and logic concerned with meaning. Anytime somebody has said, okay, now we're just arguing semantics. That means that you're spending more time arguing the meaning of the words that you're saying, rather than discussing the actual context of the conflict at hand. It seems like Began came with a goal of just arguing semantics. After we get through the back and forth between the different parties and going through some different details about who said what to whom, it comes down to a few different things there, they thought that they had like brokered peace. The Accords generally recognize that continuing to treat non-Jews in occupied territories as a substratum of society is contrary to the principles of morality and justice on which democracies are founded. We go through a little bit of other stuff and it says this. Sadat, remember, on where Sadat is the president of Egypt at the time. Sadat always insisted that the first priority must be adherence to UN Resolution 242 and self-determination for the Palestinians and everyone, perhaps accepting Began, was convinced that these rights had been protected in the final documents. A little bit further down, perhaps the most serious omission of the Camp David Talks was the failure to clarify in writing Began's verbal promise concerning the settlement freeze during subsequent peace talks. The Israelis have never granted any appreciable autonomy to the Palestinians and instead of withdrawing their military and political forces, Israeli leaders have tightened their hold on the occupied territories. That is a big statement for then and now. This next part, until much later, long after, I left public office, neither their Jordan Danians nor the PLO were willing to participate in subsequent peace talks with Israel. This confirms that Israeli sphere, the nation's existence would again be threatened as soon as their adversaries could accumulate enough strength to mount a military challenge. You hear this argument all the time, I've heard it from Hillary Clinton, from Joe Biden, lots of others, people all the time say, well, they've offered peace talks so many times, but you have to remember the thing that came before that. The Israeli's have never granted any appreciable autonomy to the Palestinians and instead of withdrawing their military and political forces, Israeli leaders have tightened their hold on the occupied territories. Why would they come to peace talks if they just continue to tighten their hold? Okay, finally. We all knew that Israel must have comprehensive and lasting peace and this dream could have been realized if Israel had complied with the Camp David Accords and refrained from colonizing the West Bank, with Arabs accepting Israel within the legal borders.",subjective

What is it going to take for our leaders to be fucking leaders? I didn't do a whole lot yesterday. I laid in bed for a long time. I dashed in the evening. I came home, I did laundry, went to bed, woke up, got ready, worked, and so I'm just kind of getting caught up on some things over the last few days. How the fuck are we going to allow Israel to play commercials in the Super Bowl? About anti-Semitism or Hamas, fund their genocide, and sit back and do nothing as they bomb the ever-loving fucking shit out of Rafa. I said this months ago now. Their whole goal is to corral Palestinians into as small areas possible, i.e. Rafa. And then once they have them all there to bomb them, my eye is fucking twitching. And that's what they did. That is exactly what the fuck they did. They got them into Rafa and they bombed the fucking shit out of them. And what the fuck does Biden say? Biden says you need to have a credible plan. Fuck you, Biden. This is their credible plan. Then a side is their fucking plan. Fuck you, Biden. Fuck your bullshit leadership. Fuck your bullshit compassion. Fuck your bullshit. Fig everything. You're a joke. You're a weak ass joke. It doesn't feel like all that long ago except at the same time it feels like a lifetime ago that I used to say that Biden would go down as one of the most underrated presidents, right? In history. I was so wrong. I was so wrong. You will forever and only be known as genocide pussy ass Joe. You're a bitch. And in the worst kind of way, you are a weak ass bitch. Fuck you Joe Biden. And fuck every single fucking person that stands behind you and does nothing. If ever there was a time that we needed leadership in this world, it is now. And for all of the shit that America claims and talks about how wonderful we are or how moral and righteous we are, we should be the ones putting our foot down and putting it into this. But we are fueling it. And I have never been more ashamed to be a motherfucking American in my life. Fuck the Biden administration and fuck everybody that has played a part in this whatsoever. Fuck you. The other day Netanyahu came out and he said, and then we're going to order the population of Rafa to evacuate. This is an absurd comment to make because there is literally nowhere for these people to go. Those of you who don't know, Rafa is the shared border between Gaza and Egypt. Early on in the bombing campaign, North Gaza was effectively wiped off the map. Palestinians were told to move to South Gaza, then Israel proceeded to bomb the South as well. And so everybody is kind of caught in this little corner of Gaza. About the size of LAX airport, there is over a million Palestinians. There are a million in this area. The size of LAX is the most populated and dense place as of right now. There is nowhere else to go. And they are being told, hey, we are giving you a heads up. We are going to bomb Rafa. So this was, you know, five alarm fire, you know, people are looking at this like, what are you talking about? How can you bomb this area where, you know, it is the remainder of the civilians in Gaza. Okay, well, then we had Biden comes out and he says, well, Israel shouldn't press into Rafa without a credible plan to protect civilians. Being more humanitarian with your bombing campaign, you need a credible plan for the civilians to go out. Engleware, the border shot, they can't go to Egypt, by the way, if they were pressed into Egypt anyway, that would be an ethnic cleansing. They can't go to other places in Gaza. It's bullshit because what he can and should do is a, if they drop a single bomb in Rafa, we're getting off all their money, we're cutting off all their weapons, we're going to condemn them at the UN and sanctions are on the table. That's how you do action that might lead to results. What the fuck Biden? Instead, it's our you should have a credible plan with your genocide campaign. What? What? Okay, there's more. Bing beer, fuck face extraordinaire comes out and says in writing online that is there forever, shoot anybody that comes near the fence. Women, children, they're all terrorists anyway. Sorry, unalive them. They really don't care. It's truly believed that there will be no consequences because they are already being investigated for genocide. There has already been a ruling saying, hey, there's a good chance you're already committing genocide. Stop doing it, let humanitarian aid in and like, stop people. Israel said, hold my beer. Superbowl ad. Boms. Jinniside or rhetoric? Boms away. And they bombed the border. Like, that's Egyptian land. That's their territory. They bombed it. I have no room to talk as an American sitting here, but Egypt. Are you like, bomb them back? I mean, don't bomb them back. But bomb them back. Anybody? Any fucking leader? Do something. I have now had a twitch in my eye for like going on a week now and it gets so much worse when I get angry or frustrated. There's more. We get this. Israel comes out and says we've rescued two hostages from captivity in Gaza. And I think I saw one article that you've even said, no, it was actually four. Meanwhile, what was actually going on on the ground? Rafa was bombed to smithereens. There was bombing that went on for, I guess, 30 minutes to an hour. If you know anything about Netanyahu, his government, but also where Israeli societies, the reaction that this was going to go in was 100% predictable and predicted from the beginning. And all we have ever gotten are these pathetic and impotent leaks about how concerned they are. So the stakes here could not possibly be higher. Egypt, they are furious, but they are threatening to suspend the camp date of course that were negotiated by Jimmy Carter. In Egypt, is writing to suspend that peace treaty? If Israeli troops are sent into the density populated Gaza border town of Rafa, it's fighting their force to closure of the territories main aid supply route to Egyptian officials in Western diplomat said Sunday that threat to suspend the camp David accordance of cornerstone of regional stability for nearly half a century came after babysat troops into Rafa and said that it was necessary to win the four month old war against the Palestinian militant group. Hamas, Egypt fears a mass influx of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees who may never be allowed to return. By the way, Netanyahu and an interview said that civilians in Rafa could flee more. It's plenty of areas that have been cleared by the army said Israel's developing a detailed plan. A European Union foreign policy chief said an Israeli offensive on Rafa with each one unspeakable humanitarian catastrophe and grave tensions with Egypt. Egypt was also extremely pissed at Joe Biden's comments accusing them of blocking aid from coming in and also released a statement saying basically like this is bullshit we've been trying to help with aid the whole time. But I mean this is a threat of war effectively. We shouldn't forget Egypt and Israel's fought a lot of wars believe in numbers five yet in terms of the number of full blown military conflicts. Other than the Cuban missile crisis, the closest of the world has ever come to a nuclear exchange was the Yom Kupur War. It was considered one of the most important things that he did while he was president that the Arab states are a genuine leading push into a corner. This is from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They say the KSA will warns of quote very serious repercussions of storming and targeting of the city of Rafa in the Gaza Strip. The Saudis have a major military they have capacity for probably more important for Israel's case. They got a lot of money and they have a lot of money and ties to a lot of people were very willing to blow themselves up inside of Israel and nearby the Saudi royal family. They don't care about Palestine. They barely even care about the Arabs. The Saudi population and the Saudi clerics, those people care a lot. The KSA, they rely upon basically the acquiescence of their people and of the clerics to keep things going. But there is some sort of ethnic clandings they may not have a choice. They may not have a choice. They need to support Egypt so we could find ourselves in a serious Yom Kupur level crisis. We've already had the Egyptian Prime Minister, I think, who has said that they quote will sacrifice millions to make sure that there is no mass expulsion of people. That is a threat of war. So now it's the question, you know what is going to happen. How much confidence do you really have in Israeli targetings? If they blow up the wall or border area crossing, then people will just run into the Sinai. It's not like these Israelis are going to let them back in. That's what they want. Now we're in a genuine standoff in a crisis and that's a war and we will find ourselves involved in that. We supply both sides of it. I mean, people have been forced into unimaginable circumstances. Nothing to return to. Living intense amidst a million other people starving to death, no sanitation, medical facilities bombed. The level of desperation absolutely means that if the border is bombed and the crossing is open, people will flee into Egypt. I don't blame them at all. Of course, they're definitely going to their life. I would do the same thing and not to be clear. And those conditions directly created by Israel sometimes resettlement are conditions that you create until people leave threatened to kill them and bond their children until they have no choice but to flee for their lives. And those are the conditions they have already created. The only thing standing between the complete goal of ethnic cleansing of the territory and not is the rough border. So that that's where we are. That is the precipice that we're standing on. You know, in terms of this week phone call of Biden to BB saying like, oh, you can't attack Rafa until there's some sort of plan for civilians. That's basically a green light. Number one is certainly not saying I'm going to do anything about it. Number two, it's not even saying don't do it. It's saying, oh, you have to float some kind of a plan for civilians in the area, which BB is claiming that he's doing. Even though there is nowhere else for these people to go, they are already pressed up against the southern border and the rest of the Gaza Strip has already been destroyed and occupied. It's a horrifying and terrifying moment for these human beings. And it is a terrifying moment for us and the world as well. I genuinely think we are on the precipice of absolute chaos. I don't know how much more obvious they need to make it for you, Joe. This is their plan. This has always been their plan. They have said that this is their plan. You just refuse to hear it. That's not true. You hear it. You just don't give a fuck.",subjective

First of all, Egypt is the only Arab nation that borders Gaza. That border at the Sinai Peninsula is the only border that's not fully controlled by Israel. So, in 1967, during the Six Day War, Israel took the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt. They also took the Golden Heights from Syria. Then, in 1973, Ann Warsadot, the President of Egypt, and Hafez Al Assad, the leader of Syria, they teamed up. And they went back to get the land back. The plan kind of worked. It kind of didn't. It worked for Egypt. It worked for Ann Warsadot. Egypt ended up getting the Sinai Peninsula back, but they had to recognize Israel as a country. And also established diplomatic ties. This was done in 1978 through the Camp David Accords, negotiated by President Jimmeth Carter of the U.S. of A. Syria, by the way, still does not have the Golden Heights back, but that's a whole issue. So then, after the Accords, the Egypt Gaza border was set up. And then, in 2005, the Palestinian Authority, the EU in Israel, signed the agreement on movement and access. Or the AMAs, also known as the American Music Awards. Anyways, after a certain person took power in 2007, things got bad. Excuse me, things got even worse. Basically, the Rafa Crossing has had a history of being closed more days than it's been opened. But the blame can be split between Israel, Egyptian government and that other guy. But the thing that you need to know is that historically, the Rafa Crossing has been hard to get through. Also, as you may already know, Palestinians are being extorted for money by Egyptian brokers for upwards of $10,000 per person, just to be put on an evacuation list. That their names might come off of for no reason and at any time. So, something that I really want to stress from this is that when we're talking about Israel and we're talking about the United States government, all that, all that, all that. Look at Egypt. Look at the Egyptian government because they have a hand to play in making it as hard as possible for Palestinians to get out. If you're interested, I'll have a video on my YouTube channel that goes more into depth about the 1967 Six Day War, about the 1973 October War, just because more into depth about all of it, everything from start to finish the Golden Heights, the Sinai Peninsula, all of it, mama, all of it.

One was West Bank Gaza autonomy. There was no definition of what autonomy meant. To Egypt, it was self-determination. To Israel, it was a kind of bondage status. The draft also said nothing about future Israeli settlements. Begin did promise President Carter a protracted freeze on settlements until a self-governing authority could be set up. Since it was only an oral agreement, it was almost impossible to convince other states to endorse it. On the very last day, the negotiations nearly collapsed over the status of Jerusalem. Initially, the idea was for Israel and in Egypt to simply state their positions in a letter attached to the agreement. Israel didn't like the US position, which was that Jerusalem was subject to later negotiations. For them, it implied Jerusalem was occupied territory. The new draft was an exercise in constructive ambiguity. It merely said the US position had been laid out by the two US ambassadors to the UN in 1967 and 1969, but it didn't actually restate the position. Begin and Sadat could live with such terminology and the accords were saved. The announcement of the agreement was a media bombshell. At the signing ceremony, Begin was warm and witty in stole the show. Sadat was more reserved. He had reason to be. The next day, his foreign minister had resigned in protest. Begin's letter on settlements were made public. Instead of a protracted freeze, it spoke of only a three-month freeze. He also explained his views on West Bank autonomy, which were very different from the letter that the US had sent to error leaders. However, Carter didn't push back on these issues. In retrospect, Carter had rushed through the last few days of negotiations in the mid-igradi details. The UN General Assembly later rejected the language on the Palestinian territories as the negotiations didn't include the Palestinians. To make matters worse, the Carter administration and later the Reagan administration did not follow up on the modest accomplishments of Camp David. Carter had gotten caught up in the re-election campaign and the Reagan administration didn't find it to be a high priority. There was also no real effort to work out something on West Bank's autonomy. For their efforts, Sadat and Begin were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978. ADST, follow us for more.",subjective

So as of a couple days ago, Egypt has already lined up the border with tanks and S-75 aircrafts. By the way, this is not just about a peace treaty.

The United States has been paying billions of dollars, 3 billion per year to Israel and 2.5 billion per year to Egypt, so that they will allow what Israel is doing. Egypt got bought off. Russia also used to be on the side of Palestine, but if you look at how much money we pay Russia now, and they will never stand for Palestine. If you look at any Middle Eastern country and just type in how much these United States pay them, you will see this is literally all money. It's about money.

But we should all recognize the substantial achievements that have been made. And the agreements that President Sadat and Prime Minister Began are signing tonight is entitled, a framework for peace in the Middle East. This framework concerns the principles and some specifics in the most substantive way which will govern a comprehensive peace settlement. It deals specifically with the future of the West Bank and Gaza and the need to resolve the Palestinian problem in all its aspects. The framework proposes a five year transitional period in the West Bank and Gaza during which the Israeli military government will be withdrawn and a self-governing authority will be elected with full autonomy. It also provides for Israeli forces to remain in specified locations during this period to protect Israel's security. The Palestinians will have the right to participate in the determination of their own future, in negotiations which resolve the final status of the West Bank and Gaza and then to produce an Israeli Jordanian peace treaty. These negotiations will be based on all the provisions and all the principles of United States of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. And it provides that Israel may live in peace within secure and recognized borders.

They're going to say, how can you support Palestine? They don't want peace. They've never accepted any of the agreements that have been tabled. So, I'm going to explain each agreement and why they've never been accepted by the Palestinian population while the Israelis are so happy to accept them. First of all, I'm going to talk about pre-1948. These are the two partition plans, the UN Partition Plan in 1947 and the British Peal Commission Partition Plan in 1937. Now, when we're talking about these, it's impossible not to talk about David Bengurian. Bengurian is important for a lot of different reasons. Now, first of all, Bengurian was the first ever Prime Minister of Israel. He was pivotal to the establishment of the Jewish State, but also Bengurian basically was one of the most significant Zionists in that he saw the future. Now, there's arguments for Theodore Herzl and other people like him being the most significant Zionists, but in my opinion, Bengurian really is because he, first of all, he banned the speaking of Yiddish because basically, if you think about it, all of the Jewish people who were coming to Israel were from Europe rather than from any other place. So that would have meant that they would have spoken Yiddish or some other European language, but he basically wanted it all to be Hebrew. So they were united in this culture of being Jewish. But also, he rigged elections against the communists who would want to work with the Arabs, but yeah, anyway, basically, he saw the future. So when I say that Bengurian saw the future, it's basically so important for understanding why the Arabs didn't accept the 1937 Peel Commission partition plan and why the Jewish population did. Now, the Peel Commission plan only gave the Jewish population 20% of the land, giving 80% to the Arabs and the other ethnic groups. But basically, what was significant about this was that for the Arab population, there were only 5% of the demographic was Jewish and therefore giving them 20% of the land seemed bizarre to the Arab population. But for Bengurian, this wasn't an issue because he didn't think that they should show their hand and put all their cards on the table at once. And instead, he basically thought that the idea was to have these areas that were dominated by Jewish people and then they would basically kick any Arabs out of these areas and push them away. This is how a frontier works. If you don't know in the context of America, settlers would keep coming in and in and in and then eventually, when there were enough of them, they would basically just push the Native Americans out by killing them, slaughtering them, moving them away through sometimes through legal policies. Yeah, basically for the Jewish population or the Zionists, it was just easy to accept anything. So after the British Peal Commission's 1937 partition plans, failure, they handed off to the UN and the UN come up with this in 1947. So this is the map that you will probably be most familiar with. So this one is considered pro-Zionist. This is what's on Wikipedia at least because apparently there was 62% of the land given to the Israelis whilst the population of the Arabs was double that. But there are much more issues with this than often I've noted. So see Jaffa, Haifa and all of these places, they have much better agrarian land and they're also the best port cities in historic Palestine. So basically it's a massively unfair rap for the Palestinian people and also look at the separation of this Gaza territory with what is now the modern day West Bank. Basically you see the issue that this is not a good deal for the Arab population who number twice the amount of the Israelis and get a much worse or worse sort of quality of land. So this is probably the next significant moment or sort of thought of significant moment in the peace process. I'm not going to talk about it that much because if you don't know, there was actually no Palestinian representative and Palestinians were barely discussed at this. I don't even think they were actually mentioned because begin the guy on the right who was the then president of Israel didn't want to talk about it. But basically this secured peace between Egypt and Israel, something which was pretty significant because prior to this Gamalab Dornasser, if you don't know who he is, he's sort of seen as the father of pan-Arabism, this idea that the Arab people should unite, had waged a war against Israel in 1967 that had gone awfully and actually sedate himself, scored one of the few significant military victories against Israel or short term military victories called the Yom Kippur War. But in the long run, the Yom Kippur War did not work out very well. And I believe Israel was airdrop, like two billion dollars worth of arms and stuff and straight away they just turn the war around and completely obliterate the Egyptians. But anyway, this is sometimes seen as a significant moment and it's definitely worth researching if you don't know anything about it. And here we have the moment that peace was ostensibly established. Now there are further agreements, there was also the Madrid conference in 1991 and there's Camp David II which is in the early 2000s. But on the right or my right we have Yasir Arifat who was once considered the hero of the Palestinian people and on the left we have Yitzhak Rabin who interestingly enough was actually basically killed by Benjamin Netanyahu. If you don't know Netanyahu in the 1990s, basically incited hatred against this guy for the Oslo Accords and hated him for it and said, oh, this guy is the worst, he's basically selling us to the Palestinians. You know, the Oslo Accords ended up being fucking amazing for the Israelis. But yeah, he ended up dying because of this basically. But a lot of people, and especially when I was at school and talk about Palestine, they were like, oh no, this was actually good and it was a significant moment. This was an awful moment for the Palestinian people and I'll explain why. So the reason Oslo was so bad for the Palestinian people is for a multitude of different reasons. Now, first of all, it established a PA, which is a sensibly the government in Palestine. I am not a big believer in the PA, the Palestinian Authority is what it's called. It's ruled by this guy called Mahmoud Abbas who has basically been promising elections since he was elected many, many years ago after Yasir Arifat died. I think it was in 2001 or something. But anyway, he is a dickhead. He will never leave power. He has let this class rise up around him who are basically just his cronies who do what he says. And they run all the NGOs in Palestine and I've read something that says that they behave like tribal leaders where they believe that they have unlimited authority. NGOs that are meant to help people in Palestine basically just revolve around these people making money and stuff. But what Oslo instituted as well in September 1995, which was the second part of it, it basically established, that was what established the PA, but it also divided the West Bank into three separate zones, which were area A, which were Palestinian cities, which were placed under full Palestinian civilian and security control, area B surrounding towns and villages that, and they're adjacent land, placed under Palestinian civilian control and Israeli security authority and area C comprised the remaining 60% of the West Bank and all these Israeli settlements which was left under full Israeli control. Now if you cannot see the problem with this, you are either a Zionist or someone who just doesn't understand fucking anything. Basically, in this case, it meant that all of the stuff that was meant to be addressed that are basically the contentious issues that relate to a land and settler colonialism like the right of return for the Palestinian refugees, Israeli settlements, Jerusalem and stuff, they were basically left under addressed and they said that there was going to be something done in five years, but obviously it's now been what nearly 30 years since this and nothing has happened, nothing positive for the Palestinian people. So when you reflect on this, how do you expect the Palestinians to have ever accepted any of this? They were basically left in these tiny on enclave that were governed by the Israelis or sometimes by the Palestinian authority which is benevolent to Israel and then it basically just leaves them with a state that cannot function. So if you think that the Palestinians want this and they are just not accepting, not accepting peace because they fucking hate Jewish people, it's just not true. They are not accepting peace because they have never once had a good chance or a good peace deal given to them. Every single time America has put its interest in protecting Israel over actually doing anything to establish peace. Just got the low battery but that was basically the end of the video anyway. I'm sorry that this video is so long but I hope that for some people it's an interesting watch. It's quick and there are much better books that cover this. Preventing Palestine by Seth Antesca is one of the best pieces of literature produced related to the Palestinian peace process. There's also a book by Rashid Halidi which I'll put in the comments, I can't remember the exact name of. There are so many works on this you can just, if you have access to Jastor they will be on there. It's quite often what I'll use to look at it. Yeah, thank you very much. If you watch the whole thing like cheers because this is really long and it's very intense and it discusses a lot of stuff but this is not easy to cram into a four minute video. This video probably won't be very well as well but fuck it who cares if some people watch it that's all I care about. So yeah thank you.",subjective

This is Fatih Numer, a Palestine policy fellow at Al-Shabaka. He explained what went wrong at the Camp David summit in 2000, which were peace talks between the US, Israel and the Palestinian Authority. He said Camp David acts as a case study for the peace talks throughout the years. Camp David is kind of presented as the very generous offer that Arafat refused. It's shown as like this is the big evidence that the Palestinians are not interested in peace and it's thrown around by people who don't actually know any of the details of what was being offered on the table. And all the counter-proposal propaganda is that Houth Barak offered the Palestinians the entirety of the West Bank. But he refused to evacuate any of the settlements. We're talking about a huge number of settlers. So that effectively annexed 10% of the West Bank. He then suggested another 10% be annexed for quote unquote security reasons. So that's already 20% of the West Bank that was annexed before even beginning the negotiations. He suggested that a strip of land between Palestine and Jordan would be also annexed for security reasons. Palestinians would not be in control of their own air space. That would be under Israeli control. They would not be in control of their borders completely. The water situation would remain unchanged, which means that Israel would continue to control the most of the water in the West Bank even though it's under the West Bank. The second thing is that they wanted three permanent military installations in the West Bank. They wanted the right to invade Palestinian territory at any time in the future in a case of an emergency. Of course, what was considered an emergency was not defined. It was left vague on purpose so that it could be justified whenever they invaded. And the cherry on top, of course, is Jerusalem. According to international law, East Jerusalem was occupied in 1967. It was supposed to form the capital of the Palestinian state while West Jerusalem would serve as the capital of the Israeli state. Israel rejected the majority of the demands regarding that they said that sovereignty of East Jerusalem would remain firmly within the hands of the Israeli state. Even though the Palestinians said that, hey, you could take sovereignty over the Jewish neighborhoods, Jewish holy sites, all of that take it for Israel, even the settlements, the illegal settlements. They were agreeing to maintain the illegal settlements in East Jerusalem. And there is really control in return for a kind of, you know, land swap, which never materialized obviously. But this was rejected. These are the kinds of offers that Palestinians were given. Like, it is not an actual sovereign state. It was never an intention to have an actual sovereign state. And rejecting such a thing is not irrational. No more banami who was the foreign minister at the time. I was one of the chief negotiators for the Israeli team. He said that... Cam David was not the least opportunity for the Palestinians. And if I were a Palestinian, I would have rejected Cam David as well. But this all gets buried underneath the propaganda because it was important to create or craft a narrative that the Palestinians are intransigent and they refuse peace. And that is what was succeeded.",subjective

And you may think I am delusional, but we are getting to the point where both sides are weak and completely exhausted. Israel is in fact weaker now than any time in my lifetime. It is weaker and less secure than it has been since 1948. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis have had to leave their border towns because they're no longer safe. That's never happened before. And today's existential enemy for Israel, and it is existential, is not really Hamas or the Palestinians, it's Iran and all the Iranian proxies, including Hamas. Iran and its proxies want to annihilate Israel and they are strong. And this war between Israel and Hamas probably would have already spread further, if not for the help of the United States, which is strategically bombing Iranian proxy targets in Iraq and elsewhere. Israel can no longer do it alone. And when this war ends, Hamas will be gone from governance, but Hamas will still be present in Gaza and Iran will still be a potent force trying to annihilate Israel. When this war ends, Israel will be weak and exhausted. I'm not happy about that. That's just the way it is. And when this war ends, Palestine will be weak and exhausted. About one-third of its populace will be living in rubble. And thousands of innocent civilians, Israeli, Palestinian, will have died. And if it's true that peace is really only possible in this region when both sides are weak and exhausted, it will be the best opportunity for peace.

Thanks, Senator Rush. Okay, Deputy Baibar. Ambassador, I will say frankly, I'm one of the people who thinks you should be expelled from this country and I believe that that's nothing to do with you personally. It's to do with the policies of your state and I think along with Desmond Tutu that the time for treason use in normal state is over because you're not behaving as a normal state and I just want to ask you questions really in relation to us contention and I would just say for the record. It certainly isn't motivated by antisemitism in my case. For example, when disgraceful attempts were being made to downplay the horrors of the Holocaust by people like Dave Irving, I brought Jewish outfits of our diverse city to organize meetings and get around national television to remind the Irish people about the horrors of the Holocaust and I would do so again if anybody tried to downplay the horrors of what were done to the Jewish people. But it is precisely because I'm opposed to racism and I oppose what your state is doing and what it stands for. So I just want to ask you a few questions in relation to that. I'm going to also say by the way I lived for a year, a motion at Nihoti, Nihoti Agi Kar in the Dead Sea in 1987, two weeks before the first intefat of rope-out. That leads me to my first question. You have tried to cover over what you have done, the killings of innocent people and gars and have three separatications over recent years, the seizure of Palestinian land and so on by attacking Hamas. And why don't you just admit that Hamas didn't exist when the first intfat took place. They didn't set up an armed wing until the early 1990s and there was a reason that P. L. O. in Tunis at the time exiled, effectively not present. But the ordinary Palestinians rose up because you denied them basic rights. I lived there. It was apartheid, was racism, was endemic, was rotten. Absolutely I was shocked within weeks of living there to see how you treated Palestinian people. And isn't it the fact that the law of return, which is the basic law of the Israeli state, is a racist apartheid law because it confers rights on Jews that it denies to Palestinians? It allows, for example, if I was Jewish and had never stepped foot in Israel, I could claim citizenship there tomorrow, but six million people whose origins are in what you now call Israel, who were forced out in 1947 or 1948 to not have that right. Isn't that part of the reason by the Palestinians are in dispute with Israelis? Because you denied them the right to return to their homes and to their land and to their villages. And today have a legitimate claim, even under international law, to return, but you denied them that right. Why do you deny them that right? And why do you give that right to other people who have no connection whatsoever with the land, whether you call it Israel or whether you call it Palestine? Why do you continue to seize land if you're serious about Oslo and the two state solution? Why do you continue to seize land which under that agreement is land designated to be Palestinian land? Five hundred thousand people, most of which has taken place since Oslo, you allow that to happen. Why do you allow it to happen if you're serious about giving this land to the Palestinians? It's absolutely extraordinary. And it just, are you not just taking us ambassador for ideas that you can say with a straight face, we're serious about peace, but while we're serious about peace, we're going to seize Palestinian land. And you expect the Palestinians to sit back and do nothing about that. And the world to accept that is an acceptable way to behave. And you asked earlier on, what could we have some constructive solutions? Now you know what the Palestinian people have been asking for, far less even than some people would ask for, because I believe the whole apartheid system should be dismantled. But what they've asked for is to lift the siege of Gaza. Just to lift the siege of Gaza, let them have an airport, let them have ports, let them not be dictated to by a government for whom they do not vote, as to what can go in and out of their territories, whether they will have power, whether they will have clean water, whether they will have medicine. What makes you think you're allowed to have nuclear weapons and the fourth biggest army in the world and visit destruction on the people of Gaza, but they have no rights to defend themselves. They have no territory. Which mass pestins please tell us how do you justify that? How do you justify those double standards? And very lastly, very lastly, ambassador. People like Bishop Tutu, Nelson Mandela, and I've been certainly described your state as a apartheid state, with different laws for people depending on their race or religion. Now, isn't that just the case? That for example, checkpoints going into the West Bank, there's a channel if you're Israeli or European and as a channel if you're Arab. Just because you're Arab, if you came into the whole era and they stopped you and said, are you Jewish? Oh no, sir, you can't come in through the same entrance as Irish people or European people because you're Jewish, you would call that racism and apartheid.

That's right, the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat shook the hand of the Israeli prime minister Yisra Krabim in front of the entire world and they agreed on peace in the Middle East. It happened 30 years ago in 1993. No one invited both sides to Oslo and they started negotiating. For the first time Palestine recognized Israel and Israel recognized Palestine. They started working out on the details, orders, refugees, business between the two countries, security for both the Israelis and the Palestinians. It was going so well they signed another peace treaty in 1995. Yasser Arafat received together the Nobel Peace Prize. For everybody around the world that was it, peace was on the way until something terrible happened. An extremist in Israel took the life of the Israeli prime minister, then Palestinian extremists jumped on the occasion and started terror attacks to cause more chaos. This trust between both sides started rising and eventually the Oslo agreement was put on pause forever. This story is full of sadness but it's also full of hope. It shows that what most Palestinians in Israel these actually want is peace. It's the extremists, the Palestinian extremists and the Israeli extremists who want to destroy everything and who only care about themselves that are responsible for the war. This handshake that happened 30 years ago is proof that Israelis and Palestinians can see eye to eye and respect each other. It's proof that there are people who believe a Palestinian state and an Israeli state can exist together. It's proof that peace is possible in the Middle East.",subjective

The Secretary General of the WIT report covers the period between 19 September and the 7th December. As the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza raises on, 2023 ends as one of the deadliest in the history of this conflict with the situation deteriorating on nearly all fronts. Mr. President, since the end of the written reporting period, hostilities have continued inside Gaza as the Israeli forces advances further into Hanyunis in the southern part of the strip and intensified operation in report in Hamas strongholds in the north. In Jabbalia, a refugee camp and in Shushia'i'yeh neighborhood as well as in Kamal, a WAN hospital intensive Israeli air strikes continue across the strip. Over a thousand more fatalities overwhelmingly Palestinians have taken place. The toll on civilians including women and children remains unbearable. With more than 100 Israeli hostilities still held by Hamas, the Israeli army announced it had retrieved the bodies of three hostages, two front tunnels in Jabbalia, refugee camp and one woman. On 15 December the IDF said that Israeli soldiers has mistakenly shot and killed three hostages in Shushia'i'yeh. Hamas and other militant factions have also continued to indiscriminately fire rocket at areas in southern and central Israel, including a barrage aimed at Jerusalem on 15 December. The delivery of humanitarian aid in the strip continues to face nearly insurmountable challenges and a displacement of an unimaginable scale and active hostilities. The humanitarian response system is on the brink. Delimited steps by Israel, including a low-ing entry of more fuel, food and cooking gas and opening care of Shalom, Karim Abu Salam, Krosi, for the entry of humanitarian supplies or positivity but for sure, or what is needed to address the human catastrophe on the ground. In the northern part of the strip, that remains mostly inaccessible to humanitarian actors due to its insecurity as well as access restrictions imposed by Israel. With the President, in our focus on Gaza, let us not forget that our attention during the first nine months of this year was on a West Bank in crisis, with mounting pressures for settlement activity, which I know more than double to reach a new annual record since 2017. Settler violence increased Palestinian armed attacks. Israeli security forces operation a rapidly deteriorating physical and economic situation and the Palestinian authorities struggling to face these challenges. Most of these trends have continued and intensified. On 8 December, Israeli forces killed six Palestinians, including a 14-year-old child in a local commander in the father affiliated Al-Aqsa-Mahdi Brigade during operations in Al-Fara'a refugee camp, which led to exchanges of fire with armed Palestinians. Over 12 to 14 and 16 to 17 December, two large-scale Israeli operations took place in Genine refugee camp and in Turkram respectively. The operations, including exchange of fire with armed Palestinians, Israeli toll strikes and search operations. In Turkram, the way extensive infrastructure damage from IDF bulldozers, 17 Palestinians were killed and dozens were arrested. The Palestinian authorities' physical situation continued to be extremely precarious, amidst broader economic concerns across the West Bank. Some 150,000 Palestinian workers have been unable to reach their jobs since Israeli post-Strict and free restrictions following the 7 October attacks. Mr President, I remain concerned about the wide impact of the war in gas and the risk for escalation in the region. Data exchanges of fire across the blue line have continued with the risk of miscalculation and escalation, forcing a grave threat to regional stability. It is imperative that Lebanon will not be dragged into regional conflagration and that the parties return to the cessation of hostilities under the framework of resolution 1701. Meanwhile, in the Red Sea, the goodies in Yemen have tied numerous vessels by border parties as well as by armed drones and missiles. Strikes have damaged a number of ships and other interdicted by the U.S. and other naval forces in the area, raising concerns of the safety of shipping through the vital trade artery. Four major shipping companies have reportedly directed a vessel not to transit through the Red Sea while its radius, a lab port has reported an 80% drop in revenue since attacks again. Mr President, I will not turn to several observations regarding the implementation of the provision on security council resolution 2334 during reporting period. The violence that has taken place since 7 October in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, particularly in and around Gaza has shaken the region and most tragically the lives of millions of Palestinians and its railings. The violence has taken strongly, I strongly condemn, the abhorrent armed attacks by Hamas and others in Israel. Nothing can justify the acts of terror that were committed at the deliberate killing, maybe an abduction of civilians and other protective persons. Accounts of the attacks reveal acts of brutality that are impossible to accept and comprehend. I am appalled by the report of sexual violence during the attacks. This must be vigorously investigated and prosecuted. The indiscriminate firing of rockets towards the Israeli population center which continue to this day is a violation of international humanitarian law and must cease completely. I welcome the release of 110 Israeli anti-Tradian foreign hostages and reiterate that all remaining hostages must be immediately and unconditionally released in line with UN Security Council resolution 2712. The magnitude of hostilities between Israel and Hamas and the scope of death and destruction in Gaza have been unprecedented and unbearable to witness. I unequivocally condemn the killing of civilians in Gaza including women and children. I mull the loss of every civilians including 131 UN colleagues, the single largest loss of life in the history of the organization. I remain gravely concerned by the impact of the ongoing hostilities on the humanitarian situation in Gaza. The current conditions are making it impossible for meaning for humanitarian operations to be conducted. I m also deeply concerned by escalating tensions in the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem. Intensified armed exchanges between Palestinians and the Israeli security forces predominantly in the context of Israeli operations have led to exceedingly high levels of fatalities and arrests. I reiterate that security forces must exercise maximum restraints and use lethal force only when it's quickly unavoidable to protect life. I am alarmed by the lethal attacks carried out by Israeli settlers against Palestinians and by Palestinians against the Israelis in the occupied West Bank and Israel. All perpetrators of violence must be held accountable and swiftly brought to justice. I am pulled by the new presumed instances of officials glorifying violence and encouraging the killing of civilians. Such rhetoric is abhorrent and must be clearly rejected by leaders on all sides. Leaders have an obligation to clearly and explicitly condemn acts of terror and violence directed against civilians. I remain deeply troubled by the relentless expansion of Israel as settlements in the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem that is impeding access to Palestinians to their land and resources and threatening the viability of a future independent Palestinian state. I reiterate that Israeli settlements constitute a flagrant violation of UN resolutions and international law and call on the government of Israel to seize the advancement of all settlement activity immediately. Mr President, this war has once again served as a devastating and tragic reminder that there is no substitute for legitimate political process that will result the core issues driving the conflict. It is critical that this important junction to enable the parties to re-engage or the long delay political path to a two-state solution. I urge Israelis Palestinians to stay",subjective

I try to not talk actually that much about what's happening in the Middle East on social media because the level of a conversation on social media about the Middle East is almost always terrible and infantile, always side blaming. And I tend to like to be constructive, which is not what social media is usually about. So how can anyone be constructive about what's happening during this Israel Hamas war and what's going to happen in Rafa? The war is a huge human tragedy. Everyone knew beforehand that it would be a huge human tragedy and no, it is not genocide. It is a war in an urban area. Everyone knew that there would be tragic loss of human innocent life. And I personally, partly because of that, was not in favor of this invasion, but I also understood why it was taking place. The Israeli people overwhelmingly wanted Hamas eliminated taken out by the root. And in this war, a battle in Rafa was inevitable. So where do we go from here? Well, right now there is active and productive. I know people would say no, it's not productive, but it is negotiation taking place to establish a temporary. And yeah, it will likely be temporary ceasefire. It's a ceasefire that everyone needs Palestinians need aid. Israel needs some hostages return. They should have all of them return. And yeah, Hamas is planning on what to do next. It needs time for that planning. And my guess, and I think it's a good guess, is that there will be a ceasefire because all parties need it. And then likely there will be a battle in Rafa. Six weeks time will allow many Palestinians to leave Rafa and Hamas will lose that battle. I hope quickly. And after that, there will be more negotiations. And I don't know what will happen as a result of those, but I do know that there are major parties working for peace in the region. Saudis, United States, they're going to be squeezing both Israel and Palestine. I hope for the good of all people in their region that they succeed.",subjective

And if you read that panel discussion, I'm sure you'll be like me, you'll come with your biases and find things you agree with and things you go, how could they say that? That's what makes that panel discussion so good. Am I bias? Everyone knows is Israel, right? That's where most of my family lives. But I do want peace. I want this horrific fighting to stop this month's fighting and fighting forever. And reading that panel discussion I was left with the impression that peace will come between Israel and Palestine only when both sides are weak and exhausted. And you may think I am delusional, but we are getting to the point where both sides are weak and completely exhausted. Israel is in fact weaker now than any time in my lifetime. It is weaker and less secure than it has been since 1948. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis have had to leave their border towns because they're no longer safe. That's never happened before. And today's existential enemy for Israel, and it is existential, is not really Hamas or the Palestinians, it's Iran and all the Iranian proxies, including Hamas. Iran and its proxies want to annihilate Israel and they are strong. And this war between Israel and Hamas probably would have already spread further, if not for the help of the United States, which is strategically bombing Iranian proxy targets in Iraq and elsewhere. Israel can no longer do it alone. And when this war ends, Hamas will be gone from governance, but Hamas will still be present in Gaza and Iran will still be a potent force trying to annihilate Israel. When this war ends, Israel will be weak and exhausted. I'm not happy about that. That's just the way it is. And when this war ends, Palestine will be weak and exhausted. About one-third of its populace will be living in rubble. And thousands of innocent civilians, Israeli, Palestinian, will have died. And if it's true that peace is really only possible in this region when both sides are weak and exhausted, it will be the best opportunity for peace. I'm not saying it's going to happen, but it will be the best opportunity for peace in the Middle East in 20 years.",subjective

Thanks, Senator Rush. Okay, Deputy Baibar. Ambassador, I will say frankly, I'm one of the people who thinks you should be expelled from this country and I believe that that's nothing to do with you personally. It's to do with the policies of your state and I think along with Desmond Tutu that the time for treason use in normal state is over because you're not behaving as a normal state and I just want to ask you questions really in relation to us contention and I would just say for the record. It certainly isn't motivated by antisemitism in my case. For example, when disgraceful attempts were being made to downplay the horrors of the Holocaust by people like Dave Irving, I brought Jewish outfits of our diverse city to organize meetings and get around national television to remind the Irish people about the horrors of the Holocaust and I would do so again if anybody tried to downplay the horrors of what were done to the Jewish people. But it is precisely because I'm opposed to racism and I oppose what your state is doing and what it stands for. So I just want to ask you a few questions in relation to that. I'm going to also say by the way I lived for a year, a motion at Nihoti, Nihoti Agi Kar in the Dead Sea in 1987, two weeks before the first intefat of rope-out. That leads me to my first question. You have tried to cover over what you have done, the killings of innocent people and gars and have three separatications over recent years, the seizure of Palestinian land and so on by attacking Hamas. And why don't you just admit that Hamas didn't exist when the first intfat took place. They didn't set up an armed wing until the early 1990s and there was a reason that P. L. O. in Tunis at the time exiled, effectively not present. But the ordinary Palestinians rose up because you denied them basic rights. I lived there. It was apartheid, was racism, was endemic, was rotten. Absolutely I was shocked within weeks of living there to see how you treated Palestinian people. And isn't it the fact that the law of return, which is the basic law of the Israeli state, is a racist apartheid law because it confers rights on Jews that it denies to Palestinians? It allows, for example, if I was Jewish and had never stepped foot in Israel, I could claim citizenship there tomorrow, but six million people whose origins are in what you now call Israel, who were forced out in 1947 or 1948 to not have that right. Isn't that part of the reason by the Palestinians are in dispute with Israelis? Because you denied them the right to return to their homes and to their land and to their villages. And today have a legitimate claim, even under international law, to return, but you denied them that right. Why do you deny them that right? And why do you give that right to other people who have no connection whatsoever with the land, whether you call it Israel or whether you call it Palestine? Why do you continue to seize land if you're serious about Oslo and the two state solution? Why do you continue to seize land which under that agreement is land designated to be Palestinian land? Five hundred thousand people, most of which has taken place since Oslo, you allow that to happen. Why do you allow it to happen if you're serious about giving this land to the Palestinians? It's absolutely extraordinary. And it just, are you not just taking us ambassador for ideas that you can say with a straight face, we're serious about peace, but while we're serious about peace, we're going to seize Palestinian land. And you expect the Palestinians to sit back and do nothing about that. And the world to accept that is an acceptable way to behave. And you asked earlier on, what could we have some constructive solutions? Now you know what the Palestinian people have been asking for, far less even than some people would ask for, because I believe the whole apartheid system should be dismantled. But what they've asked for is to lift the siege of Gaza. Just to lift the siege of Gaza, let them have an airport, let them have ports, let them not be dictated to by a government for whom they do not vote, as to what can go in and out of their territories, whether they will have power, whether they will have clean water, whether they will have medicine.

Just because you're Arab, if you came into the whole era and they stopped you and said, are you Jewish? Oh no, sir, you can't come in through the same entrance as Irish people or European people because you're Jewish, you would call that racism and apartheid.

That's right, the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat shook the hand of the Israeli prime minister Yisra Krabim in front of the entire world and they agreed on peace in the Middle East. It happened 30 years ago in 1993. No one invited both sides to Oslo and they started negotiating. For the first time Palestine recognized Israel and Israel recognized Palestine. They started working out on the details, orders, refugees, business between the two countries, security for both the Israelis and the Palestinians. It was going so well they signed another peace treaty in 1995. Yasser Arafat received together the Nobel Peace Prize. For everybody around the world that was it, peace was on the way until something terrible happened. An extremist in Israel took the life of the Israeli prime minister, then Palestinian extremists jumped on the occasion and started terror attacks to cause more chaos. This trust between both sides started rising and eventually the Oslo agreement was put on pause forever. This story is full of sadness but it's also full of hope. It shows that what most Palestinians in Israel these actually want is peace. It's the extremists, the Palestinian extremists and the Israeli extremists who want to destroy everything and who only care about themselves that are responsible for the war.

The Secretary General of the WIT report covers the period between 19 September and the 7th December. As the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza raises on, 2023 ends as one of the deadliest in the history of this conflict with the situation deteriorating on nearly all fronts. Mr. President, since the end of the written reporting period, hostilities have continued inside Gaza as the Israeli forces advances further into Hanyunis in the southern part of the strip and intensified operation in report in Hamas strongholds in the north. In Jabbalia, a refugee camp and in Shushia'i'yeh neighborhood as well as in Kamal, a WAN hospital intensive Israeli air strikes continue across the strip. Over a thousand more fatalities overwhelmingly Palestinians have taken place. The toll on civilians including women and children remains unbearable. With more than 100 Israeli hostilities still held by Hamas, the Israeli army announced it had retrieved the bodies of three hostages, two front tunnels in Jabbalia, refugee camp and one woman. On 15 December the IDF said that Israeli soldiers has mistakenly shot and killed three hostages in Shushia'i'yeh. Hamas and other militant factions have also continued to indiscriminately fire rocket at areas in southern and central Israel, including a barrage aimed at Jerusalem on 15 December. The delivery of humanitarian aid in the strip continues to face nearly insurmountable challenges and a displacement of an unimaginable scale and active hostilities. The humanitarian response system is on the brink. Delimited steps by Israel, including a low-ing entry of more fuel, food and cooking gas and opening care of Shalom, Karim Abu Salam, Krosi, for the entry of humanitarian supplies or positivity but for sure, or what is needed to address the human catastrophe on the ground. In the northern part of the strip, that remains mostly inaccessible to humanitarian actors due to its insecurity as well as access restrictions imposed by Israel. With the President, in our focus on Gaza, let us not forget that our attention during the first nine months of this year was on a West Bank in crisis, with mounting pressures for settlement activity, which I know more than double to reach a new annual record since 2017. Settler violence increased Palestinian armed attacks. Israeli security forces operation a rapidly deteriorating physical and economic situation and the Palestinian authorities struggling to face these challenges. Most of these trends have continued and intensified. On 8 December, Israeli forces killed six Palestinians, including a 14-year-old child in a local commander in the father affiliated Al-Aqsa-Mahdi Brigade during operations in Al-Fara'a refugee camp, which led to exchanges of fire with armed Palestinians. Over 12 to 14 and 16 to 17 December, two large-scale Israeli operations took place in Genine refugee camp and in Turkram respectively. The operations, including exchange of fire with armed Palestinians, Israeli toll strikes and search operations. In Turkram, the way extensive infrastructure damage from IDF bulldozers, 17 Palestinians were killed and dozens were arrested. The Palestinian authorities' physical situation continued to be extremely precarious, amidst broader economic concerns across the West Bank. Some 150,000 Palestinian workers have been unable to reach their jobs since Israeli post-Strict and free restrictions following the 7 October attacks. Mr President, I remain concerned about the wide impact of the war in gas and the risk for escalation in the region. Data exchanges of fire across the blue line have continued with the risk of miscalculation and escalation, forcing a grave threat to regional stability. It is imperative that Lebanon will not be dragged into regional conflagration and that the parties return to the cessation of hostilities under the framework of resolution 1701. Meanwhile, in the Red Sea, the goodies in Yemen have tied numerous vessels by border parties as well as by armed drones and missiles. Strikes have damaged a number of ships and other interdicted by the U.S. and other naval forces in the area, raising concerns of the safety of shipping through the vital trade artery. Four major shipping companies have reportedly directed a vessel not to transit through the Red Sea while its radius, a lab port has reported an 80% drop in revenue since attacks again. Mr President, I will not turn to several observations regarding the implementation of the provision on security council resolution 2334 during reporting period. The violence that has taken place since 7 October in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, particularly in and around Gaza has shaken the region and most tragically the lives of millions of Palestinians and its railings. The violence has taken strongly, I strongly condemn, the abhorrent armed attacks by Hamas and others in Israel. Nothing can justify the acts of terror that were committed at the deliberate killing, maybe an abduction of civilians and other protective persons. Accounts of the attacks reveal acts of brutality that are impossible to accept and comprehend. I am appalled by the report of sexual violence during the attacks. This must be vigorously investigated and prosecuted. The indiscriminate firing of rockets towards the Israeli population center which continue to this day is a violation of international humanitarian law and must cease completely. I welcome the release of 110 Israeli anti-Tradian foreign hostages and reiterate that all remaining hostages must be immediately and unconditionally released in line with UN Security Council resolution 2712. The magnitude of hostilities between Israel and Hamas and the scope of death and destruction in Gaza have been unprecedented and unbearable to witness. I unequivocally condemn the killing of civilians in Gaza including women and children. I mull the loss of every civilians including 131 UN colleagues, the single largest loss of life in the history of the organization. I remain gravely concerned by the impact of the ongoing hostilities on the humanitarian situation in Gaza. The current conditions are making it impossible for meaning for humanitarian operations to be conducted. I m also deeply concerned by escalating tensions in the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem. Intensified armed exchanges between Palestinians and the Israeli security forces predominantly in the context of Israeli operations have led to exceedingly high levels of fatalities and arrests. I reiterate that security forces must exercise maximum restraints and use lethal force only when it's quickly unavoidable to protect life. I am alarmed by the lethal attacks carried out by Israeli settlers against Palestinians and by Palestinians against the Israelis in the occupied West Bank and Israel. All perpetrators of violence must be held accountable and swiftly brought to justice. I am pulled by the new presumed instances of officials glorifying violence and encouraging the killing of civilians. Such rhetoric is abhorrent and must be clearly rejected by leaders on all sides. Leaders have an obligation to clearly and explicitly condemn acts of terror and violence directed against civilians. I remain deeply troubled by the relentless expansion of Israel as settlements in the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem that is impeding access to Palestinians to their land and resources and threatening the viability of a future independent Palestinian state. I reiterate that Israeli settlements constitute a flagrant violation of UN resolutions and international law and call on the government of Israel to seize the advancement of all settlement activity immediately. Mr President, this war has once again served as a devastating and tragic reminder that there is no substitute for legitimate political process that will result the core issues driving the conflict. It is critical that this important junction to enable the parties to re-engage or the long delay political path to a two-state solution. I urge Israelis Palestinians to stay",subjective

I try to not talk actually that much about what's happening in the Middle East on social media because the level of a conversation on social media about the Middle East is almost always terrible and infantile, always side blaming. And I tend to like to be constructive, which is not what social media is usually about. So how can anyone be constructive about what's happening during this Israel Hamas war and what's going to happen in Rafa? The war is a huge human tragedy. Everyone knew beforehand that it would be a huge human tragedy and no, it is not genocide. It is a war in an urban area. Everyone knew that there would be tragic loss of human innocent life. And I personally, partly because of that, was not in favor of this invasion, but I also understood why it was taking place. The Israeli people overwhelmingly wanted Hamas eliminated taken out by the root. And in this war, a battle in Rafa was inevitable. So where do we go from here? Well, right now there is active and productive. I know people would say no, it's not productive, but it is negotiation taking place to establish a temporary. And yeah, it will likely be temporary ceasefire. It's a ceasefire that everyone needs Palestinians need aid. Israel needs some hostages return. They should have all of them return. And yeah, Hamas is planning on what to do next. It needs time for that planning. And my guess, and I think it's a good guess, is that there will be a ceasefire because all parties need it. And then likely there will be a battle in Rafa. Six weeks time will allow many Palestinians to leave Rafa and Hamas will lose that battle. I hope quickly. And after that, there will be more negotiations. And I don't know what will happen as a result of those, but I do know that there are major parties working for peace in the region. Saudis, United States, they're going to be squeezing both Israel and Palestine. I hope for the good of all people in their region that they succeed.",subjective

It's to do with the policies of your state. And I think along with Desmond Tutu that the time for treason you as a normal state is over because you're not behaving as a normal state. And I just want to ask you questions really in relation to that contention. And I would just say for the record, it certainly isn't motivated by antisemitism in my case. I mean for example when disgraceful attempts were being made to downplay the horrors of the Holocaust by people like David Irving, I brought Jewish outshmits survivor to this city to organize meetings and get around national television to remind the Irish people about the horrors of the Holocaust. And I would do so again if anybody tried to downplay the horrors of what were done to the Jewish people. And it is precisely because I'm opposed to racism that I oppose what your state is doing and what it stands for. So I just want to ask you a few questions in relation to that. And I should also say by the way I lived for a year a much of a new year, a new year to a haki car in the Dead Sea in 1987, two weeks before the first intifada broke out. That leads me to my first question. You have tried to cover over what you have done, the killings of innocent people in Gaza and three separatications over recent years, the seizure of Palestinian land and so on by attacking Hamas. Now why don't you just admit that Hamas didn't exist when the first intifada took place? They didn't set up an armed wing until the early 1990s. And there was a reason that P. L. O. in Tunis at the time exiled, effectively not present. But the ordinary Palestinians rose up because you denied them basic rights. I lived there. It was apartheid, was racism, was endemic, was rotten. Absolutely I was shocked within weeks of living there to see how you treated Palestinian people. And isn't it the fact that the law of return, which is the basic law of the Israeli state, is a racist apartheid law because it confers rights on Jews that it denies to Palestinians? It allows for example, if I was Jewish and I'd never stepped foot in Israel, I could claim citizenship there tomorrow, but six million people whose origins are in what you now call Israel, who were forced out in 1947 or 1948 to not have that right. Isn't that part of the reason by the Palestinians earned this bill with Israelis? Because you denied them the right to return to their homes and to their land and to their villages.

This all changed with the suicide bombing of a bus full of Israeli children in Jerusalem on the 19th, both Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility, and so Israel attempted to assassinate their leadership and those responsible, killing and wounding bystanders in the process. These factions of Palestinian hardliners, who were never committed anyway, soon officially ended their participation in the ceasefire and declared themselves enemies of the peace plan. This in turn forced the recently appointed prime minister Mahmoud Abbas into the politically awkward position of cracking down on his fellow Palestinians in order to maintain his part of the peace deal.

And the Middle Eastern States and Palestine need to accept the fact that there were many, many situations where Israel was just attacked again and again and again and whether it should have or not, it got us to the point where Israel's form of defense is continuing this problem. And if pro-Palestinians keep blaming Israel and pro-Israeli's keep blaming Palestine and the Middle Eastern States, then we are not going to get any farther. We are just going to continually keep going in a circle. Take a look at World War II. One of the most amazing things that has gone on since World War II is Germany taking responsibility for what their people did to the point that they actually teach their kids consistently, yearly, about what happened and how Germany was responsible for it. In fact, if you look at the whole world, the one country that is still pretty much in some way, shape, or form, in conflict with the rest of the world is the one that doesn't really take responsibility for their part. And that's Russia because whether they're willing to accept it or not, Russia was at access power to start. And finally, let's look at America. I think one of the biggest reasons that we are where we are in this country is we have people, politicians, political sides, it doesn't matter that aren't willing to take responsibility for what they do, what they say. All they do is put blame on the other side, the other party. And until everyone's willing to take responsibility for what they say and do and stop pointing fingers at other people, we will continue to be in conflict. Nobody's perfect. Humans make mistakes, humans do bad things. It's what we do in response to doing all of those things that actually decides whether or not there can be peace. If we want to start having peace in the Middle East or in the United States, the first step is everyone taking responsibility for their part in the problem. And then the next step is figuring out how we can work together with our differences as a society, as a country, as a world.",subjective

That's what makes that panel discussion so good. Am I bias? Everyone knows is Israel, right? That's where most of my family lives. But I do want peace. I want this horrific fighting to stop this month's fighting and fighting forever. And reading that panel discussion I was left with the impression that peace will come between Israel and Palestine only when both sides are weak and exhausted. And you may think I am delusional, but we are getting to the point where both sides are weak and completely exhausted. Israel is in fact weaker now than any time in my lifetime. It is weaker and less secure than it has been since 1948. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis have had to leave their border towns because they're no longer safe. That's never happened before. And today's existential enemy for Israel, and it is existential, is not really Hamas or the Palestinians, it's Iran and all the Iranian proxies, including Hamas. Iran and its proxies want to annihilate Israel and they are strong. And this war between Israel and Hamas probably would have already spread further, if not for the help of the United States, which is strategically bombing Iranian proxy targets in Iraq and elsewhere. Israel can no longer do it alone. And when this war ends, Hamas will be gone from governance, but Hamas will still be present in Gaza and Iran will still be a potent force trying to annihilate Israel. When this war ends, Israel will be weak and exhausted. I'm not happy about that. That's just the way it is. And when this war ends, Palestine will be weak and exhausted. About one-third of its populace will be living in rubble. And thousands of innocent civilians, Israeli, Palestinian, will have died. And if it's true that peace is really only possible in this region when both sides are weak and exhausted, it will be the best opportunity for peace.

Thanks, Senator Rush. Okay, Deputy Baibar. Ambassador, I will say frankly, I'm one of the people who thinks you should be expelled from this country and I believe that that's nothing to do with you personally. It's to do with the policies of your state and I think along with Desmond Tutu that the time for treason use in normal state is over because you're not behaving as a normal state and I just want to ask you questions really in relation to us contention and I would just say for the record. It certainly isn't motivated by antisemitism in my case. For example, when disgraceful attempts were being made to downplay the horrors of the Holocaust by people like Dave Irving, I brought Jewish outfits of our diverse city to organize meetings and get around national television to remind the Irish people about the horrors of the Holocaust and I would do so again if anybody tried to downplay the horrors of what were done to the Jewish people. But it is precisely because I'm opposed to racism and I oppose what your state is doing and what it stands for. So I just want to ask you a few questions in relation to that. I'm going to also say by the way I lived for a year, a motion at Nihoti, Nihoti Agi Kar in the Dead Sea in 1987, two weeks before the first intefat of rope-out. That leads me to my first question. You have tried to cover over what you have done, the killings of innocent people and gars and have three separatications over recent years, the seizure of Palestinian land and so on by attacking Hamas. And why don't you just admit that Hamas didn't exist when the first intfat took place. They didn't set up an armed wing until the early 1990s and there was a reason that P. L. O. in Tunis at the time exiled, effectively not present. But the ordinary Palestinians rose up because you denied them basic rights. I lived there. It was apartheid, was racism, was endemic, was rotten. Absolutely I was shocked within weeks of living there to see how you treated Palestinian people. And isn't it the fact that the law of return, which is the basic law of the Israeli state, is a racist apartheid law because it confers rights on Jews that it denies to Palestinians? It allows, for example, if I was Jewish and had never stepped foot in Israel, I could claim citizenship there tomorrow, but six million people whose origins are in what you now call Israel, who were forced out in 1947 or 1948 to not have that right. Isn't that part of the reason by the Palestinians are in dispute with Israelis? Because you denied them the right to return to their homes and to their land and to their villages. And today have a legitimate claim, even under international law, to return, but you denied them that right. Why do you deny them that right? And why do you give that right to other people who have no connection whatsoever with the land, whether you call it Israel or whether you call it Palestine? Why do you continue to seize land if you're serious about Oslo and the two state solution? Why do you continue to seize land which under that agreement is land designated to be Palestinian land? Five hundred thousand people, most of which has taken place since Oslo, you allow that to happen. Why do you allow it to happen if you're serious about giving this land to the Palestinians? It's absolutely extraordinary. And it just, are you not just taking us ambassador for ideas that you can say with a straight face, we're serious about peace, but while we're serious about peace, we're going to seize Palestinian land. And you expect the Palestinians to sit back and do nothing about that. And the world to accept that is an acceptable way to behave. And you asked earlier on, what could we have some constructive solutions? Now you know what the Palestinian people have been asking for, far less even than some people would ask for, because I believe the whole apartheid system should be dismantled. But what they've asked for is to lift the siege of Gaza. Just to lift the siege of Gaza, let them have an airport, let them have ports, let them not be dictated to by a government for whom they do not vote, as to what can go in and out of their territories, whether they will have power, whether they will have clean water, whether they will have medicine.

Oh no, sir, you can't come in through the same entrance as Irish people or European people because you're Jewish, you would call that racism and apartheid.

It happened 30 years ago in 1993. No one invited both sides to Oslo and they started negotiating. For the first time Palestine recognized Israel and Israel recognized Palestine. They started working out on the details, orders, refugees, business between the two countries, security for both the Israelis and the Palestinians. It was going so well they signed another peace treaty in 1995. Yasser Arafat received together the Nobel Peace Prize. For everybody around the world that was it, peace was on the way until something terrible happened. An extremist in Israel took the life of the Israeli prime minister, then Palestinian extremists jumped on the occasion and started terror attacks to cause more chaos. This trust between both sides started rising and eventually the Oslo agreement was put on pause forever. This story is full of sadness but it's also full of hope. It shows that what most Palestinians in Israel these actually want is peace. It's the extremists, the Palestinian extremists and the Israeli extremists who want to destroy everything and who only care about themselves that are responsible for the war.

The Secretary General of the WIT report covers the period between 19 September and the 7th December. As the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza raises on, 2023 ends as one of the deadliest in the history of this conflict with the situation deteriorating on nearly all fronts. Mr. President, since the end of the written reporting period, hostilities have continued inside Gaza as the Israeli forces advances further into Hanyunis in the southern part of the strip and intensified operation in report in Hamas strongholds in the north. In Jabbalia, a refugee camp and in Shushia'i'yeh neighborhood as well as in Kamal, a WAN hospital intensive Israeli air strikes continue across the strip. Over a thousand more fatalities overwhelmingly Palestinians have taken place. The toll on civilians including women and children remains unbearable. With more than 100 Israeli hostilities still held by Hamas, the Israeli army announced it had retrieved the bodies of three hostages, two front tunnels in Jabbalia, refugee camp and one woman. On 15 December the IDF said that Israeli soldiers has mistakenly shot and killed three hostages in Shushia'i'yeh. Hamas and other militant factions have also continued to indiscriminately fire rocket at areas in southern and central Israel, including a barrage aimed at Jerusalem on 15 December. The delivery of humanitarian aid in the strip continues to face nearly insurmountable challenges and a displacement of an unimaginable scale and active hostilities. The humanitarian response system is on the brink. Delimited steps by Israel, including a low-ing entry of more fuel, food and cooking gas and opening care of Shalom, Karim Abu Salam, Krosi, for the entry of humanitarian supplies or positivity but for sure, or what is needed to address the human catastrophe on the ground. In the northern part of the strip, that remains mostly inaccessible to humanitarian actors due to its insecurity as well as access restrictions imposed by Israel. With the President, in our focus on Gaza, let us not forget that our attention during the first nine months of this year was on a West Bank in crisis, with mounting pressures for settlement activity, which I know more than double to reach a new annual record since 2017. Settler violence increased Palestinian armed attacks. Israeli security forces operation a rapidly deteriorating physical and economic situation and the Palestinian authorities struggling to face these challenges. Most of these trends have continued and intensified. On 8 December, Israeli forces killed six Palestinians, including a 14-year-old child in a local commander in the father affiliated Al-Aqsa-Mahdi Brigade during operations in Al-Fara'a refugee camp, which led to exchanges of fire with armed Palestinians. Over 12 to 14 and 16 to 17 December, two large-scale Israeli operations took place in Genine refugee camp and in Turkram respectively. The operations, including exchange of fire with armed Palestinians, Israeli toll strikes and search operations. In Turkram, the way extensive infrastructure damage from IDF bulldozers, 17 Palestinians were killed and dozens were arrested. The Palestinian authorities' physical situation continued to be extremely precarious, amidst broader economic concerns across the West Bank. Some 150,000 Palestinian workers have been unable to reach their jobs since Israeli post-Strict and free restrictions following the 7 October attacks. Mr President, I remain concerned about the wide impact of the war in gas and the risk for escalation in the region. Data exchanges of fire across the blue line have continued with the risk of miscalculation and escalation, forcing a grave threat to regional stability. It is imperative that Lebanon will not be dragged into regional conflagration and that the parties return to the cessation of hostilities under the framework of resolution 1701. Meanwhile, in the Red Sea, the goodies in Yemen have tied numerous vessels by border parties as well as by armed drones and missiles. Strikes have damaged a number of ships and other interdicted by the U.S. and other naval forces in the area, raising concerns of the safety of shipping through the vital trade artery. Four major shipping companies have reportedly directed a vessel not to transit through the Red Sea while its radius, a lab port has reported an 80% drop in revenue since attacks again. Mr President, I will not turn to several observations regarding the implementation of the provision on security council resolution 2334 during reporting period. The violence that has taken place since 7 October in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, particularly in and around Gaza has shaken the region and most tragically the lives of millions of Palestinians and its railings. The violence has taken strongly, I strongly condemn, the abhorrent armed attacks by Hamas and others in Israel. Nothing can justify the acts of terror that were committed at the deliberate killing, maybe an abduction of civilians and other protective persons. Accounts of the attacks reveal acts of brutality that are impossible to accept and comprehend. I am appalled by the report of sexual violence during the attacks. This must be vigorously investigated and prosecuted. The indiscriminate firing of rockets towards the Israeli population center which continue to this day is a violation of international humanitarian law and must cease completely. I welcome the release of 110 Israeli anti-Tradian foreign hostages and reiterate that all remaining hostages must be immediately and unconditionally released in line with UN Security Council resolution 2712. The magnitude of hostilities between Israel and Hamas and the scope of death and destruction in Gaza have been unprecedented and unbearable to witness. I unequivocally condemn the killing of civilians in Gaza including women and children. I mull the loss of every civilians including 131 UN colleagues, the single largest loss of life in the history of the organization. I remain gravely concerned by the impact of the ongoing hostilities on the humanitarian situation in Gaza. The current conditions are making it impossible for meaning for humanitarian operations to be conducted. I m also deeply concerned by escalating tensions in the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem. Intensified armed exchanges between Palestinians and the Israeli security forces predominantly in the context of Israeli operations have led to exceedingly high levels of fatalities and arrests. I reiterate that security forces must exercise maximum restraints and use lethal force only when it's quickly unavoidable to protect life. I am alarmed by the lethal attacks carried out by Israeli settlers against Palestinians and by Palestinians against the Israelis in the occupied West Bank and Israel. All perpetrators of violence must be held accountable and swiftly brought to justice. I am pulled by the new presumed instances of officials glorifying violence and encouraging the killing of civilians. Such rhetoric is abhorrent and must be clearly rejected by leaders on all sides. Leaders have an obligation to clearly and explicitly condemn acts of terror and violence directed against civilians. I remain deeply troubled by the relentless expansion of Israel as settlements in the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem that is impeding access to Palestinians to their land and resources and threatening the viability of a future independent Palestinian state. I reiterate that Israeli settlements constitute a flagrant violation of UN resolutions and international law and call on the government of Israel to seize the advancement of all settlement activity immediately. Mr President, this war has once again served as a devastating and tragic reminder that there is no substitute for legitimate political process that will result the core issues driving the conflict. It is critical that this important junction to enable the parties to re-engage or the long delay political path to a two-state solution. I urge Israelis Palestinians to stay",subjective

I try to not talk actually that much about what's happening in the Middle East on social media because the level of a conversation on social media about the Middle East is almost always terrible and infantile, always side blaming. And I tend to like to be constructive, which is not what social media is usually about. So how can anyone be constructive about what's happening during this Israel Hamas war and what's going to happen in Rafa? The war is a huge human tragedy. Everyone knew beforehand that it would be a huge human tragedy and no, it is not genocide. It is a war in an urban area. Everyone knew that there would be tragic loss of human innocent life. And I personally, partly because of that, was not in favor of this invasion, but I also understood why it was taking place. The Israeli people overwhelmingly wanted Hamas eliminated taken out by the root. And in this war, a battle in Rafa was inevitable. So where do we go from here? Well, right now there is active and productive. I know people would say no, it's not productive, but it is negotiation taking place to establish a temporary. And yeah, it will likely be temporary ceasefire. It's a ceasefire that everyone needs Palestinians need aid. Israel needs some hostages return. They should have all of them return. And yeah, Hamas is planning on what to do next. It needs time for that planning. And my guess, and I think it's a good guess, is that there will be a ceasefire because all parties need it. And then likely there will be a battle in Rafa. Six weeks time will allow many Palestinians to leave Rafa and Hamas will lose that battle. I hope quickly. And after that, there will be more negotiations. And I don't know what will happen as a result of those, but I do know that there are major parties working for peace in the region. Saudis, United States, they're going to be squeezing both Israel and Palestine. I hope for the good of all people in their region that they succeed.",subjective

It's to do with the policies of your state. And I think along with Desmond Tutu that the time for treason you as a normal state is over because you're not behaving as a normal state. And I just want to ask you questions really in relation to that contention. And I would just say for the record, it certainly isn't motivated by antisemitism in my case. I mean for example when disgraceful attempts were being made to downplay the horrors of the Holocaust by people like David Irving, I brought Jewish outshmits survivor to this city to organize meetings and get around national television to remind the Irish people about the horrors of the Holocaust. And I would do so again if anybody tried to downplay the horrors of what were done to the Jewish people. And it is precisely because I'm opposed to racism that I oppose what your state is doing and what it stands for. So I just want to ask you a few questions in relation to that. And I should also say by the way I lived for a year a much of a new year, a new year to a haki car in the Dead Sea in 1987, two weeks before the first intifada broke out. That leads me to my first question. You have tried to cover over what you have done, the killings of innocent people in Gaza and three separatications over recent years, the seizure of Palestinian land and so on by attacking Hamas. Now why don't you just admit that Hamas didn't exist when the first intifada took place? They didn't set up an armed wing until the early 1990s. And there was a reason that P. L. O. in Tunis at the time exiled, effectively not present. But the ordinary Palestinians rose up because you denied them basic rights. I lived there. It was apartheid, was racism, was endemic, was rotten. Absolutely I was shocked within weeks of living there to see how you treated Palestinian people. And isn't it the fact that the law of return, which is the basic law of the Israeli state, is a racist apartheid law because it confers rights on Jews that it denies to Palestinians? It allows for example, if I was Jewish and I'd never stepped foot in Israel, I could claim citizenship there tomorrow, but six million people whose origins are in what you now call Israel, who were forced out in 1947 or 1948 to not have that right. Isn't that part of the reason by the Palestinians earned this bill with Israelis? Because you denied them the right to return to their homes and to their land and to their villages.

This all changed with the suicide bombing of a bus full of Israeli children in Jerusalem on the 19th, both Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility, and so Israel attempted to assassinate their leadership and those responsible, killing and wounding bystanders in the process.

Behind the wall are the trees she planted and can no longer reach. People in the world wake up agitated from a bad nightmare, but here we are awake and are agitated every single day. The Israeli separation barrier cuts through her family's land in Katanna village, New Jerusalem. I heard the diggers working and saw them uprooting the trees. It was a deep pain in my heart. They didn't care when I lost the trees that I carried on my shoulders and planted one by one. That gets later Israeli forces are back for more. In August they handed several families in Katanna new confiscation orders to expand the wall. They fear that Israel will use the war on Gaza to grab more lands. This is our land and we have the proof. They say you're close to the illegal Israeli settlement, but I was here before the wall. The courts and power are in their hands. My future is over. I fear now for my children and grandchildren's future. Israel started building the wall during the second Palestinian uprising known as the Intifada. Palestinians say Israel used security as an excuse to confiscate more land. The wall's length is more than double that of the 1967 borders, snaking into Palestinian territory, running as deep as 18 kilometers inside the occupied West Bank. The UN says it's almost complete and will take up around 10 percent of Palestinian lands. The international court of justice has ruled the wall is illegal. Roads like this one are all what's left for Palestinians who often have to take longer routes to reach their destinations. For Palestinians the wall is an extension of Israel's system of control. Out of a wider network of roads, settlements and checkpoints built to give Israelis the upper hand while making their lives unbearable by the day.

Het plaatsen van de divider was super easy. De lengte van een divider 280 cm en je zaagt ze zelf op de gewenste maat.  PS wij kozen voor een afwerking in naturel eiken fineer.

Behind the wall are the trees she planted and can no longer reach. People in the world wake up agitated from a bad nightmare, but here we are awake and are agitated every single day. The Israeli separation barrier cuts through her family's land in Katanna village, New Jerusalem. I heard the diggers working and saw them uprooting the trees. It was a deep pain in my heart. They didn't care when I lost the trees that I carried on my shoulders and planted one by one. That gets later Israeli forces are back for more. In August they handed several families in Katanna new confiscation orders to expand the wall. They fear that Israel will use the war on Gaza to grab more lands. This is our land and we have the proof. They say you're close to the illegal Israeli settlement, but I was here before the wall. The courts and power are in their hands. My future is over. I fear now for my children and grandchildren's future. Israel started building the wall during the second Palestinian uprising known as the Intifada. Palestinians say Israel used security as an excuse to confiscate more land. The wall's length is more than double that of the 1967 borders, snaking into Palestinian territory, running as deep as 18 kilometers inside the occupied West Bank. The UN says it's almost complete and will take up around 10 percent of Palestinian lands. The international court of justice has ruled the wall is illegal. Roads like this one are all what's left for Palestinians who often have to take longer routes to reach their destinations. For Palestinians the wall is an extension of Israel's system of control. Out of a wider network of roads, settlements and checkpoints built to give Israelis the upper hand while making their lives unbearable by the day.

Behind the wall are the trees she planted and can no longer reach. People in the world wake up agitated from a bad nightmare, but here we are awake and are agitated every single day. The Israeli separation barrier cuts through her family's land in Katanna village, New Jerusalem. I heard the diggers working and saw them uprooting the trees. It was a deep pain in my heart. They didn't care when I lost the trees that I carried on my shoulders and planted one by one. That gets later Israeli forces are back for more. In August they handed several families in Katanna new confiscation orders to expand the wall. They fear that Israel will use the war on Gaza to grab more lands. This is our land and we have the proof. They say you're close to the illegal Israeli settlement, but I was here before the wall. The courts and power are in their hands. My future is over. I fear now for my children and grandchildren's future. Israel started building the wall during the second Palestinian uprising known as the Intifada. Palestinians say Israel used security as an excuse to confiscate more land. The wall's length is more than double that of the 1967 borders, snaking into Palestinian territory, running as deep as 18 kilometers inside the occupied West Bank. The UN says it's almost complete and will take up around 10 percent of Palestinian lands. The international court of justice has ruled the wall is illegal. Roads like this one are all what's left for Palestinians who often have to take longer routes to reach their destinations. For Palestinians the wall is an extension of Israel's system of control. Out of a wider network of roads, settlements and checkpoints built to give Israelis the upper hand while making their lives unbearable by the day.

There are at least 10 Iron Dome batteries across Israel. They follow the trajectory of rockets, analyze if they're headed to a populated area, and if they are, they fire what are called to near-interceptors to stop the rockets. In 2013, the former CEO of Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, which developed the Iron Dome, told 60 minutes that it was a game changer. It allows Israelis to continue to go to work, even when deadly rockets are being launched at their country. The US helps manufacture Iron Dome components and has access to the technology. It said the Iron Dome has a 90-97% success rate, but it's unclear how successful it's been since Hamas launched its initial attack, which has killed more than 1,500 people in Israel and sparked a war that has killed more than 1,700 people in Gaza.",subjective

The success rate of intercepting a missile is 90 percent, while Hamas fires 5,000 rockets in a 20-minute frenzy. Can the Iron Dome truly defend against such a relentless attack? An Iron Dome anti-air system consists of three key components. This is the Combat Command Center. There's also the Missile Launch Unit. The most critical part is this detection and tracking radar. The Missile Launch Unit can hold up to 20 missiles, deploying it near a city, is like putting a protective shield over the city. The Combat Command Center is responsible for intercepting incoming orders. Attacks are only initiated when rockets enter a designated range. This small interceptor missiles surprisingly can cover a range of 70 kilometers, even though it's only 2.8 meters tall and weighs only 90 kilograms. Now, pay close attention. Here's the key point. When multiple enemy missiles are fired at the target city, the Iron Dome Defense System activates. First, the radar can detect threats within a 100 kilometer radius. Then it transmits the data to the Combat Command System, which sends instructions to the Missile Launch Unit and tracks the trajectory of enemy missiles. Data is transmitted from the radar to the Combat Command Center. Once a target is detected within the protected area, interceptor missiles are rapidly launched and locked on to the target. When they get close enough, the front warhead detonates. Inside, it contains shrapnel that detonates enemy bombs. It's important to note that a single Hamas rocket costs only $80, while intercepting it with an Iron Dome Missile costs $50,000. That's a significant difference in interception costs.",subjective

Israel has 10 of these iron dome batteries, each of which is designed to defend 60 square miles. For a country the size of Israel, that was a long way to cover where many people live. But the US is so much bigger, it would require thousands. More importantly, these focus on relatively basic, short-range projectiles. They likely wouldn't protect against more advanced missiles, fired from far away. Those are a much bigger challenge to stop. But when the US has been investing billions of dollars in for decades. Despite Trump saying, We help other countries, we don't do it for ourselves. On a smaller scale, the US does have two iron dome batteries.

There are at least 10 Iron Dome batteries across Israel. They follow the trajectory of rockets, analyze if they're headed to a populated area, and if they are, they fire what are called to near-interceptors to stop the rockets. In 2013, the former CEO of Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, which developed the Iron Dome, told 60 minutes that it was a game changer. It allows Israelis to continue to go to work, even when deadly rockets are being launched at their country. The US helps manufacture Iron Dome components and has access to the technology. It said the Iron Dome has a 90-97% success rate, but it's unclear how successful it's been since Hamas launched its initial attack, which has killed more than 1,500 people in Israel and sparked a war that has killed more than 1,700 people in Gaza.",subjective

The success rate of intercepting a missile is 90 percent, while Hamas fires 5,000 rockets in a 20-minute frenzy. Can the Iron Dome truly defend against such a relentless attack? An Iron Dome anti-air system consists of three key components. This is the Combat Command Center. There's also the Missile Launch Unit. The most critical part is this detection and tracking radar. The Missile Launch Unit can hold up to 20 missiles, deploying it near a city, is like putting a protective shield over the city. The Combat Command Center is responsible for intercepting incoming orders. Attacks are only initiated when rockets enter a designated range. This small interceptor missiles surprisingly can cover a range of 70 kilometers, even though it's only 2.8 meters tall and weighs only 90 kilograms. Now, pay close attention. Here's the key point. When multiple enemy missiles are fired at the target city, the Iron Dome Defense System activates. First, the radar can detect threats within a 100 kilometer radius. Then it transmits the data to the Combat Command System, which sends instructions to the Missile Launch Unit and tracks the trajectory of enemy missiles. Data is transmitted from the radar to the Combat Command Center. Once a target is detected within the protected area, interceptor missiles are rapidly launched and locked on to the target. When they get close enough, the front warhead detonates. Inside, it contains shrapnel that detonates enemy bombs. It's important to note that a single Hamas rocket costs only $80, while intercepting it with an Iron Dome Missile costs $50,000. That's a significant difference in interception costs.",subjective

Mobile and flexible. The system is highly mobile, allowing it to be deployed quickly to different locations as needed. Its flexibility enables it to adapt to changing threat scenarios. Interception technology. The Iron Dome uses advanced radar systems to track incoming projectiles and determine their trajectory. When a threat is detected, it launches interceptor missiles to destroy the incoming rockets before they reach their targets. Cost-effective defense. Despite its advanced technology, the Iron Dome is often praised for its cost-effectiveness.

It operates automatically around the clock in all weather conditions and works wonders in intercepting and destroying short-range rockets and artillery shells. The system uses advanced optical radar and algorithms to predict the trajectory of incoming projectiles. And in less than a second, it determines whether they pose a threat to densely populated areas. If it detects a threat, it launches an interceptor missile that destroys the incoming projectile in mid-air. For less advanced rockets and mortars, Iron Dome has an intercept success rate of about 75 to 90%. A standard Iron Nest artillery battery usually consists of three or four mobile launching units, each carrying 20 ready-to-fire interceptor missiles. The cost of each interceptor missile is worth about $50,000, while enemy-launched rockets are much cheaper and more plentiful. The high cost also limits the number of ready-to-launch missiles, making precise targeting and interception critical. With one Iron Dome battery protecting a medium-sized city area, the Iron Dome system struggles to achieve 100% interception for intense attacks of short-flight close-range rockets, as well as for cost considerations. Although it provides a sophisticated defense, any system has limitations. As a result, Israel has also developed a multi-layered air defense system to deal with a variety of threats. The Iron Dome air defense system is the innermost layer of Israel's air defense system, and in the middle layer of Israel's air defense system, interceptor systems such as the spear of David play a vital role. This layer is designed to intercept targets such as airplanes, helicopters, and cruise missiles. The outermost layer of the air defense system consists of the arrow-long-range ballistic missile interceptor system, which is used to intercept long-range ballistic missile threats in the upper atmosphere and in space. In addition to the land-based system, Israel deploys the Maritime Iron Dome system, which provides 360-degree coverage of the coastline, and intercepts missiles launched from the sea. This creates a multi-layered air defense network that responds to a wide range of air threats at different ranges.",subjective

There are at least 10 Iron Dome batteries across Israel. They follow the trajectory of rockets, analyze if they're headed to a populated area, and if they are, they fire what are called to near-interceptors to stop the rockets. In 2013, the former CEO of Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, which developed the Iron Dome, told 60 minutes that it was a game changer. It allows Israelis to continue to go to work, even when deadly rockets are being launched at their country. The US helps manufacture Iron Dome components and has access to the technology. It said the Iron Dome has a 90-97% success rate, but it's unclear how successful it's been since Hamas launched its initial attack, which has killed more than 1,500 people in Israel and sparked a war that has killed more than 1,700 people in Gaza.",subjective

The success rate of intercepting a missile is 90 percent, while Hamas fires 5,000 rockets in a 20-minute frenzy. Can the Iron Dome truly defend against such a relentless attack? An Iron Dome anti-air system consists of three key components. This is the Combat Command Center. There's also the Missile Launch Unit. The most critical part is this detection and tracking radar. The Missile Launch Unit can hold up to 20 missiles, deploying it near a city, is like putting a protective shield over the city. The Combat Command Center is responsible for intercepting incoming orders. Attacks are only initiated when rockets enter a designated range. This small interceptor missiles surprisingly can cover a range of 70 kilometers, even though it's only 2.8 meters tall and weighs only 90 kilograms. Now, pay close attention. Here's the key point. When multiple enemy missiles are fired at the target city, the Iron Dome Defense System activates. First, the radar can detect threats within a 100 kilometer radius. Then it transmits the data to the Combat Command System, which sends instructions to the Missile Launch Unit and tracks the trajectory of enemy missiles. Data is transmitted from the radar to the Combat Command Center. Once a target is detected within the protected area, interceptor missiles are rapidly launched and locked on to the target. When they get close enough, the front warhead detonates. Inside, it contains shrapnel that detonates enemy bombs. It's important to note that a single Hamas rocket costs only $80, while intercepting it with an Iron Dome Missile costs $50,000. That's a significant difference in interception costs.",subjective

The Iron Dome has an impressive success rate of intercepting incoming threats. During its deployment, it has reportedly intercepted over 90% of the rockets it targeted. Rapid response. One of its remarkable features is its ability to detect and intercept incoming projectiles within seconds. This quick response time is crucial for protecting populated areas from rocket attacks. Mobile and flexible. The system is highly mobile, allowing it to be deployed quickly to different locations as needed. Its flexibility enables it to adapt to changing threat scenarios. Interception technology. The Iron Dome uses advanced radar systems to track incoming projectiles and determine their trajectory. When a threat is detected, it launches interceptor missiles to destroy the incoming rockets before they reach their targets. Cost-effective defense. Despite its advanced technology, the Iron Dome is often praised for its cost-effectiveness. Intercepting incoming rockets with the Iron Dome is generally less expensive than allowing them to hit their targets, which could result in significant damage and casualties. International interest. The success of the Iron Dome has garnered international interest with several countries expressing interest in acquiring similar defense systems.",subjective

It's been under constant redevelopment since its inception in the early 2000s. It uses radar, it uses command and control systems and it's basically set up so that it intercepts the missiles in mid air, kind of like how a sea ram does for IDF. To give you an idea of how effective it is, over 4,300 rockets were fired from Gaza and Israel in May of 2021. And more than 90% of those rockets were taken down from like using the Iron Dome.

For example, from the West Bank, men have to be aged over 55 and over, women 50 and over, which is the first time they place this restriction. For the faithful, a single prayer inside the Al-Azza compound is worth 500 outside. But there have been tensions recently.

Obviously, Israel's aware of something like that happened, it would cause mayhem in the entire region. For reference, this is not actually all oxomosk, it's this one right over here, but some people get it confused. Instead of destroying it all at once for the world to see, Israel's been taking a very insidious approach and destroying it from the bottom up. Israel's digging underneath the mosque, and they're claiming it's for archaeological excavations. Excavations are destroying the structural integrity of the mosque, and every single time Muslims request build permits to stabilize it, Israel denies it. Structural integrity has become so weak that a stone actually fell from the mosque, and Israeli authorities just moved it away. In the past six months, especially, the structural integrity is very seriously damaged now. Historical was written last year and look how much digging they've done underneath. I don't know if the media is not reporting on it because they don't want Muslims to know, but it's getting really bad, and they're blocking every restoration permit. I think Muslim Americans have the upper hand here because they can actually mobilize politically, try to get resolutions passed, build a portfolio to further sanction Israel for all these crimes they're committing.

But in 2021 and 2022, there's videos of Israel's military going in and disresmecting and lighting off fireworks and other different explosives inside of this mosque.

This is the location where they are supposed to build the third temple to summon the Dejal or the Antichrist. Now they think their Messiah has not came yet and it is going to come in the near future. Every other belief system recognizes Jesus and the teaching and the history surrounding him. But in Israel, they just see him as another dude, in which it's dangerous because within Islam and Christianity, they have an Antichrist or the Dejal.

I would love it if you can describe why it is such an important place, a holy place for Muslims in general, but also for this particular crisis that we have been speaking about today. So Muslims honor the history of all of the prophets. So all of the prophets that have walked in that place, all of the prophets that have worshiped in that place, all of that makes it sacred. So it's not separated from Muslims from post-Muhammad's Peace be upon him versus prior to Muhammad's Peace be upon him in terms of the sanctity of that place. So we honor it. And Masjid Al-Aksa in particular is the place where the Prophet Muhammad Peace be upon him leads the other prophets in prayer in the night of what's known as at Islam and Mourage, the night journey of the Prophet Peace be upon him, and then he ascends to the heavens and back. And it's also the first Kibla, which is the first place of direction of prayer for us. So before Muslims faced Mecca and prayer for the first half of Islam, they actually faced towards Jerusalem in their prayer. It was our direction of prayer and it remained a fundamental part of our faith, our fundamental holy sanctuary. There are three sanctuaries in Islam, Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem. And Masjid Al-Aksa is precious to us. And so you can imagine then the pain of watching innocent Palestinian worshippers being stomped on by Israeli soldiers or skunk water being sprayed on people as they're trying to walk in or tear gasping, taking place in the nights of Ramadan in that place. The restrictions on people that live right next to it and that cannot pray in it due to the certain classification of Palestinian that they've been given or the age, right? Because generally speaking, if you're younger, you're not allowed to go to Mecca, even if you live within the occupied territories. So it's tough to watch such a sacred place with such an ugly occupation. But I'll also say this, that the sanctity of a human being, the sanctity of just one person is greater than the sanctity of any place of worship to us. So the sanctity of one individual in Gaza or one individual in Jerusalem is greater to us than the sanctity of a place of worship. But it was all certainly interconnected. That's a really powerful idea. The value of a human being is greater than even the al-Aksa Mosque. That's a foundational idea for Islam. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, says to the Qabba itself, that the value of a believer's dignity and honor is greater than the value of the structure itself. And so when I see a person in Gaza, a guest upon, when I see one wala dhahdua, when I see one child, that's greater to me than even al-Aksa. But al-Aksa is at the heart of who we are as well. And it's certainly at the heart of the Palestinian cause. It's a place of prophets and it's a place that should be treated prophetically.",subjective

Israel's digging underneath the mosque, and they're claiming it's for archaeological excavations. Excavations are destroying the structural integrity of the mosque, and every single time Muslims request build permits to stabilize it, Israel denies it. Structural integrity has become so weak that a stone actually fell from the mosque, and Israeli authorities just moved it away. In the past six months, especially, the structural integrity is very seriously damaged now. Historical was written last year and look how much digging they've done underneath. I don't know if the media is not reporting on it because they don't want Muslims to know, but it's getting really bad, and they're blocking every restoration permit.

Every other belief system recognizes Jesus and the teaching and the history surrounding him. But in Israel, they just see him as another dude, in which it's dangerous because within Islam and Christianity, they have an Antichrist or the Dejal.

I would love it if you can describe why it is such an important place, a holy place for Muslims in general, but also for this particular crisis that we have been speaking about today. So Muslims honor the history of all of the prophets. So all of the prophets that have walked in that place, all of the prophets that have worshiped in that place, all of that makes it sacred. So it's not separated from Muslims from post-Muhammad's Peace be upon him versus prior to Muhammad's Peace be upon him in terms of the sanctity of that place. So we honor it. And Masjid Al-Aksa in particular is the place where the Prophet Muhammad Peace be upon him leads the other prophets in prayer in the night of what's known as at Islam and Mourage, the night journey of the Prophet Peace be upon him, and then he ascends to the heavens and back. And it's also the first Kibla, which is the first place of direction of prayer for us. So before Muslims faced Mecca and prayer for the first half of Islam, they actually faced towards Jerusalem in their prayer. It was our direction of prayer and it remained a fundamental part of our faith, our fundamental holy sanctuary. There are three sanctuaries in Islam, Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem. And Masjid Al-Aksa is precious to us. And so you can imagine then the pain of watching innocent Palestinian worshippers being stomped on by Israeli soldiers or skunk water being sprayed on people as they're trying to walk in or tear gasping, taking place in the nights of Ramadan in that place. The restrictions on people that live right next to it and that cannot pray in it due to the certain classification of Palestinian that they've been given or the age, right? Because generally speaking, if you're younger, you're not allowed to go to Mecca, even if you live within the occupied territories. So it's tough to watch such a sacred place with such an ugly occupation. But I'll also say this, that the sanctity of a human being, the sanctity of just one person is greater than the sanctity of any place of worship to us. So the sanctity of one individual in Gaza or one individual in Jerusalem is greater to us than the sanctity of a place of worship. But it was all certainly interconnected. That's a really powerful idea. The value of a human being is greater than even the al-Aksa Mosque. That's a foundational idea for Islam. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, says to the Qabba itself, that the value of a believer's dignity and honor is greater than the value of the structure itself. And so when I see a person in Gaza, a guest upon, when I see one wala dhahdua, when I see one child, that's greater to me than even al-Aksa. But al-Aksa is at the heart of who we are as well.

For reference, this is not actually all oxomosk, it's this one right over here, but some people get it confused. Instead of destroying it all at once for the world to see, Israel's been taking a very insidious approach and destroying it from the bottom up. Israel's digging underneath the mosque, and they're claiming it's for archaeological excavations. Excavations are destroying the structural integrity of the mosque, and every single time Muslims request build permits to stabilize it, Israel denies it. Structural integrity has become so weak that a stone actually fell from the mosque, and Israeli authorities just moved it away.

Every other belief system recognizes Jesus and the teaching and the history surrounding him. But in Israel, they just see him as another dude, in which it's dangerous because within Islam and Christianity, they have an Antichrist or the Dejal.

I would love it if you can describe why it is such an important place, a holy place for Muslims in general, but also for this particular crisis that we have been speaking about today. So Muslims honor the history of all of the prophets. So all of the prophets that have walked in that place, all of the prophets that have worshiped in that place, all of that makes it sacred. So it's not separated from Muslims from post-Muhammad's Peace be upon him versus prior to Muhammad's Peace be upon him in terms of the sanctity of that place. So we honor it. And Masjid Al-Aksa in particular is the place where the Prophet Muhammad Peace be upon him leads the other prophets in prayer in the night of what's known as at Islam and Mourage, the night journey of the Prophet Peace be upon him, and then he ascends to the heavens and back. And it's also the first Kibla, which is the first place of direction of prayer for us. So before Muslims faced Mecca and prayer for the first half of Islam, they actually faced towards Jerusalem in their prayer. It was our direction of prayer and it remained a fundamental part of our faith, our fundamental holy sanctuary. There are three sanctuaries in Islam, Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem. And Masjid Al-Aksa is precious to us. And so you can imagine then the pain of watching innocent Palestinian worshippers being stomped on by Israeli soldiers or skunk water being sprayed on people as they're trying to walk in or tear gasping, taking place in the nights of Ramadan in that place. The restrictions on people that live right next to it and that cannot pray in it due to the certain classification of Palestinian that they've been given or the age, right? Because generally speaking, if you're younger, you're not allowed to go to Mecca, even if you live within the occupied territories. So it's tough to watch such a sacred place with such an ugly occupation. But I'll also say this, that the sanctity of a human being, the sanctity of just one person is greater than the sanctity of any place of worship to us. So the sanctity of one individual in Gaza or one individual in Jerusalem is greater to us than the sanctity of a place of worship. But it was all certainly interconnected. That's a really powerful idea. The value of a human being is greater than even the al-Aksa Mosque. That's a foundational idea for Islam. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, says to the Qabba itself, that the value of a believer's dignity and honor is greater than the value of the structure itself. And so when I see a person in Gaza, a guest upon, when I see one wala dhahdua, when I see one child, that's greater to me than even al-Aksa. But al-Aksa is at the heart of who we are as well. And it's certainly at the heart of the Palestinian cause. It's a place of prophets and it's a place that should be treated prophetically.",subjective

To put that in perspective, that means that it was worse than some of the things that Israel will say were the IDF. Shiron was born a royal shinerman. It didn't change his name until Ben-Gurion suggested the more Hebrew sounding Shiron. There's a lot of great reasons change your name, but this isn't one. My family changed their name to avoid anti-Semitism. Shiron changed his so criticism sounded like anti-Semitism. Later, when Shiron was defense minister, an Israeli commission ruled that the Sabra and Shatila massacre, which killed hundreds to thousands of civilians in Beirut was Shiron's personal responsibility. That doesn't sound right to me. I don't think Shiron ever took responsibility for anything. Shiron refused to resign after the commission's findings and was eventually allowed to stay in the Israeli cabinet as a minister without portfolio. For those of you unfamiliar with parliamentary governments, a minister without portfolio is pretty much the same, but they're only in charge of symbolic evil. Shiron was a complicated figure, and I do wanna make it clear that there's certain things he did that I approve of. For instance, I'm a big fan of the eight years when he didn't harm any civilians because he was in a vegetative state. All right, let me know who else I should roast. And join me next time for part two of my roast of Israeli prime minister, General, and a guy who looks like he just heard that this sheep is living in a home that a settler wants, Arale Shiron.",subjective

They sealed off the camps. They threw flares into the night sky to slowly drift down and illuminate the camps. They sent the philangist in. They said, clear out the terrorists for us. The philangist had a score to settle. So they spent about two days in there slaughtering people. The IDF did periodic check-in saying, well, good job, good job. Two days later they said, good job, and they pulled out. Tell me if there's anything I left out because it's been a while since I've read about this. I think Rafael Aitan was the headhuncho.

They sealed off the camps. They threw flares into the night sky to slowly drift down and illuminate the camps. They sent the philangist in. They said, clear out the terrorists for us. The philangist had a score to settle. So they spent about two days in there slaughtering people. The IDF did periodic check-in saying, well, good job, good job.

Today I'll be roasting Israeli Prime Minister, General, and Crumpled Polar Bear, Arale Shiro. When he was in the Israeli defense force, Shiron let a raid which took the lives of at least 60 Palestinians civilians by dynamiting their homes after forgetting to check whether the homes were occupied. You know, people forget to check stuff all the time. For instance, before giving him power, somebody forgot to check whether Shiron was a decent human being. Shiron's raid, now known as the Kibbya Massacre, produced such a strong international backlash that Israel's Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, officially claimed that the soldiers involved were vigilantes and not the IDF. To put that in perspective, that means that it was worse than some of the things that Israel will say were the IDF. Shiron was born a royal shinerman. It didn't change his name until Ben-Gurion suggested the more Hebrew sounding Shiron. There's a lot of great reasons change your name, but this isn't one. My family changed their name to avoid anti-Semitism. Shiron changed his so criticism sounded like anti-Semitism. Later, when Shiron was defense minister, an Israeli commission ruled that the Sabra and Shatila massacre, which killed hundreds to thousands of civilians in Beirut was Shiron's personal responsibility. That doesn't sound right to me. I don't think Shiron ever took responsibility for anything. Shiron refused to resign after the commission's findings and was eventually allowed to stay in the Israeli cabinet as a minister without portfolio. For those of you unfamiliar with parliamentary governments, a minister without portfolio is pretty much the same, but they're only in charge of symbolic evil. Shiron was a complicated figure, and I do wanna make it clear that there's certain things he did that I approve of. For instance, I'm a big fan of the eight years when he didn't harm any civilians because he was in a vegetative state. All right, let me know who else I should roast. And join me next time for part two of my roast of Israeli prime minister, General, and a guy who looks like he just heard that this sheep is living in a home that a settler wants, Arale Shiron.",subjective

Today is part two of my roast of Israeli Prime Minister, general, and the guy who looks like the patriarch in a midi-set Tennessee Williams play, Ariel Shorou. During the 1956 Sinai campaign, troops under Shorouan's command summarily executed 49 Egyptians, civilians that they had taken prisoner because, as one soldier put it, they were a burden. That's so stupid and evil. You know what's objectively less of a burden than keeping prisoners, not taking the prisoner in the first place? Although Shorouan was in charge of that unit, it's never been proven that he ordered those executions, although it's definitely true that he didn't punish the soldiers who carried them out. Makes me think of that quote, the only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing. It turns out, it works if bad men do nothing too. Out of the 1977 elections, Shorouan pitched himself as a party leader to right, center, and left-wing parties, but was rejected by all three, forcing him to found his own. I've heard that Shorouan united Israel. I didn't realize that he united Israel against him. As Defense Minister in the 80s, Shorouan maintained Israel's close relationship with apartheid era South Africa, selling them weapons and cooperating militarily despite a UN arms embargo against them. Syniks will say that Shorouan compromises principles for the beneficial alliance, but I say what principles? Shorouan is remembered for ending Israeli settlements in Gaza in 2005, despite settlements and palestinian territories actually growing over his time as Prime Minister. That seems unfair. That'd be like if I was remembered for all the tasteless jokes I didn't make instead of the very rude one I made at the end of the last video on Shorouan. According to a close Shorouan aide, his disengagement from Gaza was designed to cut off Gaza and freeze the political peace process. They say when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail, but when all you have is Shorouan's brain, everything looks like a way to continue an occupation. All right, let me know who else I should roast and join me next time when I'll be roasting Mayor of Chicago and a guy who looks like he was born to be in his Corsese movie for five minutes, Richard J.

Okay, so things is getting a little topsy. Turn me over there in the east coast. I'm sorry, the middle east, okay? And where we left off at was Israel has called for up to 77,000 reserved soldiers to back to active duty. Basically the same thing that we see in right here in America where you literally could have been out of the service for 12, 13 years. And they brought you out of retirement. You don't get a choice. Listen, once a soldier always a soldier. Now news came down the pipeline that they were actually beefing up soldiers. I can't listen. This is just down the aisle of branch that they were beefing up soldiers and reserved soldiers. Not because they were trying to defend themselves but because they were planning an attack on the last day of Ramadan. So a couple of ISIS agents were captured and after they were no matter who captured them, just trust me on this. After they were captured, they were questioned. And basically they came forward and stated, yeah, our assignment was for a situation to jump off on the last day of Ramadan. In the middle east we did not get an actual location but my best guess would be somewhere in Syria, Damascus, or the Huzn Street. That's just where I would guess. I've seen them shooting missiles and dropping bombs and burrowing at the southern blebodies border and several other places. So I wouldn't be surprised if it was just some random spot. Now since finding out this information, Big Boop with the loot, he deployed additional forces into the Syrian whole Golden Heights near the Israeli border. Okay, so as I stated before, they beefing up right now. Everybody beefing up their security. Like I said, we cannot stop these very big ramen with all this power and all this money from doing what they want to do. As you can see, we condemn it because we don't want them killing people in order to save people. You should never kill nobody in order to save some people. However, the people that's actually killing the people that they try to save is killing more people to stop them from trying to save the people that they try to kill. Oh, Lord Jesus. My hair hurt, but stay with me. Now as this is going on, KKK basically released a statement asking yet again for all Islamic countries to unite against Israel. And after we got key details of which exact air defense systems that were beefed up, as you can see above, I will not be reading it, but just know that it's... It's gonna go, boom. After seeing the key details of what they actually, you know, what Iran beefed up their air defense systems with, Rishik flipped again. The Prime Minister of UK, I know it's hard to remember who these people are. But Britain called for an in-media cease yet again fire. And then into the world, Haza, it is not a war. It is a ethnic cleansing. And suddenly with Iran about to retaliate the West is starting to get nervous. So basically everybody, you know, picking up their phone, they making them calls, they're not doing this. Do your biggest, but leave us out of it basically. But we've seen these exact countries financing this exact genocide. And the weaponry that was used in the attack in Damascus was financing funded by these countries. What do you mean? Again, Iran was reiterating, like, listen, I don't have to repeat myself, but for you, baby, I sure will. We will give Israel a response they have never seen before, since the defense minister of Iran. And if that wasn't bad enough, good got them mighty. Yemen decided to send, or basically, like, if Iran knows, if you need somehow, we got you on 400,000 soldiers. We've added for whatever. And Iran again, let it be known. Listen, he said at this point, we can't reason with BB. We cannot reason with that man and his military cabinet. So I'm a do my biggest and I'm a do my best to convince the soldiers on the ground. You better take your ass home. Because if I get there and you're still there, you're going to wish you left when you had the opportunity to. This man said, use your brain and go back home to your homes in America and Europe. Wait a minute. Hold up. We didn't ask for them to come here. They can go somewhere else. Okay, I live in America. They can go somewhere. We got enough. We don't need no more. We just got 20k shit, man. We'll catch the next shit, man. Send them to Europe. Send them to Europe. We, we, listen. Okay, I'm sorry, Europe. I'm not trying to throw you under the bus, but what I am saying is, can you hold on to them for a little bit? We tied. We tied. We tied in this country. We is tied. And as of this morning, news broke out that the IDF has fully withdrawn from Hain units and the rest of southern Gaza. And as I continue to update you, the tele is jumping and it's telling that they are withdrawing all soldiers are withdrawing from so many parts of Gaza. So if you're not seeing a lot of stuff today about there being a massacre, you may still see some stuff. Okay, you may still see some stuff because they're, they're very persistent. It's what I want to say. They're persistent and they're need to ethnically cleanse this area. You may still see some stuff, but if you're not seeing as much as you normally do, this is why that man KK literally got up and they got the moving. Do you want to say what I'm saying? They're not telling you. He said jump and they said, how high would you like us to go? Let me know because you know, I'm going to head back up out of this situation. No Israeli forces remain in Gaza except in Gaza City in the outskirts. And I did just see this morning that there was some conflict between big H and the Israeli settlers and the the Iowa soldiers this morning in Gaza City. It looks like the majority of the information that we are receiving this Sunday morning was coming directly out of Gaza City. Again, if you're not understanding why anything you're not hearing anything from Ramallah from, you know, in the West Bank and from, you know, several different parts of the Housen strip is because of, you know, they're, they're retreating. They're running. Or they're just trying to come up with a different strategy, but either way they fully retreat. And for some reason, this male still woke up and decided, I'm going to go ahead and get up on my zoom Israel is one step away from the three in Gaza. Says, way, I'm sorry. I said two days off. Did I miss something? Did you get your hostages back? I just back because I didn't hear nothing on the, the come down all the branch about, about, about the hostages being returned. The last I saw even last night, the people in Tel Aviv were still turning up. And it was still people trying to escape Tel Aviv. What do you mean you're one step away from victory? This sounds like a bold face to lie. I'm just going ahead and throw my opinion out there. But in my opinion, this sounds like a bold face to lie because you have not achieved any of your objectives. You haven't found Hamas. You haven't found any of the hostages. They had to be returned to you in exchange for other hostages. And then you went back and broke your own hostages deal. I don't sound like a man who's on the verge of a victory to me. Because the last we heard, it unspecifically told America, step aside. And I'm not going to lose my king because if you don't, you will receive a blow. And from what news is saying is Jody Joe stepped aside, honey. They stepped aside. In addition to that, they told Jody Joe straight to his face. These are the last days of Israel. Again, I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy, but Lord, what do you mean you're on your way to achieving victory, Betty? You don't even see the danger that's surrounding you. And as of right now, the IDF Homefront Command has issued a list of emergency instructions for the remaining people in Tel Aviv and Israel all over Israel to ensure a water and food supply for at least three days. Take photo copies, divide or documents, and have cash on hand. Your vehicles' fuel tanks should be at least half full of gas and to take a battery powered radio and flashlight. That don't sound like somebody who's on their way to victory, baby. You're not being honest with us again. What's really going on, boy? What's really going on, baby? Things is getting real in the food. Again, we will wish this on our worst enemy. I think you all should be more focused, less on bombing Lebanon and messing and picking with the Palestinians and Central Gaza or Gaza City, but more focused on getting your people to safety. I think that would lessen some tensions and lessen some of the lasting and resounding effects and energy that has caused the people to believe that you want this to be a full-out world war. Because right now, all we can see is that. I don't know, y'all. Let me know what y'all think in the comments below. Now that we got in caught up on everything, we're just waiting to hear back from the Allah-Branch-the-Payt-Blinder, Sully. You know what it is? About what's going on over there in Palestine, okay? Because we need to know. Quiet minds need to know. Are they okay? Are they safe?",subjective

Okay, so things is getting a little topsy. Turn me over there in the east coast. I'm sorry, the middle east, okay? And where we left off at was Israel has called for up to 77,000 reserved soldiers to back to active duty. Basically the same thing that we see in right here in America where you literally could have been out of the service for 12, 13 years. And they brought you out of retirement. You don't get a choice. Listen, once a soldier always a soldier. Now news came down the pipeline that they were actually beefing up soldiers. I can't listen. This is just down the aisle of branch that they were beefing up soldiers and reserved soldiers. Not because they were trying to defend themselves but because they were planning an attack on the last day of Ramadan. So a couple of ISIS agents were captured and after they were no matter who captured them, just trust me on this. After they were captured, they were questioned. And basically they came forward and stated, yeah, our assignment was for a situation to jump off on the last day of Ramadan. In the middle east we did not get an actual location but my best guess would be somewhere in Syria, Damascus, or the Huzn Street. That's just where I would guess. I've seen them shooting missiles and dropping bombs and burrowing at the southern blebodies border and several other places. So I wouldn't be surprised if it was just some random spot. Now since finding out this information, Big Boop with the loot, he deployed additional forces into the Syrian whole Golden Heights near the Israeli border. Okay, so as I stated before, they beefing up right now. Everybody beefing up their security. Like I said, we cannot stop these very big ramen with all this power and all this money from doing what they want to do. As you can see, we condemn it because we don't want them killing people in order to save people. You should never kill nobody in order to save some people. However, the people that's actually killing the people that they try to save is killing more people to stop them from trying to save the people that they try to kill. Oh, Lord Jesus. My hair hurt, but stay with me. Now as this is going on, KKK basically released a statement asking yet again for all Islamic countries to unite against Israel. And after we got key details of which exact air defense systems that were beefed up, as you can see above, I will not be reading it, but just know that it's... It's gonna go, boom. After seeing the key details of what they actually, you know, what Iran beefed up their air defense systems with, Rishik flipped again. The Prime Minister of UK, I know it's hard to remember who these people are. But Britain called for an in-media cease yet again fire. And then into the world, Haza, it is not a war. It is a ethnic cleansing. And suddenly with Iran about to retaliate the West is starting to get nervous. So basically everybody, you know, picking up their phone, they making them calls, they're not doing this. Do your biggest, but leave us out of it basically. But we've seen these exact countries financing this exact genocide. And the weaponry that was used in the attack in Damascus was financing funded by these countries. What do you mean? Again, Iran was reiterating, like, listen, I don't have to repeat myself, but for you, baby, I sure will. We will give Israel a response they have never seen before, since the defense minister of Iran. And if that wasn't bad enough, good got them mighty. Yemen decided to send, or basically, like, if Iran knows, if you need somehow, we got you on 400,000 soldiers. We've added for whatever. And Iran again, let it be known. Listen, he said at this point, we can't reason with BB. We cannot reason with that man and his military cabinet. So I'm a do my biggest and I'm a do my best to convince the soldiers on the ground. You better take your ass home. Because if I get there and you're still there, you're going to wish you left when you had the opportunity to. This man said, use your brain and go back home to your homes in America and Europe. Wait a minute. Hold up. We didn't ask for them to come here. They can go somewhere else. Okay, I live in America. They can go somewhere. We got enough. We don't need no more. We just got 20k shit, man. We'll catch the next shit, man. Send them to Europe. Send them to Europe. We, we, listen. Okay, I'm sorry, Europe. I'm not trying to throw you under the bus, but what I am saying is, can you hold on to them for a little bit? We tied. We tied. We tied in this country. We is tied. And as of this morning, news broke out that the IDF has fully withdrawn from Hain units and the rest of southern Gaza. And as I continue to update you, the tele is jumping and it's telling that they are withdrawing all soldiers are withdrawing from so many parts of Gaza. So if you're not seeing a lot of stuff today about there being a massacre, you may still see some stuff. Okay, you may still see some stuff because they're, they're very persistent. It's what I want to say. They're persistent and they're need to ethnically cleanse this area. You may still see some stuff, but if you're not seeing as much as you normally do, this is why that man KK literally got up and they got the moving. Do you want to say what I'm saying? They're not telling you. He said jump and they said, how high would you like us to go? Let me know because you know, I'm going to head back up out of this situation. No Israeli forces remain in Gaza except in Gaza City in the outskirts. And I did just see this morning that there was some conflict between big H and the Israeli settlers and the the Iowa soldiers this morning in Gaza City. It looks like the majority of the information that we are receiving this Sunday morning was coming directly out of Gaza City. Again, if you're not understanding why anything you're not hearing anything from Ramallah from, you know, in the West Bank and from, you know, several different parts of the Housen strip is because of, you know, they're, they're retreating. They're running. Or they're just trying to come up with a different strategy, but either way they fully retreat. And for some reason, this male still woke up and decided, I'm going to go ahead and get up on my zoom Israel is one step away from the three in Gaza. Says, way, I'm sorry. I said two days off. Did I miss something? Did you get your hostages back? I just back because I didn't hear nothing on the, the come down all the branch about, about, about the hostages being returned. The last I saw even last night, the people in Tel Aviv were still turning up. And it was still people trying to escape Tel Aviv. What do you mean you're one step away from victory? This sounds like a bold face to lie. I'm just going ahead and throw my opinion out there. But in my opinion, this sounds like a bold face to lie because you have not achieved any of your objectives. You haven't found Hamas. You haven't found any of the hostages. They had to be returned to you in exchange for other hostages. And then you went back and broke your own hostages deal. I don't sound like a man who's on the verge of a victory to me. Because the last we heard, it unspecifically told America, step aside. And I'm not going to lose my king because if you don't, you will receive a blow. And from what news is saying is Jody Joe stepped aside, honey. They stepped aside. In addition to that, they told Jody Joe straight to his face. These are the last days of Israel. Again, I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy, but Lord, what do you mean you're on your way to achieving victory, Betty? You don't even see the danger that's surrounding you. And as of right now, the IDF Homefront Command has issued a list of emergency instructions for the remaining people in Tel Aviv and Israel all over Israel to ensure a water and food supply for at least three days. Take photo copies, divide or documents, and have cash on hand. Your vehicles' fuel tanks should be at least half full of gas and to take a battery powered radio and flashlight. That don't sound like somebody who's on their way to victory, baby. You're not being honest with us again. What's really going on, boy? What's really going on, baby? Things is getting real in the food. Again, we will wish this on our worst enemy. I think you all should be more focused, less on bombing Lebanon and messing and picking with the Palestinians and Central Gaza or Gaza City, but more focused on getting your people to safety. I think that would lessen some tensions and lessen some of the lasting and resounding effects and energy that has caused the people to believe that you want this to be a full-out world war. Because right now, all we can see is that. I don't know, y'all. Let me know what y'all think in the comments below. Now that we got in caught up on everything, we're just waiting to hear back from the Allah-Branch-the-Payt-Blinder, Sully. You know what it is? About what's going on over there in Palestine, okay? Because we need to know. Quiet minds need to know. Are they okay? Are they safe?",subjective

I'm personally infuriated by this to this date. When was that? 2017, 2019, 2019? I, to this day, I have nightmares about it. I'm so personally offended.

Okay, so things is getting a little topsy. Turn me over there in the east coast. I'm sorry, the middle east, okay? And where we left off at was Israel has called for up to 77,000 reserved soldiers to back to active duty. Basically the same thing that we see in right here in America where you literally could have been out of the service for 12, 13 years. And they brought you out of retirement. You don't get a choice. Listen, once a soldier always a soldier. Now news came down the pipeline that they were actually beefing up soldiers. I can't listen. This is just down the aisle of branch that they were beefing up soldiers and reserved soldiers. Not because they were trying to defend themselves but because they were planning an attack on the last day of Ramadan. So a couple of ISIS agents were captured and after they were no matter who captured them, just trust me on this. After they were captured, they were questioned. And basically they came forward and stated, yeah, our assignment was for a situation to jump off on the last day of Ramadan. In the middle east we did not get an actual location but my best guess would be somewhere in Syria, Damascus, or the Huzn Street. That's just where I would guess. I've seen them shooting missiles and dropping bombs and burrowing at the southern blebodies border and several other places. So I wouldn't be surprised if it was just some random spot. Now since finding out this information, Big Boop with the loot, he deployed additional forces into the Syrian whole Golden Heights near the Israeli border. Okay, so as I stated before, they beefing up right now. Everybody beefing up their security. Like I said, we cannot stop these very big ramen with all this power and all this money from doing what they want to do. As you can see, we condemn it because we don't want them killing people in order to save people. You should never kill nobody in order to save some people. However, the people that's actually killing the people that they try to save is killing more people to stop them from trying to save the people that they try to kill. Oh, Lord Jesus. My hair hurt, but stay with me. Now as this is going on, KKK basically released a statement asking yet again for all Islamic countries to unite against Israel. And after we got key details of which exact air defense systems that were beefed up, as you can see above, I will not be reading it, but just know that it's... It's gonna go, boom. After seeing the key details of what they actually, you know, what Iran beefed up their air defense systems with, Rishik flipped again. The Prime Minister of UK, I know it's hard to remember who these people are. But Britain called for an in-media cease yet again fire. And then into the world, Haza, it is not a war. It is a ethnic cleansing. And suddenly with Iran about to retaliate the West is starting to get nervous. So basically everybody, you know, picking up their phone, they making them calls, they're not doing this. Do your biggest, but leave us out of it basically. But we've seen these exact countries financing this exact genocide. And the weaponry that was used in the attack in Damascus was financing funded by these countries. What do you mean? Again, Iran was reiterating, like, listen, I don't have to repeat myself, but for you, baby, I sure will. We will give Israel a response they have never seen before, since the defense minister of Iran. And if that wasn't bad enough, good got them mighty. Yemen decided to send, or basically, like, if Iran knows, if you need somehow, we got you on 400,000 soldiers. We've added for whatever. And Iran again, let it be known. Listen, he said at this point, we can't reason with BB. We cannot reason with that man and his military cabinet. So I'm a do my biggest and I'm a do my best to convince the soldiers on the ground. You better take your ass home. Because if I get there and you're still there, you're going to wish you left when you had the opportunity to. This man said, use your brain and go back home to your homes in America and Europe. Wait a minute. Hold up. We didn't ask for them to come here. They can go somewhere else. Okay, I live in America. They can go somewhere. We got enough. We don't need no more. We just got 20k shit, man. We'll catch the next shit, man. Send them to Europe. Send them to Europe. We, we, listen. Okay, I'm sorry, Europe. I'm not trying to throw you under the bus, but what I am saying is, can you hold on to them for a little bit? We tied. We tied. We tied in this country. We is tied. And as of this morning, news broke out that the IDF has fully withdrawn from Hain units and the rest of southern Gaza. And as I continue to update you, the tele is jumping and it's telling that they are withdrawing all soldiers are withdrawing from so many parts of Gaza. So if you're not seeing a lot of stuff today about there being a massacre, you may still see some stuff. Okay, you may still see some stuff because they're, they're very persistent. It's what I want to say. They're persistent and they're need to ethnically cleanse this area. You may still see some stuff, but if you're not seeing as much as you normally do, this is why that man KK literally got up and they got the moving. Do you want to say what I'm saying? They're not telling you. He said jump and they said, how high would you like us to go? Let me know because you know, I'm going to head back up out of this situation. No Israeli forces remain in Gaza except in Gaza City in the outskirts. And I did just see this morning that there was some conflict between big H and the Israeli settlers and the the Iowa soldiers this morning in Gaza City. It looks like the majority of the information that we are receiving this Sunday morning was coming directly out of Gaza City. Again, if you're not understanding why anything you're not hearing anything from Ramallah from, you know, in the West Bank and from, you know, several different parts of the Housen strip is because of, you know, they're, they're retreating. They're running. Or they're just trying to come up with a different strategy, but either way they fully retreat. And for some reason, this male still woke up and decided, I'm going to go ahead and get up on my zoom Israel is one step away from the three in Gaza. Says, way, I'm sorry. I said two days off. Did I miss something? Did you get your hostages back? I just back because I didn't hear nothing on the, the come down all the branch about, about, about the hostages being returned. The last I saw even last night, the people in Tel Aviv were still turning up. And it was still people trying to escape Tel Aviv. What do you mean you're one step away from victory? This sounds like a bold face to lie. I'm just going ahead and throw my opinion out there. But in my opinion, this sounds like a bold face to lie because you have not achieved any of your objectives. You haven't found Hamas. You haven't found any of the hostages. They had to be returned to you in exchange for other hostages. And then you went back and broke your own hostages deal. I don't sound like a man who's on the verge of a victory to me. Because the last we heard, it unspecifically told America, step aside. And I'm not going to lose my king because if you don't, you will receive a blow. And from what news is saying is Jody Joe stepped aside, honey. They stepped aside. In addition to that, they told Jody Joe straight to his face. These are the last days of Israel. Again, I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy, but Lord, what do you mean you're on your way to achieving victory, Betty? You don't even see the danger that's surrounding you. And as of right now, the IDF Homefront Command has issued a list of emergency instructions for the remaining people in Tel Aviv and Israel all over Israel to ensure a water and food supply for at least three days. Take photo copies, divide or documents, and have cash on hand. Your vehicles' fuel tanks should be at least half full of gas and to take a battery powered radio and flashlight. That don't sound like somebody who's on their way to victory, baby. You're not being honest with us again. What's really going on, boy? What's really going on, baby? Things is getting real in the food. Again, we will wish this on our worst enemy. I think you all should be more focused, less on bombing Lebanon and messing and picking with the Palestinians and Central Gaza or Gaza City, but more focused on getting your people to safety. I think that would lessen some tensions and lessen some of the lasting and resounding effects and energy that has caused the people to believe that you want this to be a full-out world war. Because right now, all we can see is that. I don't know, y'all. Let me know what y'all think in the comments below. Now that we got in caught up on everything, we're just waiting to hear back from the Allah-Branch-the-Payt-Blinder, Sully. You know what it is? About what's going on over there in Palestine, okay? Because we need to know. Quiet minds need to know. Are they okay? Are they safe?",subjective

An accession of territory by force is prohibited under international law.

And I feel like probably the worst of them all. How many people know about you, the US that uses anti-boycott laws for Israel or anti-BDS laws? And how many people know what that is? Many United States states are using anti-boycott laws and executive orders to punish companies that refuse to do business with illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank human rights watch set today. This is an article from 2019. So some of this information is going to be wrong, but I will show you the current list of states that have these laws more than 250 million Americans, some 78% of the population live in states with anti-boycott laws are policy 27 states 35 states now have adopted laws or policies that penalize businesses, organizations or individuals that engage in or call for boycotts against Israel. The laws or policies in the in 17 of those states that might be different now. I'm not sure about that number, explicitly target not only companies that refuse to do business in or with Israel, but also those that refuse to do business in Israeli settlements. Some state who law whose laws do not explicitly apply to settlement have also penalized companies that cut settlement tie states with anti-boycott laws are effectively telling companies that if you do the right thing and distangle yourself from settlement. And abuse abuses you can't do business with us says Andrea Parcell deputy US advocacy director at human rights watch. States should encourage not sanctioned companies that avoid contributing to rights abuses. Many states have anti boycott laws or policies that extend to individuals and companies that enter into business contracts with states. These laws and policies require people entering into contracts to assert that they will not engage in any boycott activities. Businesses literally have to put this into their into their law into their policies. In January 2019, the US Senate passed a bill that endorsed state anti-boycott legislation, including those that encompass settlement business activity. In March federal lawmakers introduced resolutions in both the Senate and the House to condemn boycotts of Israel. None of these initiatives has has yet to become US law. Anti boycott laws aim to deter companies from cutting ties to settlements and thereby ending their involvement in human rights abuses there. States should scrap anti boycott laws that penalized companies for taking actions that enter involvement in rights abuses. This chart taken from Wikipedia shows all of the states that currently have anti-BDS laws put into place. Do you know how crazy this is? I literally just learned about this fucking yesterday and I was like, what the fuck are we talking about? What do you mean you can't choose to not do business with Israel? Whoa, wow, wow, what the fuck you mean? And with all of this, let's also take a look at something else that I learned yesterday, which again, just fucking madness, known as the Goldstone Report. After the Gaza War, which took place from December 27th to January 18th of 2009, a UN fact-finding mission headed by Judge Richard Goldstone, was established in 2009. Mary Robertson, the former president of Ireland, had declined an invitation by the UN Human Rights Council to head the committee, saying the mandate was not guided by human rights and international human rights laws, but by politics. Which I think is very interesting when the intentions for this were to essentially figure out whether or not human rights violations were being committed in Israel by the Israeli government as well as Hamas. Israel refused to engage with the mission and denied any understanding of Israel's motives in attacking the Gaza Strip. Israel also barred Goldstone in his colleagues from entering Gaza from Israel, forcing them to travel via Egypt. The embargo on Goldstone was endorsed by Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, and he'd hood-barak, the Defense Minister. But many politicians and commentaries disagreed with the government's refusal to engage with the mission. That is incredibly important. This is also incredibly important to note that prior to what we are now seeing happening in Gaza, there were a lot of Israeli people who felt incredibly negative about Benjamin Netanyahu. So much to the point that there were scheduled protests against him prior to all of this taking place. And when I mean at the same time, I mean what is currently taking place. A lot of this information is coming from 2009 when things like this were, when they had tried to establish this. At the same time, the Israeli army embarked on an unprecedented investigation into its own war crimes, including the puping a civilian to carrying white flags, the shelling of United Nations schools, which was being used as a refuge, and the unallibing of 29 members of Al Samooni family. The report called for both parties Hamas and Israel to investigate their own actions and accuse both of deliberately targeting civilians. Goldstone was vilified by pro-Israel groups as a self-hating Jew. And his report was likened to the blood to a blood liable, a false charge against Jews with roots in medieval anti-Semitism. Nevertheless, the report galvanized Israel to start investigations into the charges that were made against its military operation, which are still ongoing. Which I think is absolutely fucking mad to ask the groups that you are claiming are enacting human rights violations to investigate themselves. That's fucking not. What he wrote in his initial statement that Israel was targeting civilians, he later retracted. He wrote that the report's initial findings that Israel intentionally targeted civilians was wrong. And he praised Israel for investigating allegations against it while criticizing Hamas for failing to do the same. Goldstone's apparent and quotations, retraction, was met with jubilation in Israel. Goldstone later informed the media that he did not speak directly with Yish Hay who does not speak English and insisted he stood by the report. There is so much mystery shrouding this report. It seems like this man was backed into a corner in blackmail to unsave the things that he had written about. I just want people to be aware that there is so much at play when it comes to this conversation. The level of intimidation that is used to stop even businesses from being able to talk about it with the anti-BDS laws or when a person tries to come through and talk about human rights violations occurring, they later retract all of a sudden. This man wasn't even allowed to go to his own grandson's bar mitzvah in South Africa because of what he had stated. We need to be incredibly critical of everything we are seeing. It is very obvious that there are laws in place that do not allow you to disparage the Israeli government. It is incredibly apparent. So continue to talk about these things guys and continue to stay safe.",subjective

This is gonna be a long video, so if you want to speed up the video, if I start rambling, or if you have the attention spawn of a toddler, but I will start by talking about what was at the end of the report, like the suggestions from the mission. If you don't know what I'm talking about, please watch this video that I made a few days ago about the Goldstone Report. I will be quoting a lot of this document because unlike the Israeli government, we like to come up with receipts and everything that I'm talking about in this video will be in the shmink in my profile. The Goldstone Report is available in multiple languages. It's available in Arabic, English, French, Spanish, Russian and Chinese as well. So if you want to download all of that, again, it's in the shmink in my profile, but without further ado, let's go. So at the end of the report, the mission gives recommendation to the United Nation as well as the Human Rights Council. I'm just gonna read a few sections and then we will go to the resolution. So there was a meeting that was held after this. And yeah, that's what we're mainly gonna talk about today. But so in the Goldstone Report section 1969 to the United Nations Security Council, a, the mission recommends that the Security Council should require the government of Israel under Article 40 of the character of the United Nations. One, to take all appropriate steps within a period of three months to launch appropriate, appropriate investigations that are independent and in conformity with international standards into the serious valuation of international human humanitarian and international human rights law reported by the mission. And any other serious allegations that might come to its attention to to inform the Security Council within a further period of three months of action taken or in process of being taken by the government of Israel to inquire into investigate and prosecute such various valuation. The mission further recommends that the Security Council should at the same time establish an independent committee of experts and international humanitarian and human rights law to monitor and report on any domestic legal or other proceedings undertaken by the government of Israel in relation to the aforesaid investigation. So I'm not going to read the rest, but in a nutshell, they are asking separate investigation from each part. So Israel as well as those who were in power at the time in Palestine to investigate what happened between December 2008 and January 2009, I believe. Now mind you that Israel refused to partake in this mission and therefore after that they're claiming to be an anti-Israel biased report, but then they didn't want to partake in any whole let me just come up with facts because then the UN did a general assembly assembly debate on first day November 5 2009 3pm in New York. In this assembly, every single member needed to vote in favor or now of the resolution of this mission. So like I said, asking Israel and Palestine to do independent investigations and then come up with report so then they could further more investigate and come up with a final resolution. A lot of people were in favor of the recommendations that were pointed out by the mission. So I'm not going to give all the countries, but I want to give the countries that were against it. Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Netherlands, Palau, Panama, Poland, Slovakia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Ukraine, the United States of America. Are we surprised? I'm not surprised. Anyhow, before and after the vote, some of the members were able to back up their vote. So basically explain why they decided to vote in favor of staying or refuse the resolution of this act. And one thing that I wanted to highlight is what the Israel representative said. I would like to take this opportunity before the assembly proceeds to the vote to see clarification on on an element contained in operative paragraph four of draft resolution, which is a matter of concern to us and I suspect to other delegations as well. More specifically, we would like to ask who exactly will be the accountable, quote unquote, Palestinian side that would be responsible for undertaking investigations that are independent, credible and in conformity with international standards. Would it be the Palestinian authority that was ousted? Sorry, I don't know how to say this. From Gaza in a violent coup and is now effectively present there, or would it be the Hamas tea organization tea tea entity, which violates every international standard promotes tea, rejects the recognition of Israel and tries to derail the region from the track of the peace process. Israel, through your sir, would like to ask the sponsor of the draft resolution to clarify this critical aspect so that member states of the general assembly will know better, will know better what they will be voting for. The president, I give the floor to the representative of Egypt who presented the draft resolution on behalf of the Arab group and the non-aligned movement. And so the Egyptian representative said, with regards of the operative paragraph four of the draft resolution, the Palestinian authority itself declared that it is going to conduct its own investigation, which is independent, credible and in conformity with international standards. And Hamas, which may be considered an Israel as a tea organization, but is considered the legitimately elected representative of the Palestinian people, has already expressed its willingness to cooperate and to investigate to persecute those that are responsible for such crimes. We would like to hear the same from the representative of Israel. If he can confirm today that Israel is willing to undertake investigation that are independent, credible and in conformity with international standards, international law and international humanitarian law, I think this would be very news to general assembly before voting on the draft resolution. Yeah, and then the conversation goes on and more members defend their vote basically. It's a lot of countries that were in favor. So that was the final resolution that Israel and Palestine need to do their own separate, unbiased investigations. And I just wanted to highlight a few things that some of the state members said. Some of them are very long, but this one is short and it's coming from Malaysia. Malaysia voted in favor of the resolution 6410 because we strongly feel that Israel, the main perpetrator in the Gazan conflict, should be held accountable for the war crimes and gave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, which it had committed during the conflict. In fact, we would have wanted stronger language in the resolution to reflect this view so as not to equate the victims with the perpetrator. Malaysia has always been that girl. Let me tell you. If you want to read all of that, it's available in a shrink in mine profile. And then in the next video, I will talk about the drama that happened after that and also what was the full conclusion of this report and why no actions were taken.",subjective

If you don't know what the Goldstone report is, you can refer back to one of my videos. I explain what the Goldstone report is. In this video, I'm going to be talking about one of three cases that was reported in the Goldstone report of Palestinian civilians being used as human shields during Operation Castlet. To give a little bit more of background information and context before I get into this report, this happened in Jabalya on Elkwood Street, but it's also known as Isbeth Abdul-Bul Street. And the name of the man that gave his testimony, his name is Mejdi Abdul-Bul and his family home is located next to Salah El-Din Mask. And when you hear me say, H-S-07, H-S-08, and H-S-09, this is a coding system that refers to people in places whose names are not disclosed in the document. Mejdi Abdul-Bul, a man aged 39 at the time of the incident, is married and the father of five children, aged between 16 years and 14 months. He is an intelligence officer of the Palestinian Authority. Mejdi Abdul-Bul recanted that around 9.30 a.m. on January 5, 2009, here at Loud Banging on the Averdor of the House. He asked to his at the door and someone responded in Arabic ordering him to open the door. He opened the door and saw in front of him a Palestinian man in handcuffs. When he later found out to be H-S-07, age 20, a group of around 15 Israeli soldiers stood behind H-S-07. One of the soldiers was holding a weapon to his head. The soldiers pushed H-S-07 to one side and four soldiers pointed their weapons at Mejdi Abdul-Bul. They ordered him to address down to his underwear. He was then told to dress again and they pushed him into the house. The soldiers ordered him to call his children one by one. He started with his eldest son, H-16, who was ordered by the soldiers to strip naked. The same process was followed with the two other sons, age 9 and 8. He then called his daughter, age 14, who was told to press her clothes to her body and turn around. His wife, who was holding their baby daughter, was also told to press her clothes to her body and then to take the baby's trousers off. Mejdi Abdul-Bul stated that the soldiers then forced him to walk in front of them as they searched the house, room by room holding a firearm to his head. They questioned him about the house behind his. He told him that the house was empty and that the owner, H-S-08, had been absent for four years working in the Sudan. There was a small gap between the two houses but they were joined at the roof. The soldiers gave him a sledgehammer, the kind used to break stones, and told him to break a hole through the dividing wall into his neighbor's house. While they watched over his shoulders, they had descended only a few steps. However, when the soldiers apparently detected some movement in the house, they started shouting and pulled Mejdi Abdul-Bul back and rushed back into his house over the roof. Mejdi Abdul-Bul then heard some gunshots. The soldiers ran out into the street, forcing Mejdi Abdul-Bul and H-S-07 with them while they were shooting. Both were taken into the adjacent mosque where there were a large number of soldiers with military equipment. They were forced to sit down and then handcuff. The soldiers used the area of the mosque from where the imam leads prayers to fire at Mejdi Abdul-Bul's house and the house next to it. He shouted at the soldiers to stop as his family was still in the house. A soldier told him to shut up or they would shoot him. The shooting continued for around 30 minutes. After a law, the soldiers warned that there would be a huge explosion. And indeed, after about three minutes, there was a huge explosion. The explosion was followed by intensive gunfire and artillery shells. Mejdi Abdul-Bul could not identify the source of the explosion. In the meantime, he had been forced to break a hole in the wall of the mosque on the south side and into the neighboring house. He had then been interrogated about his knowledge of hummus and the location of tunnels. Subsequently, he was taken and detained together with a group of neighbors, men, and women in another house in the neighborhood, the HS09 family home. When the shooting stopped, the soldiers came to fetch him. He was taken to the road next to his house to an empty area behind HS08's house. He saw that HS08's house and the entrance area of his house had been damaged. There were numerous soldiers standing next to the house, including some officers. He saw a senior officer talking to the soldiers who raided his house. And the officer then came to speak to him through an Arabic speaking soldier. The soldiers said that they had killed the fighters inside the house and told them to go into the house and come back with their clothes and weapons. He protested saying that he just wanted to find out if his family was safe. The officer told him to obey their orders. If he ever wanted to see his family again, he refused to go and was kicked and beaten with their weapons until he gave in. He approached HS08's house from the street. The entrance was destroyed and blocked by rubble. He went back to the officer and told him that he could not get in. The officer told him to go through the roof instead. He went into his own house, which he found empty, except for a soldier. This reinforced his anxiety about the fate of his family. At this point, there was no major damage to his house. He crossed the roof and went down the stairs into HS08's house. He was scared that the fighters would shoot at him and shouted, I am a Palestinian enabler. I am being forced to come in this house. In a room at the bottom of the stairs, he found three armed young men wearing military camouflage and headbands of Al-Qasamber gates. They pointed their weapons at him. He told them that the Israeli soldiers thought that they had been killed and had sent him to check. He said that he was helpless and the soldiers had taken his wife and children. The armed men told him that they had seen everything and asked him to go back to the soldiers and tell them what he had seen. He went back outside, again crossing the roof of his house. As he approached the soldiers, they pointed their weapons at him and ordered him to stop, strip naked and turn around. After he dressed again, he told them what he had seen. Initially, the soldiers did not believe him. They asked how he knew that they were Hamas militants. And he explained about their headbands. The soldiers asked about their weapons and he replied that they were carrying Kalashnikovs. The officer told him that if he was lying, he would be shot dead. He was handcuffed and taken back to the HS09 family house for detention. At around 3pm, he had gunfire for about 30 minutes. The soldiers came back to him and took him to the same officer. This time, he noticed different soldiers present with different military equipment. Through the translator, the officer told them that they had killed the militants and told them to go in and bring back their bodies. Again, he refused saying, this isn't my job. I don't want to die. He lied to them saying that the three militants had told them that if he came back, they would kill him. The officer told him that, as they had already killed the militants, he should not worry. He added that they had fired two missiles into the house, which must have killed the militants.",subjective

And if you're not familiar with what the Goldstone report is, it was a report that was published in 2009 that investigated all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law that might have been committed at any time in the context of the military operations that were conducted in Gaza. The president of the Human Rights Council at the time appointed Justice Richard Goldstone to head the mission. Goldstone was a former judge of the Constitutional Court of South Africa and former prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunals for former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The next three members were Professor Christine Chinken, Professor of International Law at the London School of Economics and Political Science, who was a member of the high-level fact-finding mission to bait Hanun, one of the most northern towns in the Gaza Strip and is currently destroyed beyond recognition. Next, Ms. Hina Jalani, advocate of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and former special representative of the Secretary-General on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders, who was a member of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur. And lastly, Colonel Desmond Travers, a former officer in Ireland's Defense Forces and member of the Board of Directors of the Institute for International Criminal Investigations. Quoting the report, the mission interpreted the mandate as requiring it to place the civilian population of the region at the center of its concern regarding the violations of international law. The mission convened for the first time in Geneva between May 4th and 8th, 2009, additionally the mission met in Geneva on May 20th and on July 4th and 5th and between the 1st and 4th of August of 2009. The mission conducted three field visits, two to the Gaza Strip between May 30th and June 6th and between June 25th and July 1st of 2009, and one visit to Aiman, July 2nd and 3rd of 2009. Several staff of the mission secretary were deployed in Gaza from May 22nd to July 4th of 2009 to conduct field investigations. Notes for Bales, a note for Bales is a diplomatic communication from one government to another delivered through each other's diplomatic representatives. Also, I'm very aware of that's a French word, so it literally means verbal note, but this is, you know, fancy way to say it and how they document it within government documents. They were sent to all member states of the United Nations and United Nations organs and bodies on May 7th, 2009 and on June 8th of 2009. The mission issued a call for submissions inviting all interested persons and organizations to submit relevant information and documentation to assist in the implementation of its mandate. Public hearings were held in Gaza June 28th and 29th and in Geneva and July 6th and 7th of 2009. The mission repeatedly sought to obtain the operation of the government of Israel after numerous attempts had failed. The mission sought and obtained the assistance of the government of Egypt to enable it to enter the Gaza Strip to the Rafa Crossing. The mission conducted 188 individual interviews. It reviewed more than 300 reports, submissions and other documentation either research of its own motion, received a reply to its call for submissions and verbal note or provided during meetings or otherwise, amounting to more than 10,000 pages, over 30 videos and 1,200 photographs.",subjective

Despite, Richard Goldstone walking back a lot of his findings, most likely due to serious bullying from the US and Israel, the remainder of his team stood by their initial conclusion. That's why the report is still relevant. On top of that, Amnesty International also found the same conclusions from their own reporting. Also important to mention is that Richard Goldstone has an impressive record in criminal justice, since he was selected by the US to be the first chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Trials for Rwanda and Yugoslavia.",False,,nicgford,Nicholas Ford,,,,,,False,Goldstone Report,2023,@nicgford_video_7304460304346402055.txt," UN Secretary General Antonio Gucheroz recently said, The attacks by Amaz did not happen in a vacuum. Let's look at that. In 2005, Israel placed a blockade on Gaza, and a year later, dove West class, then a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Ehood Olmert, explained that the Israeli policy was designed to put the Palestinians on a diet and not make them die of hunger. In December 2008, Israel broke a ceasefire and launched Operation Cast Lead. Despite a UN fact-finding mission, finding zero evidence of the use of human shields by Hamas, the mission found numerous instances of deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian objects, and that the IDF intentionally bombed the outcodes in Al-Wafah hospitals. The UN mission concluded that the attack was directed at least in part at the people of Gaza and with the intention of spreading terror among the civilian population. A few years later, in 2012, it was revealed that Israel had calculated the minimum caloric intake needed for people in Gaza to avoid malnutrition so that Israel could limit the amount of food entering Gaza, but without causing masturbation. To use later in 2014, Israel launched Operation Protective Edge. They bombed the outcodes in Al-Wafah hospital and then lied about why they bombed it, and they also targeted clearly marked ambulances. In the end, they killed over 2000 Palestinians, mostly civilians. Then in 2018, when Palestinians in Gaza were protesting near the fence, the IDF started shooting at unarmed protesters, including children. This is a video of an IDF sniper shooting a child. It is quite graphic. Mimoni, mole, po, bole, po, bole, po, bole, po. Mimoni, mole, po, bole, po, bole, po. Why is it so done? Yes! Ben said it's done now. And then last year, the IDF assassinated Al-Jazeera journalists Shireen Abu-Akla by shooting her in the head and then lied about it. And all of this is just the tip of the iceberg.",subjective

If you live in the world, please go look up the Goldstone Report, G-O-L-D-S-T-O-N-E from the UN 2009. You can Google it, you can bring it up on your computer, you can print it. I've printed it every single page and read it twice. This report details in length, the genocide that has been going on for decades. Here are 10 things you will find in the Goldstone Report that will change your mind if you still haven't decided. And if you haven't, I really think you did. You just didn't speak up, but here we go. Number 10. Israel uses Palestinian people in a scent civilians as human shields. The UN report documented multiple incidences. Number 9. The UN found that Israel has executed children and babies with bullet wounds straight to the head, sometimes too at a close range. Number 8. Israel has targeted, threatened, and killed journalists and their families. They admitted this this week, but in the UN report, it also does go into multiple incidences where people were taken in, told a self-sensor, all of their materials were stolen, they were beaten unconscious, and they also had to admit that the IDF killed a journalist by shooting her in the head. They blamed a mass for a very long time. It was them. Number 7. Israel has kept humanitarian groups out of Gaza, so they could not report on the conditions of the Palestinian people. And at this time, the number I have for humanitarian workers that have been murdered by Israel in the past 20 days, it is at 54. They have murdered UN teachers, humanitarian aid workers, UN workers. We're not talking about like oops, a bomb was dropped. That's still genocide. No, we're talking about we don't like those fucking UN people in that school, so bomb it. Number 6. The UN went into a whole section called the silent transfer of Jerusalem. What's that? It said that after Israel was through Gaza, it would continue to go after all of the Palestinian people in the West Bank until they all were off the land and gone. Number 5. By cutting off the Palestinian people from the West Bank, the rest of the West Bank, they lost millions of dollars a day in important exports. And Israel controls all of its imports and exports, so as much food as they wanted them to get as much grain, as much medicine. No matter what it was, Israel controlled every single thing in and out of Gaza. Number 4. Israel used to and continues to, well I mean there's nothing left, but they would bomb the factories or the mills that were producing things like wheat so that people didn't have the things they needed. They were trying to starve them without being accused of genocide. You know what I'm saying? For a very long time. Number 4. Israel would murder innocent civilians, and then when they'd go to have the funerals for their loved ones that were dead, they would murder all the people that showed up. Number 3. Israel has been using weapons. You're not allowed to use even in war against civilians, and it's supposed to have some supervision over some of its weapons. You want to hear about those weapons? One of them's white phosphorus. If you haven't had the absolute nightmare of seeing children either live on video or live, covered in white phosphorus, screaming for their lives because their skin is burning, then you just don't know. The report details multiple weapons that they're not supposed to use. White phosphorus indicated that they use so much that often they can get it off the skin and out of the muscle tissue because it burns through it. But once they're good at changing like the child's bandage, it'll just ignite in flames like their whole arm. There are these shrapnel type of weapons that it detailed in there which I heard someone in one of the lives talking about how these weapons are so different. Somebody said something about shrapnel. There was just a lot of shrapnel and it sounds like the one weapon that they detailed in there that literally just like chops bone and can I tell you I saw the bones. I saw the bones myself. I didn't know bones did that, but they did. It also listed Uranium depleted weapons. But it said the UN decided not to go further. And I mean after reading these 432 pages, I would tell you that I'm guessing the UN probably should have gone further, but I don't know. What number are we on to? I'm about to go cry in the shower. There's so many to pick from. I'm just trying to decide in my head. I mentioned that they use Palestinians as human shields. I think they did. I mentioned that I won't count that. It said that at the time in 2008, I think it was something like 40% of the children there were seen as depressed. That's the kids you actually have Israel. Let's see the doctor. And they only had 30 mental health professionals for all 2 million gauzens, 2 million Palestinians. And I guess the first one is that page after page after page they say that according to the Geneva Convention and rules of on war, which by the way it refers to Hamas and other liberation groups as terrorists in quotation marks. And I just say maybe you should google why the fuck they do that. Just because Israel says there are terrorist groups doesn't mean that they're a terrorist group. And I mean it details how Israel tried to create situations over and over again so it would have reason to do this. And I am begging you. I am begging you. For the Holocaust survivor I knew to please wake up and do your goddamn homework because Benjamin Netanyahu is betting you won't ever say no to Israel because you've made associations because you haven't educated yourself. He knows how dumb we are. He knows you learn about the Holocaust in school but you never learn about the state of Israel. So when he decided to start a genocide he knew you would all stay silent while he murdered people live on the internet. Innocent children. Be begging please stop. Where do we go? What do we do? They're in a cage. We're watching a man bomb a cage full of two million people and they still have nowhere to go. You know what that means right? It just ends up there all day.

It's just a long rant of me being fucking shadowed beyond. But anyway, let's talk about this Goldstone report because it just came up on my for you page and I want to talk about it because yeah. So the Goldstone report was a report that came from the number of the UN and done by Richard Goldstone, who was the lead on the project. That's going to become very important later that he was just one of the people on it. It was a report that was looking into the some of the claims in there and it was only supposed to be used as a guideline so that the Hamas and Israel can look into the things. Israel refused to cooperate with the investigation. Claiming anti-Israel basis in the UNHRC. Interesting. In this report, Goldstone accused both Israel, the IDF, and the Palestinian militants of war crimes and possible crimes against the community. It also recommended that each side openly investigation on some contract and to bring allegations to the international criminal court if they felt had failed to do so. The government of Israel, of course, rejected the reports as presidents, prejudice and full of errors. And also sharply rejected the charts and it had a policy of deliberately targeting civilians. Had a policy of deliberately targeting civilians. We're saying that now that there are deliberately targeting civilians. A lot of people have called them on that. What I find interesting is this next thing here. The militant Islamic group of Maas initially rejected some of the reports findings. But then the order to the word powers to embrace it. I'm not going to show you anything from the first one, from the first link later, but I'm going to show you something about the second. This was, you can find this on Rebarchive if you just hit the click. Anya orj, who is the, I think the acting prime minister at the time. Urge word powers on Sunday to embrace a recently released report on the alleged war crimes committed during Israel's recent war on the Gaza Strip. We had hoped the report would not be doomed to the fates of the dozens of reports that Israel has condemned for decades. According to the report of the fact finding mission led by Justice Richard Goldstone. Jew criticism from the U, from the US in Israel for its finding that Israel committed war crimes during the attack of Gaza. So we can now add Obama to the list of politicians that were supporting Israel at the time. It takes something like this to make it that we are complacent the entire time. It takes social media and stuff like this to happen to see that as we look back in history, the United States has been complacent in the entire time. That was released in 2009 and the US rejected this finding. But anyway, let's go back to it. I also find it interesting that Hamas, well they initially rejected some of those findings, but Hamas said, yeah, please look into this. That did the first one that, when they initially said that they were just going to go with what the human rights commission had said, which had stated that they weren't the wrong anyway on some of this, especially about attacking sending rockets over to Israel, but we've had the Iron Dome for years. There's no way there's missiles would have made it there. But anyway, that's beside the point. So what happened to this report? Well I hate to say the bad news about this report because they're sadly bad news to this report. They had voted to not hear anything about it until the next year. And when they went to vote on it and to mandate the country's thought, you look into this, it was rejected. Of course it was. The UK at the time, and I found this fascinating because this is one of the links that I actually looked at. The UK was strongly criticized for abstaining at the time, not making any things that the United States had destroyed it. Yeah. In 2011, Richard Goldstone, sorry, I keep doing that for some reason, Richard Goldstone had come out and had said that the paper was not good. The paper first Goldstone retracted his claim that the Israeli government policy to deliberately target citizens, while the investigations published by the Israeli military and recognized by the UN's community report, have established a ability of some incidents we are that we investigated in cases involving individual soldiers. They also indicate the civilians were not intentionally targeted as matter policy. Investigations published by the Israeli military. 13 days later, the other three co-authors of the report, I don't, I'm not going to try to pronounce any of those names, because I could probably say the last one, but the other ones are not. I released a joint statement criticizing Goldstone's recantations of this aspect of the report. They all agreed that the report was valid and that Israel and Hamas had failed to investigate alleged war crimes, violent, satisfactorily. I will agree that at the time none of this was followed up on and everything, but I find it fascinating that in 2009, there was an attempt to stop this, that a lot of these war crimes could have been stopped, but they weren't. In fact, this very paper was criticized by the United States at the time. I find that fascinating, but at the same time, it lines up with a lot of the stuff that we've been seeing and we know for a long time that the US had been with Israel the entire time committing these war crimes. And that is not including the laws that some states now have that you cannot say anything bad about Israel. Yeah, a foreign nation has it in some states that you cannot talk bad about them.",subjective

Let's take one example. So, in June 2008, there was a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. And by every account, the ceasefire held up for six months until November 4, 2008. Now, you might recall November 4 was election day. And that was the day that Barack Obama became president of the United States. So, all the tension was shifted away from the world and all the spotlight was in our presidential election and its result. What it is we'll do? It did what it always does. It weighed for the right moment and then killed some militants in Gaza. Then, Hamas retaliated. Everybody go back and look at Amnesty International. Everybody agrees the ceasefire broke down on that day and it was Israel who initiated the attack. Why did Israel initiate the attack? Why did it want a breakdown in the ceasefire? Why if there was a ceasefire that Israel wanted the ceasefire to break down? And if you go back and I exhaustively documented it because at that time Israel was not worried about world opinion. The problems with public opinion sitting after Operation Cast Lead with the Goldstone report and I can get to that later. Now, an answer to the question why did Israel attack? The answer was Israel suffered a major defeat in Lebanon. They want to reestablish their deterrence. Yes, they wanted to reestablish what they called the Terrence capacity, which simply is the technical term for the Arab world's fear of Israel. And they were very concerned that after the 2006 Lebanon war, the head of Hezbollah called the Divine Victory, the 34-day war, and the head of Hezbollah, Sad Nasrallah, he mocked Israel and he mocked its fighting capacity. So Israel wanted to restore its deterrence capacity and it shows Gaza as the target. Now, you compare that reality with how any Schumer describes it. They were very honest about what they were doing. They wanted to create a humanitarian crisis in Gaza so as to compel the people of Gaza to overthrow their government. You",subjective

And I feel like probably the worst of them all. How many people know about you, the US that uses anti-boycott laws for Israel or anti-BDS laws? And how many people know what that is? Many United States states are using anti-boycott laws and executive orders to punish companies that refuse to do business with illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank human rights watch set today. This is an article from 2019. So some of this information is going to be wrong, but I will show you the current list of states that have these laws more than 250 million Americans, some 78% of the population live in states with anti-boycott laws are policy 27 states 35 states now have adopted laws or policies that penalize businesses, organizations or individuals that engage in or call for boycotts against Israel. The laws or policies in the in 17 of those states that might be different now. I'm not sure about that number, explicitly target not only companies that refuse to do business in or with Israel, but also those that refuse to do business in Israeli settlements. Some state who law whose laws do not explicitly apply to settlement have also penalized companies that cut settlement tie states with anti-boycott laws are effectively telling companies that if you do the right thing and distangle yourself from settlement. And abuse abuses you can't do business with us says Andrea Parcell deputy US advocacy director at human rights watch. States should encourage not sanctioned companies that avoid contributing to rights abuses. Many states have anti boycott laws or policies that extend to individuals and companies that enter into business contracts with states. These laws and policies require people entering into contracts to assert that they will not engage in any boycott activities. Businesses literally have to put this into their into their law into their policies. In January 2019, the US Senate passed a bill that endorsed state anti-boycott legislation, including those that encompass settlement business activity. In March federal lawmakers introduced resolutions in both the Senate and the House to condemn boycotts of Israel. None of these initiatives has has yet to become US law. Anti boycott laws aim to deter companies from cutting ties to settlements and thereby ending their involvement in human rights abuses there. States should scrap anti boycott laws that penalized companies for taking actions that enter involvement in rights abuses. This chart taken from Wikipedia shows all of the states that currently have anti-BDS laws put into place. Do you know how crazy this is? I literally just learned about this fucking yesterday and I was like, what the fuck are we talking about? What do you mean you can't choose to not do business with Israel? Whoa, wow, wow, what the fuck you mean? And with all of this, let's also take a look at something else that I learned yesterday, which again, just fucking madness, known as the Goldstone Report. After the Gaza War, which took place from December 27th to January 18th of 2009, a UN fact-finding mission headed by Judge Richard Goldstone, was established in 2009. Mary Robertson, the former president of Ireland, had declined an invitation by the UN Human Rights Council to head the committee, saying the mandate was not guided by human rights and international human rights laws, but by politics. Which I think is very interesting when the intentions for this were to essentially figure out whether or not human rights violations were being committed in Israel by the Israeli government as well as Hamas. Israel refused to engage with the mission and denied any understanding of Israel's motives in attacking the Gaza Strip. Israel also barred Goldstone in his colleagues from entering Gaza from Israel, forcing them to travel via Egypt. The embargo on Goldstone was endorsed by Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, and he'd hood-barak, the Defense Minister. But many politicians and commentaries disagreed with the government's refusal to engage with the mission. That is incredibly important. This is also incredibly important to note that prior to what we are now seeing happening in Gaza, there were a lot of Israeli people who felt incredibly negative about Benjamin Netanyahu. So much to the point that there were scheduled protests against him prior to all of this taking place. And when I mean at the same time, I mean what is currently taking place. A lot of this information is coming from 2009 when things like this were, when they had tried to establish this. At the same time, the Israeli army embarked on an unprecedented investigation into its own war crimes, including the puping a civilian to carrying white flags, the shelling of United Nations schools, which was being used as a refuge, and the unallibing of 29 members of Al Samooni family. The report called for both parties Hamas and Israel to investigate their own actions and accuse both of deliberately targeting civilians. Goldstone was vilified by pro-Israel groups as a self-hating Jew. And his report was likened to the blood to a blood liable, a false charge against Jews with roots in medieval anti-Semitism. Nevertheless, the report galvanized Israel to start investigations into the charges that were made against its military operation, which are still ongoing. Which I think is absolutely fucking mad to ask the groups that you are claiming are enacting human rights violations to investigate themselves. That's fucking not. What he wrote in his initial statement that Israel was targeting civilians, he later retracted. He wrote that the report's initial findings that Israel intentionally targeted civilians was wrong. And he praised Israel for investigating allegations against it while criticizing Hamas for failing to do the same. Goldstone's apparent and quotations, retraction, was met with jubilation in Israel. Goldstone later informed the media that he did not speak directly with Yish Hay who does not speak English and insisted he stood by the report. There is so much mystery shrouding this report. It seems like this man was backed into a corner in blackmail to unsave the things that he had written about. I just want people to be aware that there is so much at play when it comes to this conversation. The level of intimidation that is used to stop even businesses from being able to talk about it with the anti-BDS laws or when a person tries to come through and talk about human rights violations occurring, they later retract all of a sudden. This man wasn't even allowed to go to his own grandson's bar mitzvah in South Africa because of what he had stated. We need to be incredibly critical of everything we are seeing. It is very obvious that there are laws in place that do not allow you to disparage the Israeli government. It is incredibly apparent. So continue to talk about these things guys and continue to stay safe.",subjective

This is gonna be a long video, so if you want to speed up the video, if I start rambling, or if you have the attention spawn of a toddler, but I will start by talking about what was at the end of the report, like the suggestions from the mission. If you don't know what I'm talking about, please watch this video that I made a few days ago about the Goldstone Report. I will be quoting a lot of this document because unlike the Israeli government, we like to come up with receipts and everything that I'm talking about in this video will be in the shmink in my profile. The Goldstone Report is available in multiple languages. It's available in Arabic, English, French, Spanish, Russian and Chinese as well. So if you want to download all of that, again, it's in the shmink in my profile, but without further ado, let's go. So at the end of the report, the mission gives recommendation to the United Nation as well as the Human Rights Council. I'm just gonna read a few sections and then we will go to the resolution. So there was a meeting that was held after this. And yeah, that's what we're mainly gonna talk about today. But so in the Goldstone Report section 1969 to the United Nations Security Council, a, the mission recommends that the Security Council should require the government of Israel under Article 40 of the character of the United Nations. One, to take all appropriate steps within a period of three months to launch appropriate, appropriate investigations that are independent and in conformity with international standards into the serious valuation of international human humanitarian and international human rights law reported by the mission. And any other serious allegations that might come to its attention to to inform the Security Council within a further period of three months of action taken or in process of being taken by the government of Israel to inquire into investigate and prosecute such various valuation. The mission further recommends that the Security Council should at the same time establish an independent committee of experts and international humanitarian and human rights law to monitor and report on any domestic legal or other proceedings undertaken by the government of Israel in relation to the aforesaid investigation. So I'm not going to read the rest, but in a nutshell, they are asking separate investigation from each part. So Israel as well as those who were in power at the time in Palestine to investigate what happened between December 2008 and January 2009, I believe. Now mind you that Israel refused to partake in this mission and therefore after that they're claiming to be an anti-Israel biased report, but then they didn't want to partake in any whole let me just come up with facts because then the UN did a general assembly assembly debate on first day November 5 2009 3pm in New York. In this assembly, every single member needed to vote in favor or now of the resolution of this mission. So like I said, asking Israel and Palestine to do independent investigations and then come up with report so then they could further more investigate and come up with a final resolution. A lot of people were in favor of the recommendations that were pointed out by the mission. So I'm not going to give all the countries, but I want to give the countries that were against it. Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Netherlands, Palau, Panama, Poland, Slovakia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Ukraine, the United States of America. Are we surprised? I'm not surprised. Anyhow, before and after the vote, some of the members were able to back up their vote. So basically explain why they decided to vote in favor of staying or refuse the resolution of this act. And one thing that I wanted to highlight is what the Israel representative said. I would like to take this opportunity before the assembly proceeds to the vote to see clarification on on an element contained in operative paragraph four of draft resolution, which is a matter of concern to us and I suspect to other delegations as well. More specifically, we would like to ask who exactly will be the accountable, quote unquote, Palestinian side that would be responsible for undertaking investigations that are independent, credible and in conformity with international standards. Would it be the Palestinian authority that was ousted? Sorry, I don't know how to say this. From Gaza in a violent coup and is now effectively present there, or would it be the Hamas tea organization tea tea entity, which violates every international standard promotes tea, rejects the recognition of Israel and tries to derail the region from the track of the peace process. Israel, through your sir, would like to ask the sponsor of the draft resolution to clarify this critical aspect so that member states of the general assembly will know better, will know better what they will be voting for. The president, I give the floor to the representative of Egypt who presented the draft resolution on behalf of the Arab group and the non-aligned movement. And so the Egyptian representative said, with regards of the operative paragraph four of the draft resolution, the Palestinian authority itself declared that it is going to conduct its own investigation, which is independent, credible and in conformity with international standards. And Hamas, which may be considered an Israel as a tea organization, but is considered the legitimately elected representative of the Palestinian people, has already expressed its willingness to cooperate and to investigate to persecute those that are responsible for such crimes. We would like to hear the same from the representative of Israel. If he can confirm today that Israel is willing to undertake investigation that are independent, credible and in conformity with international standards, international law and international humanitarian law, I think this would be very news to general assembly before voting on the draft resolution. Yeah, and then the conversation goes on and more members defend their vote basically. It's a lot of countries that were in favor. So that was the final resolution that Israel and Palestine need to do their own separate, unbiased investigations. And I just wanted to highlight a few things that some of the state members said. Some of them are very long, but this one is short and it's coming from Malaysia. Malaysia voted in favor of the resolution 6410 because we strongly feel that Israel, the main perpetrator in the Gazan conflict, should be held accountable for the war crimes and gave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, which it had committed during the conflict. In fact, we would have wanted stronger language in the resolution to reflect this view so as not to equate the victims with the perpetrator. Malaysia has always been that girl. Let me tell you. If you want to read all of that, it's available in a shrink in mine profile. And then in the next video, I will talk about the drama that happened after that and also what was the full conclusion of this report and why no actions were taken.",subjective

If you don't know what the Goldstone report is, you can refer back to one of my videos. I explain what the Goldstone report is. In this video, I'm going to be talking about one of three cases that was reported in the Goldstone report of Palestinian civilians being used as human shields during Operation Castlet. To give a little bit more of background information and context before I get into this report, this happened in Jabalya on Elkwood Street, but it's also known as Isbeth Abdul-Bul Street. And the name of the man that gave his testimony, his name is Mejdi Abdul-Bul and his family home is located next to Salah El-Din Mask. And when you hear me say, H-S-07, H-S-08, and H-S-09, this is a coding system that refers to people in places whose names are not disclosed in the document. Mejdi Abdul-Bul, a man aged 39 at the time of the incident, is married and the father of five children, aged between 16 years and 14 months. He is an intelligence officer of the Palestinian Authority. Mejdi Abdul-Bul recanted that around 9.30 a.m. on January 5, 2009, here at Loud Banging on the Averdor of the House. He asked to his at the door and someone responded in Arabic ordering him to open the door. He opened the door and saw in front of him a Palestinian man in handcuffs. When he later found out to be H-S-07, age 20, a group of around 15 Israeli soldiers stood behind H-S-07. One of the soldiers was holding a weapon to his head. The soldiers pushed H-S-07 to one side and four soldiers pointed their weapons at Mejdi Abdul-Bul. They ordered him to address down to his underwear. He was then told to dress again and they pushed him into the house. The soldiers ordered him to call his children one by one. He started with his eldest son, H-16, who was ordered by the soldiers to strip naked. The same process was followed with the two other sons, age 9 and 8. He then called his daughter, age 14, who was told to press her clothes to her body and turn around. His wife, who was holding their baby daughter, was also told to press her clothes to her body and then to take the baby's trousers off. Mejdi Abdul-Bul stated that the soldiers then forced him to walk in front of them as they searched the house, room by room holding a firearm to his head. They questioned him about the house behind his. He told him that the house was empty and that the owner, H-S-08, had been absent for four years working in the Sudan. There was a small gap between the two houses but they were joined at the roof. The soldiers gave him a sledgehammer, the kind used to break stones, and told him to break a hole through the dividing wall into his neighbor's house. While they watched over his shoulders, they had descended only a few steps. However, when the soldiers apparently detected some movement in the house, they started shouting and pulled Mejdi Abdul-Bul back and rushed back into his house over the roof. Mejdi Abdul-Bul then heard some gunshots. The soldiers ran out into the street, forcing Mejdi Abdul-Bul and H-S-07 with them while they were shooting. Both were taken into the adjacent mosque where there were a large number of soldiers with military equipment. They were forced to sit down and then handcuff. The soldiers used the area of the mosque from where the imam leads prayers to fire at Mejdi Abdul-Bul's house and the house next to it. He shouted at the soldiers to stop as his family was still in the house. A soldier told him to shut up or they would shoot him. The shooting continued for around 30 minutes. After a law, the soldiers warned that there would be a huge explosion. And indeed, after about three minutes, there was a huge explosion. The explosion was followed by intensive gunfire and artillery shells. Mejdi Abdul-Bul could not identify the source of the explosion. In the meantime, he had been forced to break a hole in the wall of the mosque on the south side and into the neighboring house. He had then been interrogated about his knowledge of hummus and the location of tunnels. Subsequently, he was taken and detained together with a group of neighbors, men, and women in another house in the neighborhood, the HS09 family home. When the shooting stopped, the soldiers came to fetch him. He was taken to the road next to his house to an empty area behind HS08's house. He saw that HS08's house and the entrance area of his house had been damaged. There were numerous soldiers standing next to the house, including some officers. He saw a senior officer talking to the soldiers who raided his house. And the officer then came to speak to him through an Arabic speaking soldier. The soldiers said that they had killed the fighters inside the house and told them to go into the house and come back with their clothes and weapons. He protested saying that he just wanted to find out if his family was safe. The officer told him to obey their orders. If he ever wanted to see his family again, he refused to go and was kicked and beaten with their weapons until he gave in. He approached HS08's house from the street. The entrance was destroyed and blocked by rubble. He went back to the officer and told him that he could not get in. The officer told him to go through the roof instead. He went into his own house, which he found empty, except for a soldier. This reinforced his anxiety about the fate of his family. At this point, there was no major damage to his house. He crossed the roof and went down the stairs into HS08's house. He was scared that the fighters would shoot at him and shouted, I am a Palestinian enabler. I am being forced to come in this house. In a room at the bottom of the stairs, he found three armed young men wearing military camouflage and headbands of Al-Qasamber gates. They pointed their weapons at him. He told them that the Israeli soldiers thought that they had been killed and had sent him to check. He said that he was helpless and the soldiers had taken his wife and children. The armed men told him that they had seen everything and asked him to go back to the soldiers and tell them what he had seen. He went back outside, again crossing the roof of his house. As he approached the soldiers, they pointed their weapons at him and ordered him to stop, strip naked and turn around. After he dressed again, he told them what he had seen. Initially, the soldiers did not believe him. They asked how he knew that they were Hamas militants. And he explained about their headbands. The soldiers asked about their weapons and he replied that they were carrying Kalashnikovs. The officer told him that if he was lying, he would be shot dead. He was handcuffed and taken back to the HS09 family house for detention. At around 3pm, he had gunfire for about 30 minutes. The soldiers came back to him and took him to the same officer. This time, he noticed different soldiers present with different military equipment. Through the translator, the officer told them that they had killed the militants and told them to go in and bring back their bodies. Again, he refused saying, this isn't my job. I don't want to die. He lied to them saying that the three militants had told them that if he came back, they would kill him. The officer told him that, as they had already killed the militants, he should not worry. He added that they had fired two missiles into the house, which must have killed the militants.",subjective

And if you're not familiar with what the Goldstone report is, it was a report that was published in 2009 that investigated all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law that might have been committed at any time in the context of the military operations that were conducted in Gaza. The president of the Human Rights Council at the time appointed Justice Richard Goldstone to head the mission. Goldstone was a former judge of the Constitutional Court of South Africa and former prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunals for former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The next three members were Professor Christine Chinken, Professor of International Law at the London School of Economics and Political Science, who was a member of the high-level fact-finding mission to bait Hanun, one of the most northern towns in the Gaza Strip and is currently destroyed beyond recognition. Next, Ms. Hina Jalani, advocate of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and former special representative of the Secretary-General on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders, who was a member of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur. And lastly, Colonel Desmond Travers, a former officer in Ireland's Defense Forces and member of the Board of Directors of the Institute for International Criminal Investigations. Quoting the report, the mission interpreted the mandate as requiring it to place the civilian population of the region at the center of its concern regarding the violations of international law. The mission convened for the first time in Geneva between May 4th and 8th, 2009, additionally the mission met in Geneva on May 20th and on July 4th and 5th and between the 1st and 4th of August of 2009. The mission conducted three field visits, two to the Gaza Strip between May 30th and June 6th and between June 25th and July 1st of 2009, and one visit to Aiman, July 2nd and 3rd of 2009. Several staff of the mission secretary were deployed in Gaza from May 22nd to July 4th of 2009 to conduct field investigations. Notes for Bales, a note for Bales is a diplomatic communication from one government to another delivered through each other's diplomatic representatives. Also, I'm very aware of that's a French word, so it literally means verbal note, but this is, you know, fancy way to say it and how they document it within government documents. They were sent to all member states of the United Nations and United Nations organs and bodies on May 7th, 2009 and on June 8th of 2009. The mission issued a call for submissions inviting all interested persons and organizations to submit relevant information and documentation to assist in the implementation of its mandate. Public hearings were held in Gaza June 28th and 29th and in Geneva and July 6th and 7th of 2009. The mission repeatedly sought to obtain the operation of the government of Israel after numerous attempts had failed. The mission sought and obtained the assistance of the government of Egypt to enable it to enter the Gaza Strip to the Rafa Crossing. The mission conducted 188 individual interviews. It reviewed more than 300 reports, submissions and other documentation either research of its own motion, received a reply to its call for submissions and verbal note or provided during meetings or otherwise, amounting to more than 10,000 pages, over 30 videos and 1,200 photographs.",subjective

Despite, Richard Goldstone walking back a lot of his findings, most likely due to serious bullying from the US and Israel, the remainder of his team stood by their initial conclusion. That's why the report is still relevant. On top of that, Amnesty International also found the same conclusions from their own reporting. Also important to mention is that Richard Goldstone has an impressive record in criminal justice, since he was selected by the US to be the first chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Trials for Rwanda and Yugoslavia.",False,,nicgford,Nicholas Ford,,,,,,False,Goldstone Report,2023,@nicgford_video_7304460304346402055.txt," UN Secretary General Antonio Gucheroz recently said, The attacks by Amaz did not happen in a vacuum. Let's look at that. In 2005, Israel placed a blockade on Gaza, and a year later, dove West class, then a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Ehood Olmert, explained that the Israeli policy was designed to put the Palestinians on a diet and not make them die of hunger. In December 2008, Israel broke a ceasefire and launched Operation Cast Lead. Despite a UN fact-finding mission, finding zero evidence of the use of human shields by Hamas, the mission found numerous instances of deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian objects, and that the IDF intentionally bombed the outcodes in Al-Wafah hospitals. The UN mission concluded that the attack was directed at least in part at the people of Gaza and with the intention of spreading terror among the civilian population. A few years later, in 2012, it was revealed that Israel had calculated the minimum caloric intake needed for people in Gaza to avoid malnutrition so that Israel could limit the amount of food entering Gaza, but without causing masturbation. To use later in 2014, Israel launched Operation Protective Edge. They bombed the outcodes in Al-Wafah hospital and then lied about why they bombed it, and they also targeted clearly marked ambulances. In the end, they killed over 2000 Palestinians, mostly civilians. Then in 2018, when Palestinians in Gaza were protesting near the fence, the IDF started shooting at unarmed protesters, including children. This is a video of an IDF sniper shooting a child. It is quite graphic. Mimoni, mole, po, bole, po, bole, po, bole, po. Mimoni, mole, po, bole, po, bole, po. Why is it so done? Yes! Ben said it's done now. And then last year, the IDF assassinated Al-Jazeera journalists Shireen Abu-Akla by shooting her in the head and then lied about it. And all of this is just the tip of the iceberg.",subjective

If you live in the world, please go look up the Goldstone Report, G-O-L-D-S-T-O-N-E from the UN 2009. You can Google it, you can bring it up on your computer, you can print it. I've printed it every single page and read it twice. This report details in length, the genocide that has been going on for decades. Here are 10 things you will find in the Goldstone Report that will change your mind if you still haven't decided. And if you haven't, I really think you did. You just didn't speak up, but here we go. Number 10. Israel uses Palestinian people in a scent civilians as human shields. The UN report documented multiple incidences. Number 9. The UN found that Israel has executed children and babies with bullet wounds straight to the head, sometimes too at a close range. Number 8. Israel has targeted, threatened, and killed journalists and their families. They admitted this this week, but in the UN report, it also does go into multiple incidences where people were taken in, told a self-sensor, all of their materials were stolen, they were beaten unconscious, and they also had to admit that the IDF killed a journalist by shooting her in the head. They blamed a mass for a very long time. It was them. Number 7. Israel has kept humanitarian groups out of Gaza, so they could not report on the conditions of the Palestinian people. And at this time, the number I have for humanitarian workers that have been murdered by Israel in the past 20 days, it is at 54. They have murdered UN teachers, humanitarian aid workers, UN workers. We're not talking about like oops, a bomb was dropped. That's still genocide. No, we're talking about we don't like those fucking UN people in that school, so bomb it. Number 6. The UN went into a whole section called the silent transfer of Jerusalem. What's that? It said that after Israel was through Gaza, it would continue to go after all of the Palestinian people in the West Bank until they all were off the land and gone. Number 5. By cutting off the Palestinian people from the West Bank, the rest of the West Bank, they lost millions of dollars a day in important exports. And Israel controls all of its imports and exports, so as much food as they wanted them to get as much grain, as much medicine. No matter what it was, Israel controlled every single thing in and out of Gaza. Number 4. Israel used to and continues to, well I mean there's nothing left, but they would bomb the factories or the mills that were producing things like wheat so that people didn't have the things they needed. They were trying to starve them without being accused of genocide. You know what I'm saying? For a very long time. Number 4. Israel would murder innocent civilians, and then when they'd go to have the funerals for their loved ones that were dead, they would murder all the people that showed up. Number 3. Israel has been using weapons. You're not allowed to use even in war against civilians, and it's supposed to have some supervision over some of its weapons. You want to hear about those weapons? One of them's white phosphorus. If you haven't had the absolute nightmare of seeing children either live on video or live, covered in white phosphorus, screaming for their lives because their skin is burning, then you just don't know. The report details multiple weapons that they're not supposed to use. White phosphorus indicated that they use so much that often they can get it off the skin and out of the muscle tissue because it burns through it. But once they're good at changing like the child's bandage, it'll just ignite in flames like their whole arm. There are these shrapnel type of weapons that it detailed in there which I heard someone in one of the lives talking about how these weapons are so different. Somebody said something about shrapnel. There was just a lot of shrapnel and it sounds like the one weapon that they detailed in there that literally just like chops bone and can I tell you I saw the bones. I saw the bones myself. I didn't know bones did that, but they did. It also listed Uranium depleted weapons. But it said the UN decided not to go further. And I mean after reading these 432 pages, I would tell you that I'm guessing the UN probably should have gone further, but I don't know. What number are we on to? I'm about to go cry in the shower. There's so many to pick from. I'm just trying to decide in my head. I mentioned that they use Palestinians as human shields. I think they did. I mentioned that I won't count that. It said that at the time in 2008, I think it was something like 40% of the children there were seen as depressed. That's the kids you actually have Israel. Let's see the doctor. And they only had 30 mental health professionals for all 2 million gauzens, 2 million Palestinians. And I guess the first one is that page after page after page they say that according to the Geneva Convention and rules of on war, which by the way it refers to Hamas and other liberation groups as terrorists in quotation marks. And I just say maybe you should google why the fuck they do that. Just because Israel says there are terrorist groups doesn't mean that they're a terrorist group. And I mean it details how Israel tried to create situations over and over again so it would have reason to do this. And I am begging you. I am begging you. For the Holocaust survivor I knew to please wake up and do your goddamn homework because Benjamin Netanyahu is betting you won't ever say no to Israel because you've made associations because you haven't educated yourself. He knows how dumb we are. He knows you learn about the Holocaust in school but you never learn about the state of Israel. So when he decided to start a genocide he knew you would all stay silent while he murdered people live on the internet. Innocent children. Be begging please stop. Where do we go? What do we do? They're in a cage. We're watching a man bomb a cage full of two million people and they still have nowhere to go. You know what that means right? It just ends up there all day. Like I don't know how people are just watching this not knowing what's going to happen. They're bulldozing them. Bulldozing people and their buildings. This is a genocide but if you'd like to make your own decision I would recommend you google the gold stone report. It's by section. Free Palestine.",subjective

Because he's white, dude. So they like to be very descriptive when they're breaking humanitarian laws. So it just pretty much says that they're going to go through and then take the West Bank and then they plan on taking it all. Yep. We've known this for almost 20 years.

So the Goldstone report was a report that came from the number of the UN and done by Richard Goldstone, who was the lead on the project. That's going to become very important later that he was just one of the people on it. It was a report that was looking into the some of the claims in there and it was only supposed to be used as a guideline so that the Hamas and Israel can look into the things. Israel refused to cooperate with the investigation. Claiming anti-Israel basis in the UNHRC. Interesting. In this report, Goldstone accused both Israel, the IDF, and the Palestinian militants of war crimes and possible crimes against the community. It also recommended that each side openly investigation on some contract and to bring allegations to the international criminal court if they felt had failed to do so. The government of Israel, of course, rejected the reports as presidents, prejudice and full of errors. And also sharply rejected the charts and it had a policy of deliberately targeting civilians. Had a policy of deliberately targeting civilians. We're saying that now that there are deliberately targeting civilians. A lot of people have called them on that. What I find interesting is this next thing here. The militant Islamic group of Maas initially rejected some of the reports findings. But then the order to the word powers to embrace it. I'm not going to show you anything from the first one, from the first link later, but I'm going to show you something about the second. This was, you can find this on Rebarchive if you just hit the click. Anya orj, who is the, I think the acting prime minister at the time. Urge word powers on Sunday to embrace a recently released report on the alleged war crimes committed during Israel's recent war on the Gaza Strip. We had hoped the report would not be doomed to the fates of the dozens of reports that Israel has condemned for decades. According to the report of the fact finding mission led by Justice Richard Goldstone. Jew criticism from the U, from the US in Israel for its finding that Israel committed war crimes during the attack of Gaza. So we can now add Obama to the list of politicians that were supporting Israel at the time. It takes something like this to make it that we are complacent the entire time. It takes social media and stuff like this to happen to see that as we look back in history, the United States has been complacent in the entire time. That was released in 2009 and the US rejected this finding. But anyway, let's go back to it. I also find it interesting that Hamas, well they initially rejected some of those findings, but Hamas said, yeah, please look into this. That did the first one that, when they initially said that they were just going to go with what the human rights commission had said, which had stated that they weren't the wrong anyway on some of this, especially about attacking sending rockets over to Israel, but we've had the Iron Dome for years. There's no way there's missiles would have made it there. But anyway, that's beside the point. So what happened to this report? Well I hate to say the bad news about this report because they're sadly bad news to this report. They had voted to not hear anything about it until the next year. And when they went to vote on it and to mandate the country's thought, you look into this, it was rejected. Of course it was. The UK at the time, and I found this fascinating because this is one of the links that I actually looked at. The UK was strongly criticized for abstaining at the time, not making any things that the United States had destroyed it. Yeah. In 2011, Richard Goldstone, sorry, I keep doing that for some reason, Richard Goldstone had come out and had said that the paper was not good. The paper first Goldstone retracted his claim that the Israeli government policy to deliberately target citizens, while the investigations published by the Israeli military and recognized by the UN's community report, have established a ability of some incidents we are that we investigated in cases involving individual soldiers. They also indicate the civilians were not intentionally targeted as matter policy. Investigations published by the Israeli military. 13 days later, the other three co-authors of the report, I don't, I'm not going to try to pronounce any of those names, because I could probably say the last one, but the other ones are not. I released a joint statement criticizing Goldstone's recantations of this aspect of the report. They all agreed that the report was valid and that Israel and Hamas had failed to investigate alleged war crimes, violent, satisfactorily. I will agree that at the time none of this was followed up on and everything, but I find it fascinating that in 2009, there was an attempt to stop this, that a lot of these war crimes could have been stopped, but they weren't. In fact, this very paper was criticized by the United States at the time. I find that fascinating, but at the same time, it lines up with a lot of the stuff that we've been seeing and we know for a long time that the US had been with Israel the entire time committing these war crimes. And that is not including the laws that some states now have that you cannot say anything bad about Israel. Yeah, a foreign nation has it in some states that you cannot talk bad about them.",subjective

Let's take one example. So, in June 2008, there was a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. And by every account, the ceasefire held up for six months until November 4, 2008. Now, you might recall November 4 was election day. And that was the day that Barack Obama became president of the United States. So, all the tension was shifted away from the world and all the spotlight was in our presidential election and its result. What it is we'll do? It did what it always does. It weighed for the right moment and then killed some militants in Gaza. Then, Hamas retaliated. Everybody go back and look at Amnesty International. Everybody agrees the ceasefire broke down on that day and it was Israel who initiated the attack. Why did Israel initiate the attack? Why did it want a breakdown in the ceasefire? Why if there was a ceasefire that Israel wanted the ceasefire to break down? And if you go back and I exhaustively documented it because at that time Israel was not worried about world opinion. The problems with public opinion sitting after Operation Cast Lead with the Goldstone report and I can get to that later. Now, an answer to the question why did Israel attack? The answer was Israel suffered a major defeat in Lebanon. They want to reestablish their deterrence. Yes, they wanted to reestablish what they called the Terrence capacity, which simply is the technical term for the Arab world's fear of Israel. And they were very concerned that after the 2006 Lebanon war, the head of Hezbollah called the Divine Victory, the 34-day war, and the head of Hezbollah, Sad Nasrallah, he mocked Israel and he mocked its fighting capacity. So Israel wanted to restore its deterrence capacity and it shows Gaza as the target. Now, you compare that reality with how any Schumer describes it. They were very honest about what they were doing. They wanted to create a humanitarian crisis in Gaza so as to compel the people of Gaza to overthrow their government. You",subjective

They know all the cameras are riveted on the White House, we're riveted on the United States. And then they go in, kill six Hamas militants knowing full well that there's going to be a reaction. And from that point on it descends into TIT for TAT and then on December 26th begins the assault. It ends January 17th. For the time, for that time, it was by far the biggest Israeli massacre committed against Gaza. And you have to bear in mind, I'm not sure how vivid your memory is, even mine is beginning to fade on it. And I studied pretty closely, public opinion radically shifted against Israel after Operation Castlet. It created a huge international uproar. There were believability casualties in November. The death, destruction, there were about 6300 homes that were destroyed. 10 Israeli civilian casualties, Palestinians 1400, from up to 1200, were civilians, 350 children were killed. They estimate about 600,000 tons of rubble were left behind. And there were about three, believe it or not, there were about 300 human rights reports issued on what happened. And if you look at the proportions in my book, you'll see Operation Castlet, it's exhaustively documented across four chapters, large chapters, because there was a huge amount of information and a climax in the Goldstone report. And the Goldstone report was a catastrophe for the state of Israel. Goldstone is Jewish. Goldstone is a Zionist. Goldstone is a liberal. Goldstone was a judge. He was a judge, respected, you can even say renowned judge. And so, and most important, he's a Zionist. He's on the board of directors of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and so on and so forth. And now he came out with a report that said, the purpose of Castlet was to punish, humiliate, and terrorize the civilian population, total disaster for Israel. And so Israel goes at him ferociously. And this he came out with the report in? The report comes out in 2009. They go, Israel goes after him ferociously across the spectrum, across the political spectrum, all levels of the Israeli society, and also in the United States. They go after Goldstone. And the tragedy then occurs. I go through the record very carefully in the book. Goldstone was almost a joke, because it was April 1st. It was April Fool's Day. He drops a bombshell in the Washington Post. This is 2011. He doesn't say it literally, but it's clear the message he's transmitting. He's recanting the report. And he's taking it back. I'll tell you. I remember that day quite well. I was in a library. I don't remember where. And it was like something died in me. Really, it was like something died in me, something you believed in. Or you wanted to believe in. And maybe I was naive. But the Goldstone report was a very weighty document. At one point Benjamin Netanyahu said, we have, we're facing three existential threats. Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah rockets, and the Goldstone report. And it was a very big problem for them. You might recall, this was the point when, like, when Sidby Livney visited the UK, she was hit with an indictment for war crimes under the universal jurisdiction. And explain who she was. Sidby Livney was the foreign minister during the Operation Castlet. And she was a really wretched human being. The day after Castlet, the day after the end of January 18th, she went on Israeli television channel 10. And she boasted, we carried on like real hooligans in Gaza. She boasted, we went wild in Gaza. I ordered it. I'm proud of it because they're so brazen. They're so brazen because they have the United States protecting them. And they carry on with this kind of impunity.",subjective

It is a misrepresentation of the strength of the case against Israel, just like the majority of the quotes they have in this case are. And also, you said it was an extremely well-founded case. They spend like one-fourth of all of the quotations, some even pulled from the Goldstone report that actually deal with the intent part, which is, by the way, I think you guys, I don't know if you use the phrase, the Dolos Specialos, that the intentional part of genocide, I think it's called Dolos Specialos. It's the most important part of genocide, which is proving the highly-special intent to commit genocide. It's possible in Israel, but it's mens-relium. No. The mens-relium, yes, I understand the state of mind, but for genocide, there is, it's called Dolos Specialos, it's a highly-special intent. Did you read the case? It is a highly-special intent. I'm going to ask you again, please stop displaying your imbicility. I'm sorry. You think the death rate should have put on public display that you're a moron. At least have the self-possession to shut up. I read the case- I'm talking about my misplay on camera, you're opening yours in books. Okay? I read the case around four times. I read all of the majority opinion, the declarations. I read Aaron Barak's declaration. Then why are you following in saying plausible? I standard. Because I said, even reaching the benchmark of plausibility is a very high standard in the world. It's the equivalent of a regional player qualifying for an Olympics. There are still two steps removed. You may not be on the team and you may not get a medal, but to get qualified, which in this context is the equivalent of plausible, you must be doing something pretty horrible. As it happens, as it happens for the players, as it was, as it was the court will rule. Remember what I just told you? I don't expect to be even around when the court reaches its final decision. Why? They'll take a long, long time. Two years, three years. No, I don't think they'll take two or three years. I mean, the Bosnia, which was admittedly a special type of case because they were accusing Serbia of sponsoring the Bosnia Serbs. That took, I think, 17 years from 90 years. I assume they'll take two or three years. But the point you're making, so this is a legal thing. The horrible must be happening, even the cheating horrible. It's a war. I know it's terrible. But I think they weren't rendering a ruling on the war. They were rendering a ruling on the genocide. And I think they suggested it. They said it was plausible. They also said it was probable that Israel is committing a murder operation as well. Yeah, but I think the problem with your characterization is you're saying in so many words, South Africans basically only have to show up in court with a coherent statement. Right. That is correct. That's probable. They need to do a lot more. They need it to persuade. The American judge is apt. The American judge is apt. The American judge is apt. The A's are apt persuade. The judges go according to what the majority want to hear. They're just not the president. They need it to persuade the court that it was worth investing several years of their time in hearing this case to us. They're well paid whether they take this case or not. I mean, you know, they have a full docket whether they accept or reject this case. And I think I don't think we should remember what I just said. They won't rule. There was genocide. Remember what I said. Also, I recommend people actually read the case and follow through a lot of the quotes that they just don't show genocide. I don't think so.

Okay. At a meeting of the Israeli cabinet that quote, we need to deal a blow that hasn't been seen in 50 years and take down Gaza and quote, but again, if you click through and you read the source, their own link source, it says as per the zone source, quote, the powerful finance minister, subtler leader, uh, Bessel, all smoker, I can't believe it. Demanded at the cabinet meeting late Saturday that the army quote hit Hamas brutally and not take the matter of the captives in the significant consideration and quote, quote, in war as in war, you have to be brutal and quote, he was quoted as saying, quote, we need to deal a blow that hasn't been seen in 50 years and take down Gaza and quote, you can't strip. The quotation of Hamas, a entity that you're at war with and then there's just a single tank. That's not how that's all genocide. So when you create a, when you create a, when you go, that's not genocide. No. When you claim says we need to defeat Russia, is that genocide? Or they mean filling all Russian sense? Professor Mar was here. This is another one. When the defense, yet ridiculous, yes, ridiculous. The American judge, he also doesn't determine policy. The American judge, the American judge read. You are holding the American judge to, you know, she was the president. He'll show authority when it appears to them and we won't deal with the actual facts of the matter ever. Okay. The American judge read several of the quotes. Look at the American Supreme Court today. They may support Trump. Okay. Okay. Okay. Professor Mar, we're out going too far afield. If you heard a statement by the defense minister, the defense minister said, we are going to prevent any food, water, fuel or electricity from entering the DOS. He wanted to make it. He did Israel do that. Okay. No, I'm wondering what he said. I'm asking you isn't Israeli government policy. What we're talking about statements now, intent. How would you interpret that? After 1200 of your citizens are murdered the way they were, I would expect extreme statements by lots of politicians. But, but you're, by lots of politicians. But you don't accept extreme policy. But that's not a very follow-up way. But you don't accept. What he said isn't Israeli policy. They let in water. They let in gas. I'm sure. We don't accept. We don't accept extreme Palestinian statements after they lost their entire country, not just 1200 people. That's a good point. No, no, it's a good point.

But in particular Gaza. Israel hasn't just been committing war crimes. They've also been committing crimes against humanity. In the Goldstone Report on page 259, we can read along together. Section 1218. People in Gaza, as in other parts of occupied Palestinian territory, have been living under foreign occupation for decades and enduring restrictions and other effects of the policies implemented by the occupying power of Israel. While the start of the blockade and the most recent military operations have undoubtedly added to those restrictions and scarcely, people in Gaza have not been living in what can be called a normal situation for a long time. Section 1219. The restrictions imposed by Israel on the imports to an export from the Gaza Strip to the border crossing as well as the naval and airspace blockade have had severe impacts on the availability and accessibility of a whole range of goods and services necessary for the people of Gaza to enjoy their human rights. There already eroded ability to access and by basic, goods was compounded by the effects of the four-week Israeli military campaign, which further restricted access to those essential items and destroyed goods, land, facilities, and infrastructures vital for the enjoyment of their fundamental rights. In conjunction, the blockade and the military hostilities have created a situation in which most people are destitute. Women and children have been particularly affected. The current situation has been described as a crisis of human dignity. Okay, so this, I have to remind you, this is from 2009. There's another UN report on the Israel Gaza conflict from 2014. And then there's one that amnesty international just released in April of 2023 and it's finding for from an investigation as they did from 2022 and 2023. Yeah, huge, huge war crimes. So maybe keep talking at your ass or maybe read some stuff that might help you understand the actual situation. Okay, have a good night. It's okay. It's hard to accept sometimes that what we've been told or what we haven't been told the way that thinks it been portrayed to us is propaganda and it's a lie. It's okay to admit you're wrong. That's cruel and that's what we're supposed to do here as human beings. At least that's what I think anyway. Have a day you deserve. And as always, free Palestine. Uncolonize the world. And this is the first page of the goldstone and where I was reading from, I actually had a stick in two binders because there's so much. I didn't have a big enough binder but this was the section that I read from to you tonight. Thank you. Thank you.",subjective

That's why I repost. I mean, just in the last couple of days, I have reposted all of these videos with the intention of educating, informing and amplifying voices. And you may have noticed, maybe you haven't noticed, but I'm also posting significantly less because I want to hold space for those videos, because I think they are much more important than anything I could put out there in the world right now. But I am still posting some stuff, and I'm doing that more for my own self-care, because I still want to feel some sense of normality and some lightness amongst all of the dark that we are experiencing. And I am fully aware of how far it is that I have the privilege to do that where other people cannot fully aware of that fucking privilege. But the reason I'm making this video, I'll get to the point, sorry, I'm rambling, I'm tired, is that I wanted to share some of the things that I have done that maybe you could do too, and they're really simple things to do that can make a positive impact on the world, even though we are just one person amongst the world. So one of the things you can do is play with this filter, because the creator of this filter is in the creator fund, and if you use this filter, and if they get over 200,000 uses, they can use the funds from this, they plan on donating that to humanitarian aid, which I think is fantastic, and this costs everyone nothing. We could all do this. So there is also boycotts that I think will send a really clear message. So that is McDonald's Disney and Starbucks, they're the big three. I think I shared, I think I reposted the video where we explained it. We don't have Starbucks here, so that's an easy one for me. But also McDonald's and cancelling our Disney subscription. We're doing stand instead at the moment, so it's fine. You still get to be in the comfort of your home with your streaming services, just different streaming services, and you can still do that while not losing any of your privilege. The last one you can do, which is, can do on your phone right now, go to apanapan.org.au That is the Australian Palestinian Action Network, I think I've done that right. Anyway, if you go to their website, they have a form where you can put in your postcode and it will tell you who your local MP is, and they have an email ready to go. You don't have to write it. You can just put in your postcode to get your local MP, and they pre-write that for you, and then you just press send. You can do that. Sorry, there's some things you can do. Have a great night.

Palestinian declares independence. Palestinian, Palestine declares independence. 1993, Israel and the PLO signed the Declaration of Principles of Intern Self-Government Arrangements, also known as the Oslo Records, and several permanent status of these things. 1995, Israel and the PLO signed the Palestinian Israeli Agreement on the West Bank in Gaza Strip. 2006, in January, Hamas, a different political party that was way more extreme than the PLO, because as time went on, the PLO became less violent, and they started to try and get along with Israel. And Hamas came in in 2006, and wins the Palestinian legislative elections, and forms the Palestinian authority government. And this is what kind of starts, what is happening today in 2023. In July, Israel goes to war with, um, Hezbollah and Lebanon. So in 2006, they declared war. 2007, Israel imposes a blockade on the Gaza Strip after an arm takeover of Gaza and after an arm takeover of Gaza by Hamas. In November, the Anna Police Conference ends with parties issuing a joint statement, committing to immediately implement their respective obligations under the roadmap, and working towards a peace treaty by the end of 2008. 2008, reminder, this is the year that Israel and Hamas controlled Palestine, or spoke to be working towards peace. 2008, Israel broadens its satience and completely seals off the Gaza Strip. Later in that year, Israel launches Operation Cast Lead, a massive 22-day military assault on the Gaza Strip. Reminder, 2008, they're supposed to be working towards peace. 2009, Security Council passes resolution 1860, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. HRC creates the UN Fact Finding Mission on Gaza conflict to investigate violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. Findings are in the Goldstone Report. The Goldstone Report, I read it. I read the whole thing and I also watched the video where they discuss it. And oh my god, it is interesting. And this is, I might put this in the next part because the Goldstone Report is huge and it is a very telling of how what is happening now in 2023 is consistent with Israel's past actions by not listening to the UN and committing human rights violations and",subjective

When hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were violently displaced from their homeland, in order to create the state of Israel. By the end of 1947, Zionists had several well-developed paramilitary forces, the largest one known as the Haganat, and more extremist militias like Irgun. On March 10th, a couple of months before the British mandate would end, the Haganat adopted what was called Plan-Dollett, or Plan-D. On paper, the main goal was to gain control of the Jewish state as laid out in the partition plan, while also defending Jewish settlements outside of the borders. In reality, that's where the majority of these operations took place, outside of the UN's proposed Jewish state, some carried out by Haganat and others by more radical militias. Many of these operations focused on isolating Jerusalem and the roads to it. A set of brutal instructions called for the destruction of Arab villages by setting fire to, blowing up, and planting mines, especially those population centers which were difficult to control. In case of resistance, it called for the population to be expelled outside of the borders of the state, villages emptied, and for the occupation and control of Arab villages along main transportation arteries. After taking derriacine, Zionist paramilitary groups cleared a major cities, including Haifa and Jaffa, and took hundreds of smaller villages and towns too. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced to flee, pouring into neighboring states as refugees. Plan-D became the blueprint for carrying out the ethnic cleansing of historic Palestine to make room for a new state. And on May 14th, the day before the British mandate ended, Zionist declared the state as Israel. Over time, the state of Israel covered up the physical evidence of an Arab Palestine. Place names were often changed from Arabic ones to Hebrew ones. The Jewish National Fund embarked on a massive effort to plant thousands of acres of pine forests and recreational areas, on top of hundreds of ruined Palestinian villages. While we know that roughly 6,000 Israelis lost their lives in the violence of the Nakba, records for Palestinian deaths weren't kept. It's estimated to be around 15,000 by the end of the Nakba, roughly 750,000 Palestinians had been forcefully expelled, and more than 500 villages destroyed. Though the UN's partition plan allotted Israel 56% of the land, through the Nakba, Israel captured 78% of the land. It was everything except what's now known as the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Today, that's up to at least 85% of the total area, turning 6 million Palestinians into refugees without a homeland. It's why, around the same time that Israelis are celebrating Independence Day, Palestinians are out protesting on May 15th, holding up keys as a symbol of the homes they lost and the hope to return.",subjective

Give the answers no, stick around and I'll tell you exactly what to do. Hey guys my name is Adam and this is Joe and this is Hagan a training gun, self defense to the chest. Now before we get started with the technique guys, couple of things to consider. Number one, understand what the goal is. The goal is not to be a hero, the goal is safety. So that safety might be achieved not through self defense but through negotiation and giving up whatever they're demanding of you. So here's what I mean. If the person is demanding your wallet, your watch, your keys, then that's what you do to achieve your safety. However, if you find yourself in a situation where that's not going to do the trick and you feel the person is going to hurt you with this gun or somebody around you, then you're forced to act and here's the technique that we're going to use. Okay here we go. So step number one, we have to consider distance. A, the gun is too far away and out of reach, we are not going to attempt a dish on because the gun, the bullet is going to be faster than your reaction and your hands. So the idea is to be close to enough where we can attempt or we can grab the gun. We're going to de-escalate the situation by bringing our hands up and it varies the mis-ipotent of the way Joe was doing right now. And we're going to use a little verbal de-escalation by saying, pay man, whatever you want, putting the person at ease. When we're ready to spring into action, we are going to remove ourselves from the land of fire where they quick action, blading our body, pulling your right hand back to your chest. This is going to induce a reaction for me, the individual with the gun. I'm going to try and take the gun back and I'm going to pull him and effectively into my body. Notice his elbow is locked. If I attempt to pull the light of fire or the gun back in his direction, it's impossible. Step number two, he's going to be trope the top and he's going to start striking to loosen and get my attention away from this battle and now I'm paying attention to the punches coming at my face. Next, he's going to reach underneath the gun, grab the back corner, twist, rotate the gun, breaking my finger and causing my hands to open. He's going to take the gun, seed it in, he's down at a hand, he's going to rack the weapon to clear any jams, charge it and put it on me my chin, put some into positions and now start negotiating his safety and the ones around him. So if you enjoyed this content and you're interested in more like this, click and follow us guys and we'll be putting some more content on gun and also on knife. This is Adam, that's Joe, this is Hagen and Training and we'll catch you guys on the next video. Bye bye.",subjective

Also, he served as the chief of staff in the IDF during the Swiss War in 1956, and went on to serve as chief of defence staff in the 6th day war in 1967. This picture of Moshedayan became the symbol of Israeli aggression against the Palestinians around the world, particularly after the 6th day war in 1967. Moshedayan joined the Haganah in the late 1920s, and went on to serve in the special night forces under the Winkids, and went on to fight during the Arab Revolt against Israeli occupation in British-Manded Palestine, and even went on to lose an eye as you can see right there during the Arab uprising in British occupied or British-Manded Palestine. Moshedayan was very close to the founder of modernist state of Israel, David Ben-Gurion, and by 1965 he had joined the Rafi political party led by Shimon Perez, was fell out of favor and was later expelled from the party and joined the Kembergai in later on in the Likut.

When hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were violently displaced from their homeland, in order to create the state of Israel. By the end of 1947, Zionists had several well-developed paramilitary forces, the largest one known as the Haganat, and more extremist militias like Irgun. On March 10th, a couple of months before the British mandate would end, the Haganat adopted what was called Plan-Dollett, or Plan-D. On paper, the main goal was to gain control of the Jewish state as laid out in the partition plan, while also defending Jewish settlements outside of the borders. In reality, that's where the majority of these operations took place, outside of the UN's proposed Jewish state, some carried out by Haganat and others by more radical militias. Many of these operations focused on isolating Jerusalem and the roads to it. A set of brutal instructions called for the destruction of Arab villages by setting fire to, blowing up, and planting mines, especially those population centers which were difficult to control. In case of resistance, it called for the population to be expelled outside of the borders of the state, villages emptied, and for the occupation and control of Arab villages along main transportation arteries. After taking derriacine, Zionist paramilitary groups cleared a major cities, including Haifa and Jaffa, and took hundreds of smaller villages and towns too. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced to flee, pouring into neighboring states as refugees. Plan-D became the blueprint for carrying out the ethnic cleansing of historic Palestine to make room for a new state. And on May 14th, the day before the British mandate ended, Zionist declared the state as Israel. Over time, the state of Israel covered up the physical evidence of an Arab Palestine. Place names were often changed from Arabic ones to Hebrew ones. The Jewish National Fund embarked on a massive effort to plant thousands of acres of pine forests and recreational areas, on top of hundreds of ruined Palestinian villages. While we know that roughly 6,000 Israelis lost their lives in the violence of the Nakba, records for Palestinian deaths weren't kept. It's estimated to be around 15,000 by the end of the Nakba, roughly 750,000 Palestinians had been forcefully expelled, and more than 500 villages destroyed. Though the UN's partition plan allotted Israel 56% of the land, through the Nakba, Israel captured 78% of the land. It was everything except what's now known as the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Today, that's up to at least 85% of the total area, turning 6 million Palestinians into refugees without a homeland. It's why, around the same time that Israelis are celebrating Independence Day, Palestinians are out protesting on May 15th, holding up keys as a symbol of the homes they lost and the hope to return.",subjective

Now before we get started with the technique guys, couple of things to consider. Number one, understand what the goal is. The goal is not to be a hero, the goal is safety. So that safety might be achieved not through self defense but through negotiation and giving up whatever they're demanding of you. So here's what I mean. If the person is demanding your wallet, your watch, your keys, then that's what you do to achieve your safety.

A, the gun is too far away and out of reach, we are not going to attempt a dish on because the gun, the bullet is going to be faster than your reaction and your hands.

When we're ready to spring into action, we are going to remove ourselves from the land of fire where they quick action, blading our body, pulling your right hand back to your chest. This is going to induce a reaction for me, the individual with the gun. I'm going to try and take the gun back and I'm going to pull him and effectively into my body. Notice his elbow is locked. If I attempt to pull the light of fire or the gun back in his direction, it's impossible. Step number two, he's going to be trope the top and he's going to start striking to loosen and get my attention away from this battle and now I'm paying attention to the punches coming at my face. Next, he's going to reach underneath the gun, grab the back corner, twist, rotate the gun, breaking my finger and causing my hands to open.

When hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were violently displaced from their homeland, in order to create the state of Israel. By the end of 1947, Zionists had several well-developed paramilitary forces, the largest one known as the Haganat, and more extremist militias like Irgun. On March 10th, a couple of months before the British mandate would end, the Haganat adopted what was called Plan-Dollett, or Plan-D. On paper, the main goal was to gain control of the Jewish state as laid out in the partition plan, while also defending Jewish settlements outside of the borders. In reality, that's where the majority of these operations took place, outside of the UN's proposed Jewish state, some carried out by Haganat and others by more radical militias. Many of these operations focused on isolating Jerusalem and the roads to it. A set of brutal instructions called for the destruction of Arab villages by setting fire to, blowing up, and planting mines, especially those population centers which were difficult to control. In case of resistance, it called for the population to be expelled outside of the borders of the state, villages emptied, and for the occupation and control of Arab villages along main transportation arteries. After taking derriacine, Zionist paramilitary groups cleared a major cities, including Haifa and Jaffa, and took hundreds of smaller villages and towns too. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced to flee, pouring into neighboring states as refugees. Plan-D became the blueprint for carrying out the ethnic cleansing of historic Palestine to make room for a new state. And on May 14th, the day before the British mandate ended, Zionist declared the state as Israel. Over time, the state of Israel covered up the physical evidence of an Arab Palestine. Place names were often changed from Arabic ones to Hebrew ones. The Jewish National Fund embarked on a massive effort to plant thousands of acres of pine forests and recreational areas, on top of hundreds of ruined Palestinian villages. While we know that roughly 6,000 Israelis lost their lives in the violence of the Nakba, records for Palestinian deaths weren't kept. It's estimated to be around 15,000 by the end of the Nakba, roughly 750,000 Palestinians had been forcefully expelled, and more than 500 villages destroyed. Though the UN's partition plan allotted Israel 56% of the land, through the Nakba, Israel captured 78% of the land. It was everything except what's now known as the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Today, that's up to at least 85% of the total area, turning 6 million Palestinians into refugees without a homeland. It's why, around the same time that Israelis are celebrating Independence Day, Palestinians are out protesting on May 15th, holding up keys as a symbol of the homes they lost and the hope to return.",subjective

Give the answers no, stick around and I'll tell you exactly what to do. Hey guys my name is Adam and this is Joe and this is Hagan a training gun, self defense to the chest. Now before we get started with the technique guys, couple of things to consider. Number one, understand what the goal is. The goal is not to be a hero, the goal is safety. So that safety might be achieved not through self defense but through negotiation and giving up whatever they're demanding of you. So here's what I mean. If the person is demanding your wallet, your watch, your keys, then that's what you do to achieve your safety. However, if you find yourself in a situation where that's not going to do the trick and you feel the person is going to hurt you with this gun or somebody around you, then you're forced to act and here's the technique that we're going to use. Okay here we go. So step number one, we have to consider distance. A, the gun is too far away and out of reach, we are not going to attempt a dish on because the gun, the bullet is going to be faster than your reaction and your hands. So the idea is to be close to enough where we can attempt or we can grab the gun. We're going to de-escalate the situation by bringing our hands up and it varies the mis-ipotent of the way Joe was doing right now. And we're going to use a little verbal de-escalation by saying, pay man, whatever you want, putting the person at ease. When we're ready to spring into action, we are going to remove ourselves from the land of fire where they quick action, blading our body, pulling your right hand back to your chest. This is going to induce a reaction for me, the individual with the gun. I'm going to try and take the gun back and I'm going to pull him and effectively into my body. Notice his elbow is locked. If I attempt to pull the light of fire or the gun back in his direction, it's impossible. Step number two, he's going to be trope the top and he's going to start striking to loosen and get my attention away from this battle and now I'm paying attention to the punches coming at my face. Next, he's going to reach underneath the gun, grab the back corner, twist, rotate the gun, breaking my finger and causing my hands to open. He's going to take the gun, seed it in, he's down at a hand, he's going to rack the weapon to clear any jams, charge it and put it on me my chin, put some into positions and now start negotiating his safety and the ones around him. So if you enjoyed this content and you're interested in more like this, click and follow us guys and we'll be putting some more content on gun and also on knife. This is Adam, that's Joe, this is Hagen and Training and we'll catch you guys on the next video. Bye bye.",subjective

Also, he served as the chief of staff in the IDF during the Swiss War in 1956, and went on to serve as chief of defence staff in the 6th day war in 1967. This picture of Moshedayan became the symbol of Israeli aggression against the Palestinians around the world, particularly after the 6th day war in 1967. Moshedayan joined the Haganah in the late 1920s, and went on to serve in the special night forces under the Winkids, and went on to fight during the Arab Revolt against Israeli occupation in British-Manded Palestine, and even went on to lose an eye as you can see right there during the Arab uprising in British occupied or British-Manded Palestine. Moshedayan was very close to the founder of modernist state of Israel, David Ben-Gurion, and by 1965 he had joined the Rafi political party led by Shimon Perez, was fell out of favor and was later expelled from the party and joined the Kembergai in later on in the Likut.

I wanted to make another video today. This one is going to be on the UNRWA or the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. This agency was established by the United Nations in 1949 after the creation of the State of Israel. It's intended purpose is and was to help Palestinians that have been displaced due to the actions of the State of Israel. It's sort of hard to quantify all of the things that the UNRWA does. They have around 30,000 staff members and they provide education, health services, human resources like food and water. They run refugee camps. They just provide a lot of relief for Palestinians that live both in the West Bank and Gaza and in the diaspora. You can see here off of the UNRWA website that 3 million people regularly use the health services that are provided by the UNRWA. The reason that I'm making this video is that shortly after the ICJ issued its preliminary decision saying that the charge of genocide against Israel was quote unquote plausible. The State of Israel seemed to seek some retribution and the retribution that they sought was classifying the UNRWA as a terrorist organization. They said that 7 of the UNRWA employees were participants in the October 7th attacks. I think it's extremely important to point out that Israel provided literally zero documentation, zero evidence to back up these claims that they were making against the UNRWA. As a result of these allegations, countries like the US, the UK, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Finland, Switzerland, Canada and Australia, all simultaneously paused or pulled their funding for the UNRWA. This organization relies heavily on these voluntary donations by these countries and the UNRWA has come out and said they are not sure if they're going to be able to continue providing services through the end of this year. I know that the US and the UK alone provide around $600 million a year in funding. So by them cutting funding, this is a gigantic financial hit to the organization. Given what's going on and continues to go on in both Gaza and the West Bank, this organization's services are needed now perhaps more than ever. Fortunately, if you go to UNRWA.org, you can access their website. You can learn more about the organization, what services they provide, where they operate, etc. And you can also donate through this website. So I encourage every single one of you to go take a look at their website. If you can, please consider donating to the organization because they are in dire need of these funds in order to keep these services operational and going. If you are not in a position to donate, that's totally fine. I understand. If you could like, share and comment on this video just to push the message app as far as possible. And I also encourage you to do your own research. Make your own videos. Keep the conversation going so hopefully we can assist in keeping this vital organization intact and providing services to those who need it. I thank you all so much for watching and listening.

So time for another debunked, seven Israeli myths about UNRWA. Myth number one, UNRWA is only for Palestinians. What about Jewish refugees? Well, actually UNRWA was established in 1949 by the UN General Assembly, and Israel was one of the countries that voted in favor of it. In fact, in the wake of what Israel calls its war of independence and what Palestinians call the NACPA, and for the first two full years of its existence, UNRWA also provided relief to Jewish refugees from that conflict up until 1952, when the Israelis decided they would take over that mission. And in 1967, it was the Israelis who occupied the West Bank and Gaza, and then insisted UNRWA stick around to look after the local Palestinian population. Myth number two, you don't need UNRWA. You could just have the UNHCR, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which takes care of all the other refugees in the world. It could take care of Palestinian refugees too. Nope, not true. UNRWA was set up in 1949, and its mandate to deal specifically with 1948 refugees from Palestine comes from the UN General Assembly. The UNHCR was set up a year later in 1950, and its mandate comes from the refugee convention, which explicitly said it didn't apply to refugees already receiving assistance from other UN agencies. Also, the UNHCR doesn't do direct services the way UNRWA does. Myth number three, UNRWA, unlike other refugee agencies, allows the descendants of Palestinian refugees to claim refugee status too, and thereby inflates and perpetuates the refugee problem. Sorry what? And the international law, the children of refugees are also refugees. That's not a Palestinian thing, that's an Afghan thing, that's a Somali thing, that's a Tibetan thing. In fact, UNRWA, unlike the UNHCR, says that only fathers, not mothers, can transfer refugee status to their descendants. thereby excluding a significant amount of Palestinians across the world who would otherwise be able to claim refugee status. Myth number four, UNRWA textbooks teach anti-Semitic hate to Palestinian kids. Not true. In fact, a Trump State Department report found that 97% of those textbooks contain no anti-Semitic or even anti-Israel bias. 3% is still bad, I know, but it's a tiny minority. Myth number five, UNRWA is in cooots with Hamas in Gaza. Actually, Hamas doesn't really like UNRWA, never has. Here's a story from 10 years ago about Hamas being peeved at UNRWA because it was too western, not in line with conservative Islamic values and a bit of a competitor with Hamas in terms of providing social services to Gaza's population. In fact, Hamas has been accused of threatening and even trying to assassinate UNRWA staff. Myth number six, 12 UNRWA employees were involved in the October 7th, Hamas attacks on Israel. First off, even if there were 12 UNRWA employees who participated in that barbarism, that's 12 out of 13,000 UNRWA employees in Gaza, less than 0.01% of the total, and yet the US agreed to halt vital humanitarian aid for millions of Palestinians via UNRWA because of that alleged 0.01%. Second, we don't even know if 12 employees were involved. Israel is often no hard evidence. Despite Secretary Blinken claiming Israel's claims on this were highly credible, an internal US intelligence report says it has low confidence that UNRWA staffers were part of the attack and says Israel has not shared the raw intelligence behind its assessments. And last week, UNRWA said in an internal report that some of their employees were tortured by the Israelis into making false claims about UNRWA staff as taking part on October 7th. But that report from UNRWA hasn't had as much coverage as the initial Israeli claims about UNRWA. You'll be shocked to hear. And finally, Myth number seven, there is no Israeli plan to deliberately destroy UNRWA. That's just a Palestinian conspiracy theory. Oh really, a Palestinian conspiracy theory, you say. Meet Noga Arbal, a former Israeli foreign ministry official. Here she is testifying in front of the Israeli parliament in January. In fact, this week we learn that Israeli military is bent on dismantling on eliminating UNRWA. So forget the lies, the myth, the propaganda. This is an Israeli war on UNRWA and by extension on the starving people of Gaza. Why on earth is the United States joining in?",subjective

I wanted to make another video today. This one is going to be on the UNRWA or the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. This agency was established by the United Nations in 1949 after the creation of the State of Israel. It's intended purpose is and was to help Palestinians that have been displaced due to the actions of the State of Israel. It's sort of hard to quantify all of the things that the UNRWA does. They have around 30,000 staff members and they provide education, health services, human resources like food and water. They run refugee camps. They just provide a lot of relief for Palestinians that live both in the West Bank and Gaza and in the diaspora. You can see here off of the UNRWA website that 3 million people regularly use the health services that are provided by the UNRWA. The reason that I'm making this video is that shortly after the ICJ issued its preliminary decision saying that the charge of genocide against Israel was quote unquote plausible. The State of Israel seemed to seek some retribution and the retribution that they sought was classifying the UNRWA as a terrorist organization. They said that 7 of the UNRWA employees were participants in the October 7th attacks. I think it's extremely important to point out that Israel provided literally zero documentation, zero evidence to back up these claims that they were making against the UNRWA. As a result of these allegations, countries like the US, the UK, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Finland, Switzerland, Canada and Australia, all simultaneously paused or pulled their funding for the UNRWA. This organization relies heavily on these voluntary donations by these countries and the UNRWA has come out and said they are not sure if they're going to be able to continue providing services through the end of this year. I know that the US and the UK alone provide around $600 million a year in funding. So by them cutting funding, this is a gigantic financial hit to the organization. Given what's going on and continues to go on in both Gaza and the West Bank, this organization's services are needed now perhaps more than ever. Fortunately, if you go to UNRWA.org, you can access their website. You can learn more about the organization, what services they provide, where they operate, etc. And you can also donate through this website. So I encourage every single one of you to go take a look at their website. If you can, please consider donating to the organization because they are in dire need of these funds in order to keep these services operational and going. If you are not in a position to donate, that's totally fine. I understand. If you could like, share and comment on this video just to push the message app as far as possible. And I also encourage you to do your own research. Make your own videos. Keep the conversation going so hopefully we can assist in keeping this vital organization intact and providing services to those who need it. I thank you all so much for watching and listening.

So time for another debunked, seven Israeli myths about UNRWA. Myth number one, UNRWA is only for Palestinians. What about Jewish refugees? Well, actually UNRWA was established in 1949 by the UN General Assembly, and Israel was one of the countries that voted in favor of it. In fact, in the wake of what Israel calls its war of independence and what Palestinians call the NACPA, and for the first two full years of its existence, UNRWA also provided relief to Jewish refugees from that conflict up until 1952, when the Israelis decided they would take over that mission. And in 1967, it was the Israelis who occupied the West Bank and Gaza, and then insisted UNRWA stick around to look after the local Palestinian population. Myth number two, you don't need UNRWA. You could just have the UNHCR, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which takes care of all the other refugees in the world. It could take care of Palestinian refugees too. Nope, not true. UNRWA was set up in 1949, and its mandate to deal specifically with 1948 refugees from Palestine comes from the UN General Assembly. The UNHCR was set up a year later in 1950, and its mandate comes from the refugee convention, which explicitly said it didn't apply to refugees already receiving assistance from other UN agencies. Also, the UNHCR doesn't do direct services the way UNRWA does. Myth number three, UNRWA, unlike other refugee agencies, allows the descendants of Palestinian refugees to claim refugee status too, and thereby inflates and perpetuates the refugee problem. Sorry what? And the international law, the children of refugees are also refugees. That's not a Palestinian thing, that's an Afghan thing, that's a Somali thing, that's a Tibetan thing. In fact, UNRWA, unlike the UNHCR, says that only fathers, not mothers, can transfer refugee status to their descendants. thereby excluding a significant amount of Palestinians across the world who would otherwise be able to claim refugee status. Myth number four, UNRWA textbooks teach anti-Semitic hate to Palestinian kids. Not true. In fact, a Trump State Department report found that 97% of those textbooks contain no anti-Semitic or even anti-Israel bias. 3% is still bad, I know, but it's a tiny minority. Myth number five, UNRWA is in cooots with Hamas in Gaza. Actually, Hamas doesn't really like UNRWA, never has. Here's a story from 10 years ago about Hamas being peeved at UNRWA because it was too western, not in line with conservative Islamic values and a bit of a competitor with Hamas in terms of providing social services to Gaza's population. In fact, Hamas has been accused of threatening and even trying to assassinate UNRWA staff. Myth number six, 12 UNRWA employees were involved in the October 7th, Hamas attacks on Israel. First off, even if there were 12 UNRWA employees who participated in that barbarism, that's 12 out of 13,000 UNRWA employees in Gaza, less than 0.01% of the total, and yet the US agreed to halt vital humanitarian aid for millions of Palestinians via UNRWA because of that alleged 0.01%. Second, we don't even know if 12 employees were involved. Israel is often no hard evidence. Despite Secretary Blinken claiming Israel's claims on this were highly credible, an internal US intelligence report says it has low confidence that UNRWA staffers were part of the attack and says Israel has not shared the raw intelligence behind its assessments. And last week, UNRWA said in an internal report that some of their employees were tortured by the Israelis into making false claims about UNRWA staff as taking part on October 7th. But that report from UNRWA hasn't had as much coverage as the initial Israeli claims about UNRWA. You'll be shocked to hear. And finally, Myth number seven, there is no Israeli plan to deliberately destroy UNRWA. That's just a Palestinian conspiracy theory. Oh really, a Palestinian conspiracy theory, you say. Meet Noga Arbal, a former Israeli foreign ministry official. Here she is testifying in front of the Israeli parliament in January. In fact, this week we learn that Israeli military is bent on dismantling on eliminating UNRWA. So forget the lies, the myth, the propaganda. This is an Israeli war on UNRWA and by extension on the starving people of Gaza. Why on earth is the United States joining in?",subjective

I wanted to make another video today. This one is going to be on the UNRWA or the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. This agency was established by the United Nations in 1949 after the creation of the State of Israel. It's intended purpose is and was to help Palestinians that have been displaced due to the actions of the State of Israel. It's sort of hard to quantify all of the things that the UNRWA does. They have around 30,000 staff members and they provide education, health services, human resources like food and water. They run refugee camps. They just provide a lot of relief for Palestinians that live both in the West Bank and Gaza and in the diaspora. You can see here off of the UNRWA website that 3 million people regularly use the health services that are provided by the UNRWA. The reason that I'm making this video is that shortly after the ICJ issued its preliminary decision saying that the charge of genocide against Israel was quote unquote plausible. The State of Israel seemed to seek some retribution and the retribution that they sought was classifying the UNRWA as a terrorist organization. They said that 7 of the UNRWA employees were participants in the October 7th attacks. I think it's extremely important to point out that Israel provided literally zero documentation, zero evidence to back up these claims that they were making against the UNRWA. As a result of these allegations, countries like the US, the UK, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Finland, Switzerland, Canada and Australia, all simultaneously paused or pulled their funding for the UNRWA. This organization relies heavily on these voluntary donations by these countries and the UNRWA has come out and said they are not sure if they're going to be able to continue providing services through the end of this year. I know that the US and the UK alone provide around $600 million a year in funding. So by them cutting funding, this is a gigantic financial hit to the organization. Given what's going on and continues to go on in both Gaza and the West Bank, this organization's services are needed now perhaps more than ever. Fortunately, if you go to UNRWA.org, you can access their website. You can learn more about the organization, what services they provide, where they operate, etc. And you can also donate through this website. So I encourage every single one of you to go take a look at their website. If you can, please consider donating to the organization because they are in dire need of these funds in order to keep these services operational and going. If you are not in a position to donate, that's totally fine. I understand. If you could like, share and comment on this video just to push the message app as far as possible. And I also encourage you to do your own research. Make your own videos. Keep the conversation going so hopefully we can assist in keeping this vital organization intact and providing services to those who need it. I thank you all so much for watching and listening.

So time for another debunked, seven Israeli myths about UNRWA. Myth number one, UNRWA is only for Palestinians. What about Jewish refugees? Well, actually UNRWA was established in 1949 by the UN General Assembly, and Israel was one of the countries that voted in favor of it. In fact, in the wake of what Israel calls its war of independence and what Palestinians call the NACPA, and for the first two full years of its existence, UNRWA also provided relief to Jewish refugees from that conflict up until 1952, when the Israelis decided they would take over that mission. And in 1967, it was the Israelis who occupied the West Bank and Gaza, and then insisted UNRWA stick around to look after the local Palestinian population. Myth number two, you don't need UNRWA. You could just have the UNHCR, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which takes care of all the other refugees in the world. It could take care of Palestinian refugees too. Nope, not true. UNRWA was set up in 1949, and its mandate to deal specifically with 1948 refugees from Palestine comes from the UN General Assembly. The UNHCR was set up a year later in 1950, and its mandate comes from the refugee convention, which explicitly said it didn't apply to refugees already receiving assistance from other UN agencies. Also, the UNHCR doesn't do direct services the way UNRWA does. Myth number three, UNRWA, unlike other refugee agencies, allows the descendants of Palestinian refugees to claim refugee status too, and thereby inflates and perpetuates the refugee problem. Sorry what? And the international law, the children of refugees are also refugees. That's not a Palestinian thing, that's an Afghan thing, that's a Somali thing, that's a Tibetan thing. In fact, UNRWA, unlike the UNHCR, says that only fathers, not mothers, can transfer refugee status to their descendants. thereby excluding a significant amount of Palestinians across the world who would otherwise be able to claim refugee status. Myth number four, UNRWA textbooks teach anti-Semitic hate to Palestinian kids. Not true. In fact, a Trump State Department report found that 97% of those textbooks contain no anti-Semitic or even anti-Israel bias. 3% is still bad, I know, but it's a tiny minority. Myth number five, UNRWA is in cooots with Hamas in Gaza. Actually, Hamas doesn't really like UNRWA, never has. Here's a story from 10 years ago about Hamas being peeved at UNRWA because it was too western, not in line with conservative Islamic values and a bit of a competitor with Hamas in terms of providing social services to Gaza's population. In fact, Hamas has been accused of threatening and even trying to assassinate UNRWA staff. Myth number six, 12 UNRWA employees were involved in the October 7th, Hamas attacks on Israel. First off, even if there were 12 UNRWA employees who participated in that barbarism, that's 12 out of 13,000 UNRWA employees in Gaza, less than 0.01% of the total, and yet the US agreed to halt vital humanitarian aid for millions of Palestinians via UNRWA because of that alleged 0.01%. Second, we don't even know if 12 employees were involved. Israel is often no hard evidence. Despite Secretary Blinken claiming Israel's claims on this were highly credible, an internal US intelligence report says it has low confidence that UNRWA staffers were part of the attack and says Israel has not shared the raw intelligence behind its assessments. And last week, UNRWA said in an internal report that some of their employees were tortured by the Israelis into making false claims about UNRWA staff as taking part on October 7th. But that report from UNRWA hasn't had as much coverage as the initial Israeli claims about UNRWA. You'll be shocked to hear. And finally, Myth number seven, there is no Israeli plan to deliberately destroy UNRWA. That's just a Palestinian conspiracy theory. Oh really, a Palestinian conspiracy theory, you say. Meet Noga Arbal, a former Israeli foreign ministry official. Here she is testifying in front of the Israeli parliament in January. In fact, this week we learn that Israeli military is bent on dismantling on eliminating UNRWA. So forget the lies, the myth, the propaganda. This is an Israeli war on UNRWA and by extension on the starving people of Gaza. Why on earth is the United States joining in?",subjective

I wanted to make another video today. This one is going to be on the UNRWA or the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. This agency was established by the United Nations in 1949 after the creation of the State of Israel. It's intended purpose is and was to help Palestinians that have been displaced due to the actions of the State of Israel. It's sort of hard to quantify all of the things that the UNRWA does. They have around 30,000 staff members and they provide education, health services, human resources like food and water. They run refugee camps. They just provide a lot of relief for Palestinians that live both in the West Bank and Gaza and in the diaspora. You can see here off of the UNRWA website that 3 million people regularly use the health services that are provided by the UNRWA. The reason that I'm making this video is that shortly after the ICJ issued its preliminary decision saying that the charge of genocide against Israel was quote unquote plausible. The State of Israel seemed to seek some retribution and the retribution that they sought was classifying the UNRWA as a terrorist organization. They said that 7 of the UNRWA employees were participants in the October 7th attacks. I think it's extremely important to point out that Israel provided literally zero documentation, zero evidence to back up these claims that they were making against the UNRWA. As a result of these allegations, countries like the US, the UK, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Finland, Switzerland, Canada and Australia, all simultaneously paused or pulled their funding for the UNRWA. This organization relies heavily on these voluntary donations by these countries and the UNRWA has come out and said they are not sure if they're going to be able to continue providing services through the end of this year. I know that the US and the UK alone provide around $600 million a year in funding. So by them cutting funding, this is a gigantic financial hit to the organization. Given what's going on and continues to go on in both Gaza and the West Bank, this organization's services are needed now perhaps more than ever. Fortunately, if you go to UNRWA.org, you can access their website. You can learn more about the organization, what services they provide, where they operate, etc. And you can also donate through this website. So I encourage every single one of you to go take a look at their website. If you can, please consider donating to the organization because they are in dire need of these funds in order to keep these services operational and going. If you are not in a position to donate, that's totally fine. I understand. If you could like, share and comment on this video just to push the message app as far as possible. And I also encourage you to do your own research. Make your own videos.

So time for another debunked, seven Israeli myths about UNRWA. Myth number one, UNRWA is only for Palestinians. What about Jewish refugees? Well, actually UNRWA was established in 1949 by the UN General Assembly, and Israel was one of the countries that voted in favor of it. In fact, in the wake of what Israel calls its war of independence and what Palestinians call the NACPA, and for the first two full years of its existence, UNRWA also provided relief to Jewish refugees from that conflict up until 1952, when the Israelis decided they would take over that mission. And in 1967, it was the Israelis who occupied the West Bank and Gaza, and then insisted UNRWA stick around to look after the local Palestinian population. Myth number two, you don't need UNRWA. You could just have the UNHCR, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which takes care of all the other refugees in the world. It could take care of Palestinian refugees too. Nope, not true. UNRWA was set up in 1949, and its mandate to deal specifically with 1948 refugees from Palestine comes from the UN General Assembly. The UNHCR was set up a year later in 1950, and its mandate comes from the refugee convention, which explicitly said it didn't apply to refugees already receiving assistance from other UN agencies. Also, the UNHCR doesn't do direct services the way UNRWA does. Myth number three, UNRWA, unlike other refugee agencies, allows the descendants of Palestinian refugees to claim refugee status too, and thereby inflates and perpetuates the refugee problem. Sorry what? And the international law, the children of refugees are also refugees. That's not a Palestinian thing, that's an Afghan thing, that's a Somali thing, that's a Tibetan thing. In fact, UNRWA, unlike the UNHCR, says that only fathers, not mothers, can transfer refugee status to their descendants. thereby excluding a significant amount of Palestinians across the world who would otherwise be able to claim refugee status. Myth number four, UNRWA textbooks teach anti-Semitic hate to Palestinian kids. Not true. In fact, a Trump State Department report found that 97% of those textbooks contain no anti-Semitic or even anti-Israel bias. 3% is still bad, I know, but it's a tiny minority. Myth number five, UNRWA is in cooots with Hamas in Gaza. Actually, Hamas doesn't really like UNRWA, never has. Here's a story from 10 years ago about Hamas being peeved at UNRWA because it was too western, not in line with conservative Islamic values and a bit of a competitor with Hamas in terms of providing social services to Gaza's population. In fact, Hamas has been accused of threatening and even trying to assassinate UNRWA staff. Myth number six, 12 UNRWA employees were involved in the October 7th, Hamas attacks on Israel. First off, even if there were 12 UNRWA employees who participated in that barbarism, that's 12 out of 13,000 UNRWA employees in Gaza, less than 0.01% of the total, and yet the US agreed to halt vital humanitarian aid for millions of Palestinians via UNRWA because of that alleged 0.01%. Second, we don't even know if 12 employees were involved. Israel is often no hard evidence. Despite Secretary Blinken claiming Israel's claims on this were highly credible, an internal US intelligence report says it has low confidence that UNRWA staffers were part of the attack and says Israel has not shared the raw intelligence behind its assessments. And last week, UNRWA said in an internal report that some of their employees were tortured by the Israelis into making false claims about UNRWA staff as taking part on October 7th. But that report from UNRWA hasn't had as much coverage as the initial Israeli claims about UNRWA. You'll be shocked to hear. And finally, Myth number seven, there is no Israeli plan to deliberately destroy UNRWA. That's just a Palestinian conspiracy theory. Oh really, a Palestinian conspiracy theory, you say. Meet Noga Arbal, a former Israeli foreign ministry official. Here she is testifying in front of the Israeli parliament in January. In fact, this week we learn that Israeli military is bent on dismantling on eliminating UNRWA. So forget the lies, the myth, the propaganda. This is an Israeli war on UNRWA and by extension on the starving people of Gaza. Why on earth is the United States joining in?",subjective

I wanted to make another video today. This one is going to be on the UNRWA or the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. This agency was established by the United Nations in 1949 after the creation of the State of Israel. It's intended purpose is and was to help Palestinians that have been displaced due to the actions of the State of Israel. It's sort of hard to quantify all of the things that the UNRWA does. They have around 30,000 staff members and they provide education, health services, human resources like food and water. They run refugee camps. They just provide a lot of relief for Palestinians that live both in the West Bank and Gaza and in the diaspora. You can see here off of the UNRWA website that 3 million people regularly use the health services that are provided by the UNRWA. The reason that I'm making this video is that shortly after the ICJ issued its preliminary decision saying that the charge of genocide against Israel was quote unquote plausible. The State of Israel seemed to seek some retribution and the retribution that they sought was classifying the UNRWA as a terrorist organization. They said that 7 of the UNRWA employees were participants in the October 7th attacks. I think it's extremely important to point out that Israel provided literally zero documentation, zero evidence to back up these claims that they were making against the UNRWA. As a result of these allegations, countries like the US, the UK, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Finland, Switzerland, Canada and Australia, all simultaneously paused or pulled their funding for the UNRWA. This organization relies heavily on these voluntary donations by these countries and the UNRWA has come out and said they are not sure if they're going to be able to continue providing services through the end of this year. I know that the US and the UK alone provide around $600 million a year in funding. So by them cutting funding, this is a gigantic financial hit to the organization. Given what's going on and continues to go on in both Gaza and the West Bank, this organization's services are needed now perhaps more than ever. Fortunately, if you go to UNRWA.org, you can access their website. You can learn more about the organization, what services they provide, where they operate, etc. And you can also donate through this website. So I encourage every single one of you to go take a look at their website. If you can, please consider donating to the organization because they are in dire need of these funds in order to keep these services operational and going. If you are not in a position to donate, that's totally fine. I understand. If you could like, share and comment on this video just to push the message app as far as possible.

We're looking at chapter four of the Hundred Years War on Palestine, which specifically focuses on 1982. Because of American backing for Israel in tolerance of its actions, its supplies of arms and munitions for use against civilians, its coercion of the PLO to leave Beirut and refusal to deal directly with it, and its worthless assurances of protection, the 1982 invasion must be seen as a joint Israel-US military endeavor. Their first war aimed specifically against Palestinians. In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon. In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon, in large part because the Palestine Liberation Organization, the PLO, was housed there. The PLO was created in 1964 by the Arab League in an effort to control Palestinian nationalism while seeming to support them. In 1960, it was based in Jordan, and in 1970, it was driven out and went to Lebanon. Lebanese civil war began in 1975. Major factors for this war include the interference of the French between World War I and World War II, and multiple waves of influxes of Palestinian refugees. Ten weeks since, by the Israeli army, against the Lebanese capital Beirut, was the first war since 1948 to mainly involve Palestinians. During the 10-week siege, 19,000 were killed and 30,000 wounded, mostly civilians. Israel cut off food, water, fuel, electricity, and in addition to its indiscriminate bombardment of all of Beirut, they also attacked multiple refugee camps. In Beirut, there was continuous bombing, shelling of neighborhoods, and car bombs. This blanket bombardment was designed to create terror. And to turn anyone there against the PLO. Now let's get to Reagan. He provided 1.4 billion in military aid to Israel in both 1981 and 1982. Like the Presidents, before him, he made many uncapped promises to the Arab nations. And when he slashed his government, pressured the PLO into leaving, they failed to make any safeguards for the civilians left behind. While the PLO left on the condition that the civilians would be safe, Israel did not keep that promise because there were no formal sanctions in place. And many of the attacks on the refugee camps happened after the fighting was over. Israel didn't do this dirty work itself. It sent the Lebanese front, the LF. This was one of the sides of the Civil War. This was the right wing side. That was backed by Israel. They were armed. They were funded. They were trained and they were sent by Israel to mop up where they Israel knew how much the LF hated Palestinians and how they would treat them. And they massacred many. And because Israel knew this, and because the US funded Israel and supported Israel, that is why the author argues what I started with, which is that it needs to be seen as a joint attack against Palestinians.",subjective

Let's talk about it. So after the 1967 war, the Six Day War, where the Arab countries attacked Israel, the PLO, the Palestinian Liberation Organization, ended up retreating back into Jordan. By the way, the PLO is basically an umbrella organization that kind of encapsulates all the Palestinian guerrilla groups at that time. So Fatah is one of those groups, one of the factions that was led by Yasser Adafat, an Egyptian man, and they basically used Jordan to launch attacks into Israel. And honestly, they had some victories to a point where they gained a lot of credibility, they gained over 20,000 new members, and it got millions from the Gulf states. So this is where it gets a little bit iffy. The PLO got a little Tukaki in Jordan. They patrol the roads in Aman, they impose illegal taxes on the Jordanian people. They even tried to assassinate King Hussein of Jordan. So after all of this chaos, Jordan was not having it after the 1971 civil war. Jordan kicked the PLO out, and the PLO said, where we go? Lebanon. So the PLO continued their terror attacks against Israel from Lebanon this time. The PLO was creating a civil war between the Muslims and the Christians, and the PLO killed off over 100,000 Lebanese Christians and made so many refugees. And the region was fearing an expanded war to a point where Israel and Syria had to actually intervene on the side of the Christians. So in my opinion, even with the illusion of the Oslo Accords, I believe there's no peace with the PLO, there's no peace with Hamas, there's no peace with the PIJ. We have to look at their actions, the history, and the overall corruption that is in these groups. The Palestinian people and the Israeli people deserve to coexist, and they deserve much more than a corrupt group like the PLO.",subjective

They exist another Thing that I'm going to address a lot of people were concerned for me Because they wanted me to take a position of neutrality and this is gotten to a point where if you are trying to hold a position of neutrality You are trying to appease the wrong kind of people and I already said that I was pro-Palestine and You know I'm not going to be neutral on this I from the get go I was supporting Palestine it is just Have just being human you don't want death for anyone that is just a human thing, okay? It's not about a being a neutral nobody wants death, okay? Let's just put that out of the way What I don't understand is people are upset with Palestinian people specifically Hamas Because they're like why was Hamas violent? Israel was violent first. Did you do you see what I mean like you you can't be surprised that violence is being met with violence Every day more and more of the arguments used by the pro-Israeli people Have began to be proven false the whole 40 headed 40 baby thing proven false AI generated images false even this person They kept saying about a woman being raped and all that kind of stuff that has been proven false She is alive and she's in a Palestinian Hospital in Gaza she is alive and she's being taken care of by Palestinian people I mean you even are seeing clips and Articles of CNN reporters Faking and or admitting to lies. I mean even now Old Israeli government officials have begun to admit that they were fighting they were they were providing Resources and financial Like paying Hamas Israel created Hamas this person I said to them Israel created created Hamas and they were like how couldn't they? They did They literally created Hamas to oppose the PLO the Palestinian leftist organization I think that's what the PLO sense were but they wanted to disrupt What Palestine was doing to give them an excuse to unleash genocide to destroy and take the Khazakh strip What happened during World War II nobody is denying is a terrible awful thing Nobody is denying that okay the Genocide of Jewish people during the Holocaust was a terrible and awful thing and Jewish people deserve to have a place where they feel safe Where they can you know if they want a country they deserve to have that I'm not denying that But not at the expense of Committing another genocide against another group of people you can literally Google the images Because like over like the last 70 something years you can see how Israel The Israeli government and the settle their settlers colonizers have progressively taken more and more Palestinian land to the point where there is only this 25 mile long strip of land that remains that is the Khazakh strip and over 2.2 million Palestinian people live there and The thing that drives me nuts about some of these pro-Israeli Comments as they're always like what about the children what about the children? Over half of the population It's under the age of 18 Keep that in mind and this is part of the reason why I will refer I refuse to continue interacting with these kind of people especially ones that are severely cruel if you are Unformed at this point You have the ability to get informed You have like the world at your fingertips you can choose to inform yourself If you're misinformed Check your resources. I mean so many places have been proven wrong That's all I can say but like if you're just cruel like this person They thought I was Palestinian because if you go back and look at their comments, they're like your government as in like the Palestinian government I am not Palestinian. I'm American I'm white like white white And the way they spoke to me because they thought I was Palestinian Just shows how these people treat actual Palestinian people not once Did they refer to the children? To the civilians of Palestine as people Did them refer to them as children as innocent lives or anything like that they refer to them every single time as human meat shields and There's this argument if like Hamas would just give themselves up like They wouldn't have to die like it's not leave that area of a Khazaa it is literally not that hard It is though because there you Israel controls everything That Khazaa has including the exits they have bombed the exits routes. I have watched actual video footage of the Khazaa Egypt exit being bombed Where are these people to go and to say stuff like this is so incredibly insensitive and ignorant and I will not talk with these people anymore I won't do it and people will be upset with me for saying this for being in support of Palestine and At that I want to say that you don't know me You don't know me because if you go through my page I Have been speaking out against things.

We're looking at chapter four of the Hundred Years War on Palestine, which specifically focuses on 1982. Because of American backing for Israel in tolerance of its actions, its supplies of arms and munitions for use against civilians, its coercion of the PLO to leave Beirut and refusal to deal directly with it, and its worthless assurances of protection, the 1982 invasion must be seen as a joint Israel-US military endeavor. Their first war aimed specifically against Palestinians. In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon. In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon, in large part because the Palestine Liberation Organization, the PLO, was housed there. The PLO was created in 1964 by the Arab League in an effort to control Palestinian nationalism while seeming to support them. In 1960, it was based in Jordan, and in 1970, it was driven out and went to Lebanon. Lebanese civil war began in 1975. Major factors for this war include the interference of the French between World War I and World War II, and multiple waves of influxes of Palestinian refugees. Ten weeks since, by the Israeli army, against the Lebanese capital Beirut, was the first war since 1948 to mainly involve Palestinians. During the 10-week siege, 19,000 were killed and 30,000 wounded, mostly civilians. Israel cut off food, water, fuel, electricity, and in addition to its indiscriminate bombardment of all of Beirut, they also attacked multiple refugee camps. In Beirut, there was continuous bombing, shelling of neighborhoods, and car bombs. This blanket bombardment was designed to create terror. And to turn anyone there against the PLO. Now let's get to Reagan. He provided 1.4 billion in military aid to Israel in both 1981 and 1982. Like the Presidents, before him, he made many uncapped promises to the Arab nations. And when he slashed his government, pressured the PLO into leaving, they failed to make any safeguards for the civilians left behind. While the PLO left on the condition that the civilians would be safe, Israel did not keep that promise because there were no formal sanctions in place. And many of the attacks on the refugee camps happened after the fighting was over. Israel didn't do this dirty work itself. It sent the Lebanese front, the LF. This was one of the sides of the Civil War. This was the right wing side. That was backed by Israel. They were armed. They were funded. They were trained and they were sent by Israel to mop up where they Israel knew how much the LF hated Palestinians and how they would treat them. And they massacred many. And because Israel knew this, and because the US funded Israel and supported Israel, that is why the author argues what I started with, which is that it needs to be seen as a joint attack against Palestinians.",subjective

Let's talk about it. So after the 1967 war, the Six Day War, where the Arab countries attacked Israel, the PLO, the Palestinian Liberation Organization, ended up retreating back into Jordan. By the way, the PLO is basically an umbrella organization that kind of encapsulates all the Palestinian guerrilla groups at that time. So Fatah is one of those groups, one of the factions that was led by Yasser Adafat, an Egyptian man, and they basically used Jordan to launch attacks into Israel. And honestly, they had some victories to a point where they gained a lot of credibility, they gained over 20,000 new members, and it got millions from the Gulf states. So this is where it gets a little bit iffy. The PLO got a little Tukaki in Jordan. They patrol the roads in Aman, they impose illegal taxes on the Jordanian people. They even tried to assassinate King Hussein of Jordan. So after all of this chaos, Jordan was not having it after the 1971 civil war. Jordan kicked the PLO out, and the PLO said, where we go? Lebanon. So the PLO continued their terror attacks against Israel from Lebanon this time. The PLO was creating a civil war between the Muslims and the Christians, and the PLO killed off over 100,000 Lebanese Christians and made so many refugees. And the region was fearing an expanded war to a point where Israel and Syria had to actually intervene on the side of the Christians. So in my opinion, even with the illusion of the Oslo Accords, I believe there's no peace with the PLO, there's no peace with Hamas, there's no peace with the PIJ. We have to look at their actions, the history, and the overall corruption that is in these groups. The Palestinian people and the Israeli people deserve to coexist, and they deserve much more than a corrupt group like the PLO.",subjective

They exist another Thing that I'm going to address a lot of people were concerned for me Because they wanted me to take a position of neutrality and this is gotten to a point where if you are trying to hold a position of neutrality You are trying to appease the wrong kind of people and I already said that I was pro-Palestine and You know I'm not going to be neutral on this I from the get go I was supporting Palestine it is just Have just being human you don't want death for anyone that is just a human thing, okay? It's not about a being a neutral nobody wants death, okay? Let's just put that out of the way What I don't understand is people are upset with Palestinian people specifically Hamas Because they're like why was Hamas violent? Israel was violent first. Did you do you see what I mean like you you can't be surprised that violence is being met with violence Every day more and more of the arguments used by the pro-Israeli people Have began to be proven false the whole 40 headed 40 baby thing proven false AI generated images false even this person They kept saying about a woman being raped and all that kind of stuff that has been proven false She is alive and she's in a Palestinian Hospital in Gaza she is alive and she's being taken care of by Palestinian people I mean you even are seeing clips and Articles of CNN reporters Faking and or admitting to lies. I mean even now Old Israeli government officials have begun to admit that they were fighting they were they were providing Resources and financial Like paying Hamas Israel created Hamas this person I said to them Israel created created Hamas and they were like how couldn't they? They did They literally created Hamas to oppose the PLO the Palestinian leftist organization I think that's what the PLO sense were but they wanted to disrupt What Palestine was doing to give them an excuse to unleash genocide to destroy and take the Khazakh strip What happened during World War II nobody is denying is a terrible awful thing Nobody is denying that okay the Genocide of Jewish people during the Holocaust was a terrible and awful thing and Jewish people deserve to have a place where they feel safe Where they can you know if they want a country they deserve to have that I'm not denying that But not at the expense of Committing another genocide against another group of people you can literally Google the images Because like over like the last 70 something years you can see how Israel The Israeli government and the settle their settlers colonizers have progressively taken more and more Palestinian land to the point where there is only this 25 mile long strip of land that remains that is the Khazakh strip and over 2.2 million Palestinian people live there and The thing that drives me nuts about some of these pro-Israeli Comments as they're always like what about the children what about the children? Over half of the population It's under the age of 18 Keep that in mind and this is part of the reason why I will refer I refuse to continue interacting with these kind of people especially ones that are severely cruel if you are Unformed at this point You have the ability to get informed You have like the world at your fingertips you can choose to inform yourself If you're misinformed Check your resources. I mean so many places have been proven wrong That's all I can say but like if you're just cruel like this person They thought I was Palestinian because if you go back and look at their comments, they're like your government as in like the Palestinian government I am not Palestinian. I'm American I'm white like white white And the way they spoke to me because they thought I was Palestinian Just shows how these people treat actual Palestinian people not once Did they refer to the children? To the civilians of Palestine as people Did them refer to them as children as innocent lives or anything like that they refer to them every single time as human meat shields and There's this argument if like Hamas would just give themselves up like They wouldn't have to die like it's not leave that area of a Khazaa it is literally not that hard It is though because there you Israel controls everything That Khazaa has including the exits they have bombed the exits routes. I have watched actual video footage of the Khazaa Egypt exit being bombed Where are these people to go and to say stuff like this is so incredibly insensitive and ignorant and I will not talk with these people anymore I won't do it and people will be upset with me for saying this for being in support of Palestine and At that I want to say that you don't know me You don't know me because if you go through my page I Have been speaking out against things.

We're looking at chapter four of the Hundred Years War on Palestine, which specifically focuses on 1982. Because of American backing for Israel in tolerance of its actions, its supplies of arms and munitions for use against civilians, its coercion of the PLO to leave Beirut and refusal to deal directly with it, and its worthless assurances of protection, the 1982 invasion must be seen as a joint Israel-US military endeavor. Their first war aimed specifically against Palestinians. In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon. In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon, in large part because the Palestine Liberation Organization, the PLO, was housed there. The PLO was created in 1964 by the Arab League in an effort to control Palestinian nationalism while seeming to support them. In 1960, it was based in Jordan, and in 1970, it was driven out and went to Lebanon. Lebanese civil war began in 1975. Major factors for this war include the interference of the French between World War I and World War II, and multiple waves of influxes of Palestinian refugees. Ten weeks since, by the Israeli army, against the Lebanese capital Beirut, was the first war since 1948 to mainly involve Palestinians. During the 10-week siege, 19,000 were killed and 30,000 wounded, mostly civilians. Israel cut off food, water, fuel, electricity, and in addition to its indiscriminate bombardment of all of Beirut, they also attacked multiple refugee camps. In Beirut, there was continuous bombing, shelling of neighborhoods, and car bombs. This blanket bombardment was designed to create terror. And to turn anyone there against the PLO. Now let's get to Reagan. He provided 1.4 billion in military aid to Israel in both 1981 and 1982. Like the Presidents, before him, he made many uncapped promises to the Arab nations. And when he slashed his government, pressured the PLO into leaving, they failed to make any safeguards for the civilians left behind. While the PLO left on the condition that the civilians would be safe, Israel did not keep that promise because there were no formal sanctions in place. And many of the attacks on the refugee camps happened after the fighting was over. Israel didn't do this dirty work itself. It sent the Lebanese front, the LF. This was one of the sides of the Civil War. This was the right wing side. That was backed by Israel. They were armed. They were funded. They were trained and they were sent by Israel to mop up where they Israel knew how much the LF hated Palestinians and how they would treat them. And they massacred many. And because Israel knew this, and because the US funded Israel and supported Israel, that is why the author argues what I started with, which is that it needs to be seen as a joint attack against Palestinians.",subjective

Let's talk about it. So after the 1967 war, the Six Day War, where the Arab countries attacked Israel, the PLO, the Palestinian Liberation Organization, ended up retreating back into Jordan. By the way, the PLO is basically an umbrella organization that kind of encapsulates all the Palestinian guerrilla groups at that time. So Fatah is one of those groups, one of the factions that was led by Yasser Adafat, an Egyptian man, and they basically used Jordan to launch attacks into Israel. And honestly, they had some victories to a point where they gained a lot of credibility, they gained over 20,000 new members, and it got millions from the Gulf states. So this is where it gets a little bit iffy. The PLO got a little Tukaki in Jordan. They patrol the roads in Aman, they impose illegal taxes on the Jordanian people. They even tried to assassinate King Hussein of Jordan. So after all of this chaos, Jordan was not having it after the 1971 civil war. Jordan kicked the PLO out, and the PLO said, where we go? Lebanon. So the PLO continued their terror attacks against Israel from Lebanon this time. The PLO was creating a civil war between the Muslims and the Christians, and the PLO killed off over 100,000 Lebanese Christians and made so many refugees. And the region was fearing an expanded war to a point where Israel and Syria had to actually intervene on the side of the Christians. So in my opinion, even with the illusion of the Oslo Accords, I believe there's no peace with the PLO, there's no peace with Hamas, there's no peace with the PIJ. We have to look at their actions, the history, and the overall corruption that is in these groups. The Palestinian people and the Israeli people deserve to coexist, and they deserve much more than a corrupt group like the PLO.",subjective

They exist another Thing that I'm going to address a lot of people were concerned for me Because they wanted me to take a position of neutrality and this is gotten to a point where if you are trying to hold a position of neutrality You are trying to appease the wrong kind of people and I already said that I was pro-Palestine and You know I'm not going to be neutral on this I from the get go I was supporting Palestine it is just Have just being human you don't want death for anyone that is just a human thing, okay? It's not about a being a neutral nobody wants death, okay? Let's just put that out of the way What I don't understand is people are upset with Palestinian people specifically Hamas Because they're like why was Hamas violent? Israel was violent first. Did you do you see what I mean like you you can't be surprised that violence is being met with violence Every day more and more of the arguments used by the pro-Israeli people Have began to be proven false the whole 40 headed 40 baby thing proven false AI generated images false even this person They kept saying about a woman being raped and all that kind of stuff that has been proven false She is alive and she's in a Palestinian Hospital in Gaza she is alive and she's being taken care of by Palestinian people I mean you even are seeing clips and Articles of CNN reporters Faking and or admitting to lies. I mean even now Old Israeli government officials have begun to admit that they were fighting they were they were providing Resources and financial Like paying Hamas Israel created Hamas this person I said to them Israel created created Hamas and they were like how couldn't they? They did They literally created Hamas to oppose the PLO the Palestinian leftist organization I think that's what the PLO sense were but they wanted to disrupt What Palestine was doing to give them an excuse to unleash genocide to destroy and take the Khazakh strip What happened during World War II nobody is denying is a terrible awful thing Nobody is denying that okay the Genocide of Jewish people during the Holocaust was a terrible and awful thing and Jewish people deserve to have a place where they feel safe Where they can you know if they want a country they deserve to have that I'm not denying that But not at the expense of Committing another genocide against another group of people you can literally Google the images Because like over like the last 70 something years you can see how Israel The Israeli government and the settle their settlers colonizers have progressively taken more and more Palestinian land to the point where there is only this 25 mile long strip of land that remains that is the Khazakh strip and over 2.2 million Palestinian people live there and The thing that drives me nuts about some of these pro-Israeli Comments as they're always like what about the children what about the children? Over half of the population It's under the age of 18 Keep that in mind and this is part of the reason why I will refer I refuse to continue interacting with these kind of people especially ones that are severely cruel if you are Unformed at this point You have the ability to get informed You have like the world at your fingertips you can choose to inform yourself If you're misinformed Check your resources. I mean so many places have been proven wrong That's all I can say but like if you're just cruel like this person They thought I was Palestinian because if you go back and look at their comments, they're like your government as in like the Palestinian government I am not Palestinian. I'm American I'm white like white white And the way they spoke to me because they thought I was Palestinian Just shows how these people treat actual Palestinian people not once Did they refer to the children? To the civilians of Palestine as people Did them refer to them as children as innocent lives or anything like that they refer to them every single time as human meat shields and There's this argument if like Hamas would just give themselves up like They wouldn't have to die like it's not leave that area of a Khazaa it is literally not that hard It is though because there you Israel controls everything That Khazaa has including the exits they have bombed the exits routes. I have watched actual video footage of the Khazaa Egypt exit being bombed Where are these people to go and to say stuff like this is so incredibly insensitive and ignorant and I will not talk with these people anymore I won't do it and people will be upset with me for saying this for being in support of Palestine and At that I want to say that you don't know me You don't know me because if you go through my page I Have been speaking out against things.

We're looking at chapter four of the Hundred Years War on Palestine, which specifically focuses on 1982. Because of American backing for Israel in tolerance of its actions, its supplies of arms and munitions for use against civilians, its coercion of the PLO to leave Beirut and refusal to deal directly with it, and its worthless assurances of protection, the 1982 invasion must be seen as a joint Israel-US military endeavor. Their first war aimed specifically against Palestinians. In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon. In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon, in large part because the Palestine Liberation Organization, the PLO, was housed there. The PLO was created in 1964 by the Arab League in an effort to control Palestinian nationalism while seeming to support them. In 1960, it was based in Jordan, and in 1970, it was driven out and went to Lebanon. Lebanese civil war began in 1975. Major factors for this war include the interference of the French between World War I and World War II, and multiple waves of influxes of Palestinian refugees. Ten weeks since, by the Israeli army, against the Lebanese capital Beirut, was the first war since 1948 to mainly involve Palestinians. During the 10-week siege, 19,000 were killed and 30,000 wounded, mostly civilians. Israel cut off food, water, fuel, electricity, and in addition to its indiscriminate bombardment of all of Beirut, they also attacked multiple refugee camps. In Beirut, there was continuous bombing, shelling of neighborhoods, and car bombs. This blanket bombardment was designed to create terror. And to turn anyone there against the PLO. Now let's get to Reagan. He provided 1.4 billion in military aid to Israel in both 1981 and 1982. Like the Presidents, before him, he made many uncapped promises to the Arab nations. And when he slashed his government, pressured the PLO into leaving, they failed to make any safeguards for the civilians left behind. While the PLO left on the condition that the civilians would be safe, Israel did not keep that promise because there were no formal sanctions in place. And many of the attacks on the refugee camps happened after the fighting was over. Israel didn't do this dirty work itself. It sent the Lebanese front, the LF. This was one of the sides of the Civil War. This was the right wing side. That was backed by Israel. They were armed. They were funded. They were trained and they were sent by Israel to mop up where they Israel knew how much the LF hated Palestinians and how they would treat them. And they massacred many. And because Israel knew this, and because the US funded Israel and supported Israel, that is why the author argues what I started with, which is that it needs to be seen as a joint attack against Palestinians.",subjective

Let's talk about it. So after the 1967 war, the Six Day War, where the Arab countries attacked Israel, the PLO, the Palestinian Liberation Organization, ended up retreating back into Jordan. By the way, the PLO is basically an umbrella organization that kind of encapsulates all the Palestinian guerrilla groups at that time. So Fatah is one of those groups, one of the factions that was led by Yasser Adafat, an Egyptian man, and they basically used Jordan to launch attacks into Israel. And honestly, they had some victories to a point where they gained a lot of credibility, they gained over 20,000 new members, and it got millions from the Gulf states. So this is where it gets a little bit iffy. The PLO got a little Tukaki in Jordan. They patrol the roads in Aman, they impose illegal taxes on the Jordanian people. They even tried to assassinate King Hussein of Jordan. So after all of this chaos, Jordan was not having it after the 1971 civil war. Jordan kicked the PLO out, and the PLO said, where we go? Lebanon. So the PLO continued their terror attacks against Israel from Lebanon this time. The PLO was creating a civil war between the Muslims and the Christians, and the PLO killed off over 100,000 Lebanese Christians and made so many refugees. And the region was fearing an expanded war to a point where Israel and Syria had to actually intervene on the side of the Christians. So in my opinion, even with the illusion of the Oslo Accords, I believe there's no peace with the PLO, there's no peace with Hamas, there's no peace with the PIJ. We have to look at their actions, the history, and the overall corruption that is in these groups. The Palestinian people and the Israeli people deserve to coexist, and they deserve much more than a corrupt group like the PLO.",subjective

I saw someone on TikTok say it gets to a point people who are supporting the actions of the israel government are either misinformed uninformed or cruel And this person is cruel and I'm not saying people should go attack them or anything like that But they will be made as an example because they will not leave my page alone and they are seeing awful things Once again not all Jewish people back the actions of the Settler colonial regime that is the israeli government, okay, so If someone is Jewish you cannot just be anti-Semitic to them Because of what israel is doing, okay, that's not what I'm talking about and but at the same time People who are supporting Palestine are not anti-Semitic People are not against Jewish people they are against the israel government and the genocide that they are committing Let's get that clear because there are Palestinian people who are Jewish who are Christian, okay? They exist another Thing that I'm going to address a lot of people were concerned for me Because they wanted me to take a position of neutrality and this is gotten to a point where if you are trying to hold a position of neutrality You are trying to appease the wrong kind of people and I already said that I was pro-Palestine and You know I'm not going to be neutral on this I from the get go I was supporting Palestine it is just Have just being human you don't want death for anyone that is just a human thing, okay? It's not about a being a neutral nobody wants death, okay? Let's just put that out of the way What I don't understand is people are upset with Palestinian people specifically Hamas Because they're like why was Hamas violent? Israel was violent first. Did you do you see what I mean like you you can't be surprised that violence is being met with violence Every day more and more of the arguments used by the pro-Israeli people Have began to be proven false the whole 40 headed 40 baby thing proven false AI generated images false even this person They kept saying about a woman being raped and all that kind of stuff that has been proven false She is alive and she's in a Palestinian Hospital in Gaza she is alive and she's being taken care of by Palestinian people I mean you even are seeing clips and Articles of CNN reporters Faking and or admitting to lies. I mean even now Old Israeli government officials have begun to admit that they were fighting they were they were providing Resources and financial Like paying Hamas Israel created Hamas this person I said to them Israel created created Hamas and they were like how couldn't they? They did They literally created Hamas to oppose the PLO the Palestinian leftist organization I think that's what the PLO sense were but they wanted to disrupt What Palestine was doing to give them an excuse to unleash genocide to destroy and take the Khazakh strip What happened during World War II nobody is denying is a terrible awful thing Nobody is denying that okay the Genocide of Jewish people during the Holocaust was a terrible and awful thing and Jewish people deserve to have a place where they feel safe Where they can you know if they want a country they deserve to have that I'm not denying that But not at the expense of Committing another genocide against another group of people you can literally Google the images Because like over like the last 70 something years you can see how Israel The Israeli government and the settle their settlers colonizers have progressively taken more and more Palestinian land to the point where there is only this 25 mile long strip of land that remains that is the Khazakh strip and over 2.2 million Palestinian people live there and The thing that drives me nuts about some of these pro-Israeli Comments as they're always like what about the children what about the children? Over half of the population It's under the age of 18 Keep that in mind and this is part of the reason why I will refer I refuse to continue interacting with these kind of people especially ones that are severely cruel if you are Unformed at this point You have the ability to get informed You have like the world at your fingertips you can choose to inform yourself If you're misinformed Check your resources. I mean so many places have been proven wrong That's all I can say but like if you're just cruel like this person They thought I was Palestinian because if you go back and look at their comments, they're like your government as in like the Palestinian government I am not Palestinian. I'm American I'm white like white white And the way they spoke to me because they thought I was Palestinian Just shows how these people treat actual Palestinian people not once Did they refer to the children? To the civilians of Palestine as people Did them refer to them as children as innocent lives or anything like that they refer to them every single time as human meat shields and There's this argument if like Hamas would just give themselves up like They wouldn't have to die like it's not leave that area of a Khazaa it is literally not that hard It is though because there you Israel controls everything That Khazaa has including the exits they have bombed the exits routes. I have watched actual video footage of the Khazaa Egypt exit being bombed Where are these people to go and to say stuff like this is so incredibly insensitive and ignorant and I will not talk with these people anymore I won't do it and people will be upset with me for saying this for being in support of Palestine and At that I want to say that you don't know me You don't know me because if you go through my page I Have been speaking out against things.

I believe in due process of law, human rights law, public international law, and the reason why our world is so messed up is because none of that works, none of it applies.

Most of all, the poorest and most vulnerable populations, including Yemen, including in Gaza. That's why the United States launched Operation prosperity guardians. So it's about protecting the people in Gaza. But in 2010, Israel attacked six ships in the Red Sea attempting to deliver 10,000 pounds of aid to Gaza. It was called the Mavi Mammara incident. Israel bombed these ships and killed 10 people. They rationalized it saying we gave them a warning. They needed to go through our port, unload everything, and travel from Israel to Gaza through our 465,000 checkpoints. The ship said no, we're going to deliver directly to Gaza. Israel claimed self-defense, saying they were attacked. When hundreds of fighters came by air and sea to take over the ships, the UN did an investigation. Some of these people that died were shot 30 times. Some multiple times in the head. There was international outcry. No one was charged. No one went to jail.

Malaysian activists were on board the Mavi Marmara, which was carrying humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip when it was attacked in international waters by Israeli commandos. Nine Turkish citizens were killed during the assault ‚Äî one more died later of his wounds ‚Äî and Malaysia raged at the incident. Public support for Palestine has been high ever since.  One of the activists was my Dad,he was captured and hostile for 24 hours until luckily was released with no passport,belongings and traumatised by the shooting that occurred in front of his eyes. The heartbreaking incident certainly left an impact on everyone involved, so my father often reminded us to always support humanitarian efforts and uphold humanity. I myself have been involved in NGOs, specifically in sending special aid to local,Palestine, Syria and Rohingya .With the background of my father's NGO‚Äôs association that were passed down to me back then,here I want to emphasize that the tribes whom are cruel and commit murders should be our enemies, with the economy being strained by them, then our duty as Muslims is to do what is recommended, perhaps with this small amount of help we can contribute to a larger volume in blocking or at least dampening their income.

On May 31, Israeli authorities contacted the ship and told them to redirect to Ashtad, and free Gaza movement communicated that they were going to Gaza. So, during the night of May 31, Flotilla did not comply with Israeli directives, so the Israeli military decided to activate helicopters approached and armed troops repelled down onto the ships. The biggest attack was on the Mavimarmara, one of the biggest ships. They attacked with tear gas, stun guns, and guns. Most of the passengers reacted non-violently. Some had white flags that was reported. But once it became clear that these armed men were going to board the ship, some reacted violently. During the assault, Israeli troops beat an open fire on primarily non-violent activists. Some activists use clubs and change to beat the commandos with. At the end of the brief and chaotic and bloody attack, you had dozens of activist injured and nine activists dead. At the end of the attack, Israeli forces towed the ships to Israeli shore and said that they agreed to deliver the humanitarian aid, as long as it did not violate their black aid on Gaza. But Hamas said that they wanted to break the black aid and not just receive goods, so they refused to accept the aid and Israel never delivered it. Now, interestingly enough, on June 17, Israel announced a relaxation of the black aid. Of course, all of the activists were placed in Israeli detention. They were released between June 1 and June 6. Now, of course, Israel's saved international severe criticism, the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross, both released reports criticizing Israel's actions.

My name is Suzanne Malner, I'm the Executive Director of Beirut Beyond, and I have spent 19 years working with Palestinian refugees. Now, for context, I would go back to Part one to get context on this, but we left off on May 30, 2010 with the Flotilla, six ships leaving Cyprus for Gaza. Let's go. On May 31, Israeli authorities contacted the ship and told them to redirect to Ashtad, and free Gaza movement communicated that they were going to Gaza. So, during the night of May 31, Flotilla did not comply with Israeli directives, so the Israeli military decided to activate helicopters approached and armed troops repelled down onto the ships. The biggest attack was on the Mavimarmara, one of the biggest ships. They attacked with tear gas, stun guns, and guns. Most of the passengers reacted non-violently. Some had white flags that was reported. But once it became clear that these armed men were going to board the ship, some reacted violently. During the assault, Israeli troops beat an open fire on primarily non-violent activists. Some activists use clubs and change to beat the commandos with. At the end of the brief and chaotic and bloody attack, you had dozens of activist injured and nine activists dead. At the end of the attack, Israeli forces towed the ships to Israeli shore and said that they agreed to deliver the humanitarian aid, as long as it did not violate their black aid on Gaza. But Hamas said that they wanted to break the black aid and not just receive goods, so they refused to accept the aid and Israel never delivered it. Now, interestingly enough, on June 17, Israel announced a relaxation of the black aid. Of course, all of the activists were placed in Israeli detention. They were released between June 1 and June 6. Now, of course, Israel's saved international severe criticism, the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross, both released reports criticizing Israel's actions. And since the majority of the activists were Turkish, Israel's relationship with Turkey was severely fractured.

So, during the night of May 31, Flotilla did not comply with Israeli directives, so the Israeli military decided to activate helicopters approached and armed troops repelled down onto the ships. The biggest attack was on the Mavimarmara, one of the biggest ships. They attacked with tear gas, stun guns, and guns. Most of the passengers reacted non-violently. Some had white flags that was reported. But once it became clear that these armed men were going to board the ship, some reacted violently. During the assault, Israeli troops beat an open fire on primarily non-violent activists. Some activists use clubs and change to beat the commandos with. At the end of the brief and chaotic and bloody attack, you had dozens of activist injured and nine activists dead. At the end of the attack, Israeli forces towed the ships to Israeli shore and said that they agreed to deliver the humanitarian aid, as long as it did not violate their black aid on Gaza. But Hamas said that they wanted to break the black aid and not just receive goods, so they refused to accept the aid and Israel never delivered it. Now, interestingly enough, on June 17, Israel announced a relaxation of the black aid. Of course, all of the activists were placed in Israeli detention. They were released between June 1 and June 6. Now, of course, Israel's saved international severe criticism, the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross, both released reports criticizing Israel's actions.

Malaysian activists were on board the Mavi Marmara, which was carrying humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip when it was attacked in international waters by Israeli commandos. Nine Turkish citizens were killed during the assault ‚Äî one more died later of his wounds ‚Äî and Malaysia raged at the incident. Public support for Palestine has been high ever since.  One of the activists was my Dad,he was captured and hostile for 24 hours until luckily was released with no passport,belongings and traumatised by the shooting that occurred in front of his eyes. The heartbreaking incident certainly left an impact on everyone involved, so my father often reminded us to always support humanitarian efforts and uphold humanity. I myself have been involved in NGOs, specifically in sending special aid to local,Palestine, Syria and Rohingya .With the background of my father's NGO‚Äôs association that were passed down to me back then,here I want to emphasize that the tribes whom are cruel and commit murders should be our enemies, with the economy being strained by them, then our duty as Muslims is to do what is recommended, perhaps with this small amount of help we can contribute to a larger volume in blocking or at least dampening their income. If you have ever set foot in any refugee camp anywhere in this world you will understand what they are going through,the suffering is unimaginable. Then with this,may God leave us a great feeling of sympathy, how grateful we should be for all the blessings we get,always be kind to people because without us realizing it may be our last day with our loved ones or simply the last good deeds we left behind.Atleast with a sweet memory to be remembered by those who will be still living. #journalbyjane#writersoftiktok#readersoftiktok#sharingiscaring#visitisrael#freepalestine#fyp ",False,,justaplainjane_,Lujain‚òÅÔ∏è,,,,,,False,Mavi Marmara (Gaza Flotilla Incident),2023,@justaplainjane__video_7296824184997514503.txt, ƒ∞yi misin?

I‚Äôm so proud of your spirit my brother and a picture of my dad with his teamü§ç It started with two incidents represent turning points in Malaysian support for Palestine: the Mavi Marmara ‚ÄúFreedom Flotilla‚Äù incident, The first took place in 2010 and boosted public support in Malaysia in an unprecedented way. Malaysian activists were on board the Mavi Marmara, which was carrying humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip when it was attacked in international waters by Israeli commandos. Nine Turkish citizens were killed during the assault ‚Äî one more died later of his wounds ‚Äî and Malaysia raged at the incident. Public support for Palestine has been high ever since.  One of the activists was my Dad,he was captured and hostile for 24 hours until luckily was released with no passport,belongings and traumatised by the shooting that occurred in front of his eyes. The heartbreaking incident certainly left an impact on everyone involved, so my father often reminded us to always support humanitarian efforts and uphold humanity. I myself have been involved in NGOs, specifically in sending special aid to local,Palestine, Syria and Rohingya .With the background of my father's NGO‚Äôs association that were passed down to me back then,here I want to emphasize that the tribes whom are cruel and commit murders should be our enemies, with the economy being strained by them, then our duty as Muslims is to do what is recommended, perhaps with this small amount of help we can contribute to a larger volume in blocking or at least dampening their income. If you have ever set foot in any refugee camp anywhere in this world you will understand what they are going through,the suffering is unimaginable. Then with this,may God leave us a great feeling of sympathy, how grateful we should be for all the blessings we get,always be kind to people because without us realizing it may be our last day with our loved ones or simply the last good deeds we left behind.Atleast with a sweet memory to be remembered by those who will be still living. #journalbyjane#writersoftiktok#readersoftiktok#sharingiscaring#visitisrael#freepalestine#fyp ",False,,justaplainjane_,Lujain‚òÅÔ∏è,,,,,,False,Mavi Marmara (Gaza Flotilla Incident),2023,@justaplainjane__video_7296824184997514503.txt, ƒ∞yi misin?

Now, for context, I would go back to Part one to get context on this, but we left off on May 30, 2010 with the Flotilla, six ships leaving Cyprus for Gaza. Let's go. On May 31, Israeli authorities contacted the ship and told them to redirect to Ashtad, and free Gaza movement communicated that they were going to Gaza. So, during the night of May 31, Flotilla did not comply with Israeli directives, so the Israeli military decided to activate helicopters approached and armed troops repelled down onto the ships. The biggest attack was on the Mavimarmara, one of the biggest ships. They attacked with tear gas, stun guns, and guns. Most of the passengers reacted non-violently. Some had white flags that was reported. But once it became clear that these armed men were going to board the ship, some reacted violently. During the assault, Israeli troops beat an open fire on primarily non-violent activists. Some activists use clubs and change to beat the commandos with. At the end of the brief and chaotic and bloody attack, you had dozens of activist injured and nine activists dead. At the end of the attack, Israeli forces towed the ships to Israeli shore and said that they agreed to deliver the humanitarian aid, as long as it did not violate their black aid on Gaza. But Hamas said that they wanted to break the black aid and not just receive goods, so they refused to accept the aid and Israel never delivered it. Now, interestingly enough, on June 17, Israel announced a relaxation of the black aid. Of course, all of the activists were placed in Israeli detention. They were released between June 1 and June 6. Now, of course, Israel's saved international severe criticism, the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross, both released reports criticizing Israel's actions. And since the majority of the activists were Turkish, Israel's relationship with Turkey was severely fractured.

And there's so much double standard when people talk about this issue. And I'll give you two examples. I don't know if you heard Bibin et Tha'Niau speech at the United Nations. I heard it not live, but after he actually delivered it. And he began it with probably the tomb of striking examples of a myth and double standard. And he began by talking about the right of return of the Jews to their ancient homeland. And of course the Jews that returned, so-called returned to their homeland, were not exactly the same Jews who were expelled from their homeland. Because these were expelled a couple of thousand years before that. These were not their descendants either because they- this has been a very long time. So these are people, the people that actually came back, so to speak, are people that claim some kind of a heritage, some kind of a connection or a relationship to the ancient Hebrews. And they claimed that they had the right to return to their homeland. This was what Zionism was about and this was accepted by the world. As the right, they had the right to return. Now if we talk about the right of return of what nation you'd expect that there would be, if we accept it as a principle, then you'd expect that we'd accept it in general across the board. Yet when people talk about the right of return of Palestinians to their homeland, suddenly a red line comes up and everybody says, no, we can't talk about the right of return of the Palestinians. This has to be taken off the table. This is not negotiable. The right of return of the Palestinians is not acceptable. What's interesting about that is that the right of return of the Palestinians, we're talking about, quite often, we talk about the actual people who had to leave their homes. And if they had already passed away, then we're talking about their direct descendants. People who still have the keys and the deeds to their homes, and quite often can go to the very spot where a village existed, where today there might be a highway, and we'll point out the mosque, and we'll point out the well, and we'll point out the door to their home. Yet they do not enjoy the right to return. So obviously this is a double standard of immense proportions. The other thing BB talked about right off as he started was about King David, who reigned some 3,000 years ago, and here we are today as his descendants. What's interesting is, besides the fact that there is no historical evidence that King David ever existed, outside the Bible, which of course is not a historical document. And Israeli archaeologists have all but turned up the entire country to find proof that he ever existed. Today, as we speak, an entire town and entire community is being kicked out of their homes and forced into exile through violence in order to prove the King David existed in a place called Silwan. It's a community of 50,000 people right outside the walls of the old city of Jerusalem. Yet the world sees nothing wrong with this. American money is poured into this project to build what is called the new city of David, an archaeological park, and a community of 50,000 Palestinians has to be terrorized in order to leave their homes are being destroyed in order to make this point.

The key is the most symbolic symbol to Palestinians and most specifically to Palestinian refugees, as it represents their right of return. At least 750,000 Palestinians were forced out of their homes during the ethnic cleansing of 1948, also known as the Nakhba. Zionist forces invaded historic Palestine and captured 78% of Palestinian land. Hundreds of Palestinian villages were destroyed and some 15,000 Palestinians were killed. Israel banned most Palestinian refugees from ever returning to their homes. Due to the creation of Israel taking place in such a short amount of time, we saw huge numbers of Palestinian's become refugees and they were forced to leave and flee their homes, leaving everything but behind. Except one thing, the key to their homes and they kept this key on the belief that one day they would return. There are about 6 million Palestinian refugees in the occupied West Bank, Gaza and neighbouring countries. Many still cling to the hope of returning home and the key represents that. You'll see a huge number of these Palestinian refugees still holding onto their keys of their homes from before 1948 and this become kind of this unspoken generational gift onto the next generation. But if that generation who's holding onto the key of their home at that time, if they are not physically able to live to see a decolonized Palestine and to go back to their home, they'll pass on to that key onto the next generation. Many older Palestinians still remember their lives and homes before the Nakhba took place and hope to return. I find it both heartbreaking and angering to see that we have to see yet another generation pass on these keys to their grandchildren, to their own children and it's not them themselves returning to Palestine. As a part of Qifle-Ti'at we say we want to see return within our lifetimes and we want to see our elders, not their grandchildren, not their great-great-grandchildren, but the our elders, the ones who personally had to flee from the Nakhba, we want to see them return in our lifetimes. For our founded Qifle-Ti'at in 2017 to mark 100 years of the Balfour Declaration, that's when the British government gave support for an adjouish homeland in Palestine. When we created this, we wanted a visible symbol for people to see that one of the key solutions to Palestine isn't this regurgitated, insincere rhetoric or two-state solution, but one of the key solutions in itself is our key is our right to pattern. The right to pattern lies at the heart of what should happen next when we talk about Palestine, which is decolonization, which is dismantling these really settler colonial projects. Key 48 has issued over 10,000 symbolic keys and 30 countries to raise awareness about Palestinian rights. The group has been supported by Bella Hadid and Roger Waters. And that's the most important point to acknowledge, or we are talking about Palestine and Israel, because this is a settler colonial situation, this isn't a situation between of religion, of conflicts, and the right to return pinpoint jobs that this is an issue with settler colonialism, as every single settler colony throughout history has always viewed the native people as a demographic threat.",subjective

And he began by talking about the right of return of the Jews to their ancient homeland. And of course the Jews that returned, so-called returned to their homeland, were not exactly the same Jews who were expelled from their homeland. Because these were expelled a couple of thousand years before that. These were not their descendants either because they- this has been a very long time. So these are people, the people that actually came back, so to speak, are people that claim some kind of a heritage, some kind of a connection or a relationship to the ancient Hebrews. And they claimed that they had the right to return to their homeland. This was what Zionism was about and this was accepted by the world. As the right, they had the right to return. Now if we talk about the right of return of what nation you'd expect that there would be, if we accept it as a principle, then you'd expect that we'd accept it in general across the board. Yet when people talk about the right of return of Palestinians to their homeland, suddenly a red line comes up and everybody says, no, we can't talk about the right of return of the Palestinians. This has to be taken off the table. This is not negotiable. The right of return of the Palestinians is not acceptable. What's interesting about that is that the right of return of the Palestinians, we're talking about, quite often, we talk about the actual people who had to leave their homes.

And Israeli archaeologists have all but turned up the entire country to find proof that he ever existed.

It's a community of 50,000 people right outside the walls of the old city of Jerusalem. Yet the world sees nothing wrong with this. American money is poured into this project to build what is called the new city of David, an archaeological park, and a community of 50,000 Palestinians has to be terrorized in order to leave their homes are being destroyed in order to make this point.

The key is the most symbolic symbol to Palestinians and most specifically to Palestinian refugees, as it represents their right of return. At least 750,000 Palestinians were forced out of their homes during the ethnic cleansing of 1948, also known as the Nakhba. Zionist forces invaded historic Palestine and captured 78% of Palestinian land. Hundreds of Palestinian villages were destroyed and some 15,000 Palestinians were killed. Israel banned most Palestinian refugees from ever returning to their homes. Due to the creation of Israel taking place in such a short amount of time, we saw huge numbers of Palestinian's become refugees and they were forced to leave and flee their homes, leaving everything but behind. Except one thing, the key to their homes and they kept this key on the belief that one day they would return. There are about 6 million Palestinian refugees in the occupied West Bank, Gaza and neighbouring countries. Many still cling to the hope of returning home and the key represents that. You'll see a huge number of these Palestinian refugees still holding onto their keys of their homes from before 1948 and this become kind of this unspoken generational gift onto the next generation. But if that generation who's holding onto the key of their home at that time, if they are not physically able to live to see a decolonized Palestine and to go back to their home, they'll pass on to that key onto the next generation. Many older Palestinians still remember their lives and homes before the Nakhba took place and hope to return. I find it both heartbreaking and angering to see that we have to see yet another generation pass on these keys to their grandchildren, to their own children and it's not them themselves returning to Palestine. As a part of Qifle-Ti'at we say we want to see return within our lifetimes and we want to see our elders, not their grandchildren, not their great-great-grandchildren, but the our elders, the ones who personally had to flee from the Nakhba, we want to see them return in our lifetimes. For our founded Qifle-Ti'at in 2017 to mark 100 years of the Balfour Declaration, that's when the British government gave support for an adjouish homeland in Palestine. When we created this, we wanted a visible symbol for people to see that one of the key solutions to Palestine isn't this regurgitated, insincere rhetoric or two-state solution, but one of the key solutions in itself is our key is our right to pattern. The right to pattern lies at the heart of what should happen next when we talk about Palestine, which is decolonization, which is dismantling these really settler colonial projects. Key 48 has issued over 10,000 symbolic keys and 30 countries to raise awareness about Palestinian rights. The group has been supported by Bella Hadid and Roger Waters. And that's the most important point to acknowledge, or we are talking about Palestine and Israel, because this is a settler colonial situation, this isn't a situation between of religion, of conflicts, and the right to return pinpoint jobs that this is an issue with settler colonialism, as every single settler colony throughout history has always viewed the native people as a demographic threat.",subjective

And over 15,000 Palestinians were killed. As Palestinians were expelled from their homes, they held onto their keys, believing that they would be returning after a few weeks. The key is a symbol that Palestinians have the right to return. We are witnessing a second Nakba this time in 2023. 1.8 million Palestinians in Gaza have been displaced. Their homes have been blown up. And over 20,000 Palestinians have been killed. As we witness a second Nakba, the key remains relevant.

At least 750,000 Palestinians were forced out of their homes during the ethnic cleansing of 1948, also known as the Nakhba. Zionist forces invaded historic Palestine and captured 78% of Palestinian land. Hundreds of Palestinian villages were destroyed and some 15,000 Palestinians were killed. Israel banned most Palestinian refugees from ever returning to their homes. Due to the creation of Israel taking place in such a short amount of time, we saw huge numbers of Palestinian's become refugees and they were forced to leave and flee their homes, leaving everything but behind. Except one thing, the key to their homes and they kept this key on the belief that one day they would return. There are about 6 million Palestinian refugees in the occupied West Bank, Gaza and neighbouring countries. Many still cling to the hope of returning home and the key represents that. You'll see a huge number of these Palestinian refugees still holding onto their keys of their homes from before 1948 and this become kind of this unspoken generational gift onto the next generation. But if that generation who's holding onto the key of their home at that time, if they are not physically able to live to see a decolonized Palestine and to go back to their home, they'll pass on to that key onto the next generation. Many older Palestinians still remember their lives and homes before the Nakhba took place and hope to return. I find it both heartbreaking and angering to see that we have to see yet another generation pass on these keys to their grandchildren, to their own children and it's not them themselves returning to Palestine. As a part of Qifle-Ti'at we say we want to see return within our lifetimes and we want to see our elders, not their grandchildren, not their great-great-grandchildren, but the our elders, the ones who personally had to flee from the Nakhba, we want to see them return in our lifetimes. For our founded Qifle-Ti'at in 2017 to mark 100 years of the Balfour Declaration, that's when the British government gave support for an adjouish homeland in Palestine. When we created this, we wanted a visible symbol for people to see that one of the key solutions to Palestine isn't this regurgitated, insincere rhetoric or two-state solution, but one of the key solutions in itself is our key is our right to pattern. The right to pattern lies at the heart of what should happen next when we talk about Palestine, which is decolonization, which is dismantling these really settler colonial projects. Key 48 has issued over 10,000 symbolic keys and 30 countries to raise awareness about Palestinian rights. The group has been supported by Bella Hadid and Roger Waters. And that's the most important point to acknowledge, or we are talking about Palestine and Israel, because this is a settler colonial situation, this isn't a situation between of religion, of conflicts, and the right to return pinpoint jobs that this is an issue with settler colonialism, as every single settler colony throughout history has always viewed the native people as a demographic threat.",subjective

And there's so much double standard when people talk about this issue. And I'll give you two examples. I don't know if you heard Bibin et Tha'Niau speech at the United Nations. I heard it not live, but after he actually delivered it. And he began it with probably the tomb of striking examples of a myth and double standard. And he began by talking about the right of return of the Jews to their ancient homeland. And of course the Jews that returned, so-called returned to their homeland, were not exactly the same Jews who were expelled from their homeland. Because these were expelled a couple of thousand years before that. These were not their descendants either because they- this has been a very long time. So these are people, the people that actually came back, so to speak, are people that claim some kind of a heritage, some kind of a connection or a relationship to the ancient Hebrews. And they claimed that they had the right to return to their homeland. This was what Zionism was about and this was accepted by the world. As the right, they had the right to return. Now if we talk about the right of return of what nation you'd expect that there would be, if we accept it as a principle, then you'd expect that we'd accept it in general across the board. Yet when people talk about the right of return of Palestinians to their homeland, suddenly a red line comes up and everybody says, no, we can't talk about the right of return of the Palestinians. This has to be taken off the table. This is not negotiable. The right of return of the Palestinians is not acceptable. What's interesting about that is that the right of return of the Palestinians, we're talking about, quite often, we talk about the actual people who had to leave their homes. And if they had already passed away, then we're talking about their direct descendants. People who still have the keys and the deeds to their homes, and quite often can go to the very spot where a village existed, where today there might be a highway, and we'll point out the mosque, and we'll point out the well, and we'll point out the door to their home. Yet they do not enjoy the right to return. So obviously this is a double standard of immense proportions. The other thing BB talked about right off as he started was about King David, who reigned some 3,000 years ago, and here we are today as his descendants. What's interesting is, besides the fact that there is no historical evidence that King David ever existed, outside the Bible, which of course is not a historical document. And Israeli archaeologists have all but turned up the entire country to find proof that he ever existed. Today, as we speak, an entire town and entire community is being kicked out of their homes and forced into exile through violence in order to prove the King David existed in a place called Silwan. It's a community of 50,000 people right outside the walls of the old city of Jerusalem. Yet the world sees nothing wrong with this. American money is poured into this project to build what is called the new city of David, an archaeological park, and a community of 50,000 Palestinians has to be terrorized in order to leave their homes are being destroyed in order to make this point.

So I had a log going on this day and even though I messed up my sleep schedule for like three to four days, it was so worth it. So I believe I woke up in between 3.34. Um, I'm not a morning person at all, so that just felt really weird. Also walking through the city at this early in the morning was really strange because as you can see there is nobody out. Um, it was really quiet, but it wasn't an eerie kind of quiet. It was more of a peaceful kind of quiet. The reason why I headed out so early is because I was going to a really popular Christian Holy site. And I wanted to get there before the tourist crowds saw it like, yeah, we're going to pass that. So this is the church of the Holy Stupider and it just believed that this is the place where Jesus was crucified and buried. The stone site you see here is called the Stone of Anointing and this is where it is believed when Jesus was taken down from the cross that he was laid on to prepare for burial. The paintings in this church were absolutely stunning. When I got there, they were doing their morning mess and I was not raised Catholic, so I would be hella confused sometimes, but I was next to somebody during the ceremony and they kind of showed me what to do, so that was really nice. I just walked around the church a little bit because no disrespect, but the mass thought really repetitive. It's just a flaw of me. I've always thought church was really boring. So this room contains the whole where it just believed that the cross was placed when Jesus was crucified. It was just so nice to be here. I think that hearing these stories on my life to actually come here and see it in person was such a surreal moment. So after leaving the sun came out and I'm glad I got there when I did because it was already getting crowded as you could see as I was leaving. And then I walked to my next destination. So this walk I had to go to a part of the city that I didn't really know a lot about. So I was really worried about getting lost, but I'm glad I didn't. And I had to walk around a little bit because the site wasn't open yet. So for my story is when I got here, I actually got turned around in this garden because I was trying to find the tomb because they were having a little church sermon or not only a church sermon, like a two-work thing. And I didn't really want to be a part of it because I didn't want to be stuck there for two hours. I just wanted to see the tomb and go. And I was like, all turned around. I was like, where is this tomb? So this is a garden tomb and it was discovered in 1867. So Catholic tradition always held that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was where Jesus was crucified and buried. But some people kind of disputed that. So even in Geolacles and Protestants think that this is the place where Jesus was actually buried at. So they believe that Jesus was crucified at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and then he was brought to this location, which is kind of outside the city limits a little bit and that this is where he was actually buried. Then I headed to my next destination, which this is one of those times where you look at your phone and you think it's going to be later than it actually is because I think it was only like 10 o'clock at this time. And I was like, it feels like it should be like 5 o'clock in the evening. But I was like, oh, I forgot. I woke up at like 3 o'clock this morning. The only enjoyable thing about this walk was that it was all downhill because if I had to walk this uphill, I would even call the plate even going to this next destination. I probably would have gone eventually. I would just be complaining the whole time. But this is one of the only times the walk was actually enjoyable. So this is the tomb of the Virgin Mary, Mother of Jesus. And this was one of my favorite places to come. You had to go down all these stairs and the temperature dropped significantly. I was stunned. And the main hall was stunning. I loved all these chandeliers and candles and lights. I loved all of it. It was so beautiful, especially the art on the wall too. And another sultras where it is believed that Mary is buried. And as you can see, people give her offerings and prayers and she's really highly revered in the Catholic tradition. So a lot of people make pilgrimage here to pay her their respects to the Mary Mother of Jesus. And then I took a taxi back because I gagged up the thought of walking up that hill again. I'm sure you're lucky for more. This is my last travel vlog from this trip. I loved going to Israel and Palestine. It was just an amazing experience.

So this is actually one of my favorite days outside the fact that I got lost twice. So my days started off by heading to the old city and making it to the first stop of the day. So this is the western wall and it is the holy site in Judaism. It was a part of where herds simple stood from 516 BC till 70 AD. None as the second temple period. You would see many people here praying and reading scripture. And it is also believed that if repairs were written down and put inside the wall that it will be answered by God. They were also having a few appointments with celebrations and that was a really cool to see. So after that I made my way to my second destination. So this is one of the other times that I actually got lost because the sign said that it was at the end of the tunnel but there was not another sign that said you had to go left. So I kept going straight and I was like hmm this doesn't look right. I had to stop and ask somebody so I could find it. This is known as a small western wall. I actually screwed up here a little bit because I didn't know that you had to go all the way through to see the actual wall. But I'm glad that I read that this tunnel was actually dates back to the second temple period. So I didn't totally stir up. Okay going to my next destination was the worst. You see these stairs? There was about 100 more of them. And going down the street was actually a dead end. Then I went the wrong way again on one street so I had to walk up another flight of stairs and these stairs were pissing me off. So at this point I said screwed. I'm hungry. I need something to eat. And if you're ever in the Jewish quarter in the old city of Jerusalem you need to check this place out because that land burger was bomb. So after eating and asking for directions again I was finally on my way to my next destination. This part was straight walking in the heat and after a while I finally made it. I was so dead. So this is the tomb of David, one of the kings of Israel and actually one of the most popular. So yeah the place was a little crowded. I'm just kidding it was a lot crowded. There was a bunch of school kids there on like a field trip kind of day but it was still overall a good experience. And then after that I went back to my hostel and passed out from all the walking.

You will notice that there is one side of the wall where women pray and the other side where men pray. They will give men Yomikas and headscarce for the women. However, if you are not praying, they do not require women to wear the headscarce. This place is also very special in Muslim tradition as well.

It's an occupied Easter-Russelam, and the site is holy in Judaism, Islam, and Christianity too. Muslims usually refer to it as al-Aqsa, and Jews call it Temple Mount. It's a big compound that includes the al-Aqsa mosque and this shrine called Dome of the Rock, both very important to Muslims. For Jews, this site is where two ancient temples used to be, and it's considered so holy that most Jewish religious leaders say Jews aren't allowed to pray there. Instead, they pray outside the compound at the Western Wall. Now this place isn't the news a lot because what happens there tends to spill out. One example is this visit in 2000 by Israeli politician Ariel Shahron, which triggered a Palestinian uprising called the Second Intifada. Now there's a long-standing arrangement about who can access the site and what they can do. If you've heard of status quo, that's essentially what we're talking about. And it's basically this. Now, who actually controls who visits and who prays? Well, in theory, it's an Islamic trust known as the Wakaaf, but Israeli forces control many of the gates and the security outside the compound, because Easter-Russelam is under a military occupation by Israel. And this is where all the issues come up because Israeli forces are increasingly taking control of what goes on inside the compound, like restricting Muslims, especially Palestinians from entering, and turning a blind eye to Jews openly praying there. This year a lot of people were angry when Israel's new interior minister Ben Gavir went, and it was seen as a very provocative move. So here's the thing. You've got this really holy place, thousands of years of history, and what's supposed to be an established way of doing things, but it's changing, because we're seeing two trends play out there. One, there's the growing power of the far right in Israel, people who say Jews should be able to pray at the compound, and that it should be under Israeli control. And two, Palestinians living under Israeli occupation are increasingly seeing their rights, their land, and identity being erased. And when that happens at Al-Aqsa, they really see it as a final straw. By the way, we do these explainers about news topics all the time on my show start here.

I just walked around the church a little bit because no disrespect, but the mass thought really repetitive. It's just a flaw of me. I've always thought church was really boring. So this room contains the whole where it just believed that the cross was placed when Jesus was crucified. It was just so nice to be here. I think that hearing these stories on my life to actually come here and see it in person was such a surreal moment. So after leaving the sun came out and I'm glad I got there when I did because it was already getting crowded as you could see as I was leaving. And then I walked to my next destination. So this walk I had to go to a part of the city that I didn't really know a lot about. So I was really worried about getting lost, but I'm glad I didn't. And I had to walk around a little bit because the site wasn't open yet. So for my story is when I got here, I actually got turned around in this garden because I was trying to find the tomb because they were having a little church sermon or not only a church sermon, like a two-work thing. And I didn't really want to be a part of it because I didn't want to be stuck there for two hours. I just wanted to see the tomb and go. And I was like, all turned around. I was like, where is this tomb? So this is a garden tomb and it was discovered in 1867. So Catholic tradition always held that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was where Jesus was crucified and buried. But some people kind of disputed that. So even in Geolacles and Protestants think that this is the place where Jesus was actually buried at. So they believe that Jesus was crucified at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and then he was brought to this location, which is kind of outside the city limits a little bit and that this is where he was actually buried. Then I headed to my next destination, which this is one of those times where you look at your phone and you think it's going to be later than it actually is because I think it was only like 10 o'clock at this time. And I was like, it feels like it should be like 5 o'clock in the evening. But I was like, oh, I forgot. I woke up at like 3 o'clock this morning. The only enjoyable thing about this walk was that it was all downhill because if I had to walk this uphill, I would even call the plate even going to this next destination. I probably would have gone eventually. I would just be complaining the whole time. But this is one of the only times the walk was actually enjoyable. So this is the tomb of the Virgin Mary, Mother of Jesus. And this was one of my favorite places to come. You had to go down all these stairs and the temperature dropped significantly. I was stunned. And the main hall was stunning. I loved all these chandeliers and candles and lights. I loved all of it. It was so beautiful, especially the art on the wall too. And another sultras where it is believed that Mary is buried. And as you can see, people give her offerings and prayers and she's really highly revered in the Catholic tradition. So a lot of people make pilgrimage here to pay her their respects to the Mary Mother of Jesus. And then I took a taxi back because I gagged up the thought of walking up that hill again.

So this is actually one of my favorite days outside the fact that I got lost twice. So my days started off by heading to the old city and making it to the first stop of the day. So this is the western wall and it is the holy site in Judaism. It was a part of where herds simple stood from 516 BC till 70 AD. None as the second temple period. You would see many people here praying and reading scripture. And it is also believed that if repairs were written down and put inside the wall that it will be answered by God. They were also having a few appointments with celebrations and that was a really cool to see. So after that I made my way to my second destination. So this is one of the other times that I actually got lost because the sign said that it was at the end of the tunnel but there was not another sign that said you had to go left. So I kept going straight and I was like hmm this doesn't look right. I had to stop and ask somebody so I could find it. This is known as a small western wall. I actually screwed up here a little bit because I didn't know that you had to go all the way through to see the actual wall. But I'm glad that I read that this tunnel was actually dates back to the second temple period. So I didn't totally stir up. Okay going to my next destination was the worst. You see these stairs? There was about 100 more of them. And going down the street was actually a dead end. Then I went the wrong way again on one street so I had to walk up another flight of stairs and these stairs were pissing me off. So at this point I said screwed. I'm hungry. I need something to eat. And if you're ever in the Jewish quarter in the old city of Jerusalem you need to check this place out because that land burger was bomb. So after eating and asking for directions again I was finally on my way to my next destination. This part was straight walking in the heat and after a while I finally made it. I was so dead. So this is the tomb of David, one of the kings of Israel and actually one of the most popular. So yeah the place was a little crowded. I'm just kidding it was a lot crowded. There was a bunch of school kids there on like a field trip kind of day but it was still overall a good experience. And then after that I went back to my hostel and passed out from all the walking.

According to the Hebrew Bible, Solomon's Temple was built atop what is now known as the Temple Mount in the 10th century BCE, which makes it very important to the Jewish faith. You will notice that there is one side of the wall where women pray and the other side where men pray. They will give men Yomikas and headscarce for the women. However, if you are not praying, they do not require women to wear the headscarce. This place is also very special in Muslim tradition as well. It is believed to be the site where the Islamic prophet Muhammad ascended to Paradise. Security is very tight here as you can see, and you will be asked to go through a metal detector to enter.

It's an occupied Easter-Russelam, and the site is holy in Judaism, Islam, and Christianity too. Muslims usually refer to it as al-Aqsa, and Jews call it Temple Mount. It's a big compound that includes the al-Aqsa mosque and this shrine called Dome of the Rock, both very important to Muslims. For Jews, this site is where two ancient temples used to be, and it's considered so holy that most Jewish religious leaders say Jews aren't allowed to pray there. Instead, they pray outside the compound at the Western Wall. Now this place isn't the news a lot because what happens there tends to spill out. One example is this visit in 2000 by Israeli politician Ariel Shahron, which triggered a Palestinian uprising called the Second Intifada. Now there's a long-standing arrangement about who can access the site and what they can do. If you've heard of status quo, that's essentially what we're talking about. And it's basically this. Now, who actually controls who visits and who prays? Well, in theory, it's an Islamic trust known as the Wakaaf, but Israeli forces control many of the gates and the security outside the compound, because Easter-Russelam is under a military occupation by Israel. And this is where all the issues come up because Israeli forces are increasingly taking control of what goes on inside the compound, like restricting Muslims, especially Palestinians from entering, and turning a blind eye to Jews openly praying there. This year a lot of people were angry when Israel's new interior minister Ben Gavir went, and it was seen as a very provocative move. So here's the thing. You've got this really holy place, thousands of years of history, and what's supposed to be an established way of doing things, but it's changing, because we're seeing two trends play out there. One, there's the growing power of the far right in Israel, people who say Jews should be able to pray at the compound, and that it should be under Israeli control. And two, Palestinians living under Israeli occupation are increasingly seeing their rights, their land, and identity being erased. And when that happens at Al-Aqsa, they really see it as a final straw. By the way, we do these explainers about news topics all the time on my show start here.

You would see many people here praying and reading scripture. And it is also believed that if repairs were written down and put inside the wall that it will be answered by God. They were also having a few appointments with celebrations and that was a really cool to see. So after that I made my way to my second destination. So this is one of the other times that I actually got lost because the sign said that it was at the end of the tunnel but there was not another sign that said you had to go left. So I kept going straight and I was like hmm this doesn't look right. I had to stop and ask somebody so I could find it. This is known as a small western wall. I actually screwed up here a little bit because I didn't know that you had to go all the way through to see the actual wall. But I'm glad that I read that this tunnel was actually dates back to the second temple period. So I didn't totally stir up. Okay going to my next destination was the worst. You see these stairs? There was about 100 more of them. And going down the street was actually a dead end. Then I went the wrong way again on one street so I had to walk up another flight of stairs and these stairs were pissing me off. So at this point I said screwed. I'm hungry. I need something to eat. And if you're ever in the Jewish quarter in the old city of Jerusalem you need to check this place out because that land burger was bomb. So after eating and asking for directions again I was finally on my way to my next destination. This part was straight walking in the heat and after a while I finally made it. I was so dead. So this is the tomb of David, one of the kings of Israel and actually one of the most popular. So yeah the place was a little crowded. I'm just kidding it was a lot crowded. There was a bunch of school kids there on like a field trip kind of day but it was still overall a good experience. And then after that I went back to my hostel and passed out from all the walking.

It's an occupied Easter-Russelam, and the site is holy in Judaism, Islam, and Christianity too. Muslims usually refer to it as al-Aqsa, and Jews call it Temple Mount. It's a big compound that includes the al-Aqsa mosque and this shrine called Dome of the Rock, both very important to Muslims. For Jews, this site is where two ancient temples used to be, and it's considered so holy that most Jewish religious leaders say Jews aren't allowed to pray there. Instead, they pray outside the compound at the Western Wall. Now this place isn't the news a lot because what happens there tends to spill out. One example is this visit in 2000 by Israeli politician Ariel Shahron, which triggered a Palestinian uprising called the Second Intifada. Now there's a long-standing arrangement about who can access the site and what they can do. If you've heard of status quo, that's essentially what we're talking about. And it's basically this. Now, who actually controls who visits and who prays? Well, in theory, it's an Islamic trust known as the Wakaaf, but Israeli forces control many of the gates and the security outside the compound, because Easter-Russelam is under a military occupation by Israel. And this is where all the issues come up because Israeli forces are increasingly taking control of what goes on inside the compound, like restricting Muslims, especially Palestinians from entering, and turning a blind eye to Jews openly praying there. This year a lot of people were angry when Israel's new interior minister Ben Gavir went, and it was seen as a very provocative move. So here's the thing. You've got this really holy place, thousands of years of history, and what's supposed to be an established way of doing things, but it's changing, because we're seeing two trends play out there. One, there's the growing power of the far right in Israel, people who say Jews should be able to pray at the compound, and that it should be under Israeli control. And two, Palestinians living under Israeli occupation are increasingly seeing their rights, their land, and identity being erased. And when that happens at Al-Aqsa, they really see it as a final straw. By the way, we do these explainers about news topics all the time on my show start here.

The original temple was destroyed in 70 AD by the Romans, and all the Jewish people were exiled from the city. When they returned later on, the only remaining wall became a site of pilgrimage. It was where the Jewish people came to lament their tragic losses at the hands of the Romans, which is where it caught the name the wailing wall. The wall is immense, built of thick limestone 60 feet tall, but not everyone is convinced that the wall really was part of the temple.

So I had a log going on this day and even though I messed up my sleep schedule for like three to four days, it was so worth it. So I believe I woke up in between 3.34. Um, I'm not a morning person at all, so that just felt really weird. Also walking through the city at this early in the morning was really strange because as you can see there is nobody out. Um, it was really quiet, but it wasn't an eerie kind of quiet. It was more of a peaceful kind of quiet. The reason why I headed out so early is because I was going to a really popular Christian Holy site. And I wanted to get there before the tourist crowds saw it like, yeah, we're going to pass that. So this is the church of the Holy Stupider and it just believed that this is the place where Jesus was crucified and buried. The stone site you see here is called the Stone of Anointing and this is where it is believed when Jesus was taken down from the cross that he was laid on to prepare for burial. The paintings in this church were absolutely stunning. When I got there, they were doing their morning mess and I was not raised Catholic, so I would be hella confused sometimes, but I was next to somebody during the ceremony and they kind of showed me what to do, so that was really nice. I just walked around the church a little bit because no disrespect, but the mass thought really repetitive. It's just a flaw of me. I've always thought church was really boring. So this room contains the whole where it just believed that the cross was placed when Jesus was crucified. It was just so nice to be here. I think that hearing these stories on my life to actually come here and see it in person was such a surreal moment. So after leaving the sun came out and I'm glad I got there when I did because it was already getting crowded as you could see as I was leaving. And then I walked to my next destination. So this walk I had to go to a part of the city that I didn't really know a lot about. So I was really worried about getting lost, but I'm glad I didn't. And I had to walk around a little bit because the site wasn't open yet. So for my story is when I got here, I actually got turned around in this garden because I was trying to find the tomb because they were having a little church sermon or not only a church sermon, like a two-work thing. And I didn't really want to be a part of it because I didn't want to be stuck there for two hours. I just wanted to see the tomb and go. And I was like, all turned around. I was like, where is this tomb? So this is a garden tomb and it was discovered in 1867. So Catholic tradition always held that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was where Jesus was crucified and buried. But some people kind of disputed that. So even in Geolacles and Protestants think that this is the place where Jesus was actually buried at. So they believe that Jesus was crucified at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and then he was brought to this location, which is kind of outside the city limits a little bit and that this is where he was actually buried. Then I headed to my next destination, which this is one of those times where you look at your phone and you think it's going to be later than it actually is because I think it was only like 10 o'clock at this time. And I was like, it feels like it should be like 5 o'clock in the evening. But I was like, oh, I forgot. I woke up at like 3 o'clock this morning. The only enjoyable thing about this walk was that it was all downhill because if I had to walk this uphill, I would even call the plate even going to this next destination. I probably would have gone eventually. I would just be complaining the whole time. But this is one of the only times the walk was actually enjoyable. So this is the tomb of the Virgin Mary, Mother of Jesus. And this was one of my favorite places to come. You had to go down all these stairs and the temperature dropped significantly. I was stunned. And the main hall was stunning. I loved all these chandeliers and candles and lights. I loved all of it. It was so beautiful, especially the art on the wall too. And another sultras where it is believed that Mary is buried. And as you can see, people give her offerings and prayers and she's really highly revered in the Catholic tradition. So a lot of people make pilgrimage here to pay her their respects to the Mary Mother of Jesus. And then I took a taxi back because I gagged up the thought of walking up that hill again. I'm sure you're lucky for more. This is my last travel vlog from this trip. I loved going to Israel and Palestine. It was just an amazing experience. Let me know in the comments what y'all want to see. If you'll want to see tips and tricks for going to Israel and Palestine.

Now there's a long-standing arrangement about who can access the site and what they can do. If you've heard of status quo, that's essentially what we're talking about. And it's basically this. Now, who actually controls who visits and who prays? Well, in theory, it's an Islamic trust known as the Wakaaf, but Israeli forces control many of the gates and the security outside the compound, because Easter-Russelam is under a military occupation by Israel. And this is where all the issues come up because Israeli forces are increasingly taking control of what goes on inside the compound, like restricting Muslims, especially Palestinians from entering, and turning a blind eye to Jews openly praying there. This year a lot of people were angry when Israel's new interior minister Ben Gavir went, and it was seen as a very provocative move. So here's the thing. You've got this really holy place, thousands of years of history, and what's supposed to be an established way of doing things, but it's changing, because we're seeing two trends play out there. One, there's the growing power of the far right in Israel, people who say Jews should be able to pray at the compound, and that it should be under Israeli control. And two, Palestinians living under Israeli occupation are increasingly seeing their rights, their land, and identity being erased. And when that happens at Al-Aqsa, they really see it as a final straw. By the way, we do these explainers about news topics all the time on my show start here.

The significance of the wall is that it's the only remaining piece from the second temple of Jerusalem built over 2,000 years ago. The original temple was destroyed in 70 AD by the Romans, and all the Jewish people were exiled from the city. When they returned later on, the only remaining wall became a site of pilgrimage. It was where the Jewish people came to lament their tragic losses at the hands of the Romans, which is where it caught the name the wailing wall. The wall is immense, built of thick limestone 60 feet tall, but not everyone is convinced that the wall really was part of the temple. It's disputed with devout Jews believing it to be real, and many Arabs arguing the walls actually belong to a mosque called Al-Aqsa, a mystery year is that no one can definitively say what structure the wall belonged to.",subjective

Israel knows today and the world should know now. The reason the Oslo Accords failed is because a Palestinian's never wanted to have a state next to Israel. They want to have a state from the river to the sea. So the two cities should be safe. Here I'm going to show you why Palestine has never turned down a two state because they've never been offered a two state. These are all the ones that I'm going to go through and I'm going to do it fast. Let's start at the very beginning. The Ottoman Empire fell. The British took over. They decided the Palestinians were too savage so they took control. Balfour came in and said, hey, this should be for the Jews. But no one was happy about the Brits being in control. So the UN came in and made a little partition plan. They gave the best parts of the land. They gave 55% of the land to 24% of the population. And just 44% of the land to 76% of the population. Yeah, and they also gave them the most shitty parts. So of course, no one was happy. There was a big war that broke out. Other Arab countries came in. Israel came on on top. And in the end, controlled 78% of the land would actually ended the war, the armistice agreements. No, Palestinian wasn't allowed a seat at the table and did not address the Palestinians right to return or a statehood. Camp David Accords. Nope, Palestinians not allowed to speak just yet. It talked about a future, maybe state sometime. Let's talk about it. Nothing was ever resolved. The majority conference in 1991. For the first time in over 40 years, the Palestinians were allowed a seat at the table. But only with their little co-sponsor, Jordan. This conference did not address settlements, the right of statehood, the right of return, or anything that really mattered. The Oslo Accords. Here's what came out of that. The Palestinian Authority and the division of the West Bank into three areas, A, B, and C. The PA was now allowed to control 30% of the West Bank, but only like Sorta. Because Israel could come in at any point in time, they felt like it under security concerns and arrest, kill, and demolish. The right of return, the right of a state, the growing settlement issue never resolved. The Y River Memorandum was supposed to result in Israel pulling out of the West Bank, partially. Did they honor this? No. Camp David Summit was supposed to be the final agreement. Did not address a statehood, sovereignty, the right of return, the settlements, and the growing refugee crisis. Road map for peace. The goal was a two-state solution. It failed. It did not freeze illegal settlement activity nor improve Palestinian governance. Because like I said, the PA had authority. Israel walked all over it. An Appleist conference did not resolve any issues. Did not offer Palestinians a state nor resolve any core issues like the right of return or the settlements. Carry-led negotiations. Same fucking thing. Nothing was resolved. No right to return. No settlement issue. No state. Since 2014, fucking nothing's been done. So don't come at me.

Israel knows today and the world should know now. The reason the Oslo Accords failed is because a Palestinian's never wanted to have a state next to Israel.

Here I'm going to show you why Palestine has never turned down a two state because they've never been offered a two state. These are all the ones that I'm going to go through and I'm going to do it fast. Let's start at the very beginning. The Ottoman Empire fell. The British took over. They decided the Palestinians were too savage so they took control. Balfour came in and said, hey, this should be for the Jews. But no one was happy about the Brits being in control. So the UN came in and made a little partition plan. They gave the best parts of the land. They gave 55% of the land to 24% of the population. And just 44% of the land to 76% of the population. Yeah, and they also gave them the most shitty parts. So of course, no one was happy. There was a big war that broke out. Other Arab countries came in. Israel came on on top. And in the end, controlled 78% of the land would actually ended the war, the armistice agreements. No, Palestinian wasn't allowed a seat at the table and did not address the Palestinians right to return or a statehood. Camp David Accords. Nope, Palestinians not allowed to speak just yet. It talked about a future, maybe state sometime. Let's talk about it. Nothing was ever resolved. The majority conference in 1991. For the first time in over 40 years, the Palestinians were allowed a seat at the table. But only with their little co-sponsor, Jordan. This conference did not address settlements, the right of statehood, the right of return, or anything that really mattered. The Oslo Accords. Here's what came out of that. The Palestinian Authority and the division of the West Bank into three areas, A, B, and C. The PA was now allowed to control 30% of the West Bank, but only like Sorta. Because Israel could come in at any point in time, they felt like it under security concerns and arrest, kill, and demolish. The right of return, the right of a state, the growing settlement issue never resolved. The Y River Memorandum was supposed to result in Israel pulling out of the West Bank, partially. Did they honor this? No. Camp David Summit was supposed to be the final agreement. Did not address a statehood, sovereignty, the right of return, the settlements, and the growing refugee crisis. Road map for peace. The goal was a two-state solution. It failed. It did not freeze illegal settlement activity nor improve Palestinian governance. Because like I said, the PA had authority. Israel walked all over it. An Appleist conference did not resolve any issues. Did not offer Palestinians a state nor resolve any core issues like the right of return or the settlements. Carry-led negotiations. Same fucking thing. Nothing was resolved. No right to return. No settlement issue. No state. Since 2014, fucking nothing's been done. So don't come at me.

Essentially Israel is right to exist. It was also established as a political organization 1897. Some interpret Zionism as being synonymous with the occupation of Palestinian land. Hamas is the Palestinian militant group that attacked and is really music festival on October 7th killing more than 1200. The group has no official links to ISIS. The video has since been deleted from his account, but commenters immediately took to Twitter, Reddit, and Schnaps the latest Instagram post to discuss the stickers. Many saw the video just trivializing the situation in Gaza where more than 11,000 people have been killed. Schnaps has also recently been criticized for allegedly liking a post which mocked Palestinians. Some are calling for a boycott of the upcoming Stranger Things Final Susan, which Schnaps stars in, or for him to be recast.

Can you guess which two? I came across this headline talking about one of the stranger things cast members being fired or essentially not coming back for the new season. Being the curious little girl that I am, I open the comments to a flood of people saying if it's not Noah, I'm not watching. So I'm thinking either that's Doja Cat on thousands of different spam accounts or Coke in a head was back on his snickshit and did something that pissed a lot of people off. And boy, did he. So it all started when Noah shared this video of him and his friends looking happier than little kids and chucky cheese over these Zionism is sexy stickers. And to really put into perspective just how much Noah's posts affected people, fake reports of him getting into a bike accident were published all over the internet. And let's just say comments ranged from I hope the bikes okay. All the way to I hope he's paralyzed now. So in the court of public opinion, things weren't looking good for good old Noah's snap. By the time the announcement came that the new season was filming, we conveniently get an apology video that reeks of PR and Netflix are making me do this because all of you guys said you're not going to watch the news season of my TV show if I don't. I've had many open discussions with friends from Palestine, Stinion background. See guys, even though he thinks that Zionism is in fact sexy, he's not a Zionist because he has Palestinian friends. He also says something in that apology video like I just feel like my opinions don't really, you know, reflect my opinions. The girl I don't know, listen, he did that thing where he released that video at like two o'clock in the morning hoping everybody would just not see it. Maybe that's not how this app works. That was the first video that this app showed me right off the bat when I opened it the following day. Like that's like, that's like weasel shit. And a real kicker is that he was in this movie called Abe in 2019, a 12 year old boy who dreams of being a cook tries to find the ideal recipe to break down the cultural barriers that divide his half Israeli and half Palestinian family. But Noah is not actually the only person on the Stranger Things cast coming back for season five that is vocally a Zionist. In fact, the Baldy appear is maybe a billion times worse when it comes to their posts. I'm not even remotely exaggerating when I say every single post on this man's channel, all of his tweets are about Israel and they are so aggressive I would even categorize them is just straight propaganda. Which of course I guess is to be expected when you are a self-proclaimed Zionist pig. So really nobody is surprised that he said Noah Schnapp shouldn't have apologized and had nothing to apologize for. But remember we're talking about who got fired and who didn't and why. So let's go ahead and take a look at whatever the fuck his name's posts. He has a going Gen Z and all you other fake woke liberals. Here's a little something for you. You don't read. Very thankful to influencers like the Hattie and Sisters who keep spreading the same misinformation to their millions of pumbillions of followers. Why are you doing that? You have fake progressives? I'll tell you why. Yeah? Hey. What should I do with my silent fake woke liberal non-Jewish friends? Hey fake woke Americans? Guess who actually lives on stolen land? You do. From the river to the sea. That means you want to come here. So just to recap both of these men are still very much employed by the Duffer Brothers and Netflix and will very much be in the final season of Stranger Things. And not only are Netflix and the Duffer Brothers naning by them, so are Daystreetbooks aka HarperCollins. But you know who did get fired for posting about Palestine? A Latina non-binary person in woman. Seriously Sarah Ramirez just got let go from it just like that. Stating that it was allegedly because of their support for Palestine. And Melissa Barera got fired from Screen 7 after simply saying, I too come from a colonized country, Palestine will be free. They tried to bury us. They didn't know we were seeds. Which is somehow according to the people that fired her, not only anti-semitism, but also an incitement of hate, including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, holocaust distortion, and something that flagrantly crossed the line into hate speech. Cook, cook, cook, cook, so one of these things is not like the other. And just to have a real full circle moment here, remember the person that they were talking about got fired from the final season? It was Eduardo Franco who played Argyle. Argyle was only a fan favorite and you know Eduardo was probably one of the most unproblematic celebrities I've ever seen. But yeah, I couldn't possibly figure out what sets him apart from these two gentlemen. Maybe these two gentlemen could explain to us. because I'd love to hear somebody say it out loud. Anyway, guess I'll never know what happens to the gang because I'm not watching this shit. Or this! And this one's honestly been on thin ice ever since they kept employing Bobby Lee after that disgusting Jokey told about Grape being a child. Should I make another video on that? I feel like not enough people know about that. Okay, love you, bye.",subjective

Can you guess which two? I came across this headline talking about one of the stranger things cast members being fired or essentially not coming back for the new season. Being the curious little girl that I am, I open the comments to a flood of people saying if it's not Noah, I'm not watching. So I'm thinking either that's Doja Cat on thousands of different spam accounts or Coke in a head was back on his snickshit and did something that pissed a lot of people off. And boy, did he. So it all started when Noah shared this video of him and his friends looking happier than little kids and chucky cheese over these Zionism is sexy stickers. And to really put into perspective just how much Noah's posts affected people, fake reports of him getting into a bike accident were published all over the internet. And let's just say comments ranged from I hope the bikes okay. All the way to I hope he's paralyzed now. So in the court of public opinion, things weren't looking good for good old Noah's snap. By the time the announcement came that the new season was filming, we conveniently get an apology video that reeks of PR and Netflix are making me do this because all of you guys said you're not going to watch the news season of my TV show if I don't. I've had many open discussions with friends from Palestine, Stinion background. See guys, even though he thinks that Zionism is in fact sexy, he's not a Zionist because he has Palestinian friends. He also says something in that apology video like I just feel like my opinions don't really, you know, reflect my opinions. The girl I don't know, listen, he did that thing where he released that video at like two o'clock in the morning hoping everybody would just not see it. Maybe that's not how this app works. That was the first video that this app showed me right off the bat when I opened it the following day. Like that's like, that's like weasel shit. And a real kicker is that he was in this movie called Abe in 2019, a 12 year old boy who dreams of being a cook tries to find the ideal recipe to break down the cultural barriers that divide his half Israeli and half Palestinian family. But Noah is not actually the only person on the Stranger Things cast coming back for season five that is vocally a Zionist. In fact, the Baldy appear is maybe a billion times worse when it comes to their posts. I'm not even remotely exaggerating when I say every single post on this man's channel, all of his tweets are about Israel and they are so aggressive I would even categorize them is just straight propaganda. Which of course I guess is to be expected when you are a self-proclaimed Zionist pig. So really nobody is surprised that he said Noah Schnapp shouldn't have apologized and had nothing to apologize for. But remember we're talking about who got fired and who didn't and why. So let's go ahead and take a look at whatever the fuck his name's posts. He has a going Gen Z and all you other fake woke liberals. Here's a little something for you. You don't read. Very thankful to influencers like the Hattie and Sisters who keep spreading the same misinformation to their millions of pumbillions of followers. Why are you doing that? You have fake progressives? I'll tell you why. Yeah? Hey. What should I do with my silent fake woke liberal non-Jewish friends? Hey fake woke Americans? Guess who actually lives on stolen land? You do. From the river to the sea. That means you want to come here. So just to recap both of these men are still very much employed by the Duffer Brothers and Netflix and will very much be in the final season of Stranger Things. And not only are Netflix and the Duffer Brothers naning by them, so are Daystreetbooks aka HarperCollins. But you know who did get fired for posting about Palestine? A Latina non-binary person in woman. Seriously Sarah Ramirez just got let go from it just like that. Stating that it was allegedly because of their support for Palestine. And Melissa Barera got fired from Screen 7 after simply saying, I too come from a colonized country, Palestine will be free. They tried to bury us. They didn't know we were seeds. Which is somehow according to the people that fired her, not only anti-semitism, but also an incitement of hate, including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, holocaust distortion, and something that flagrantly crossed the line into hate speech. Cook, cook, cook, cook, so one of these things is not like the other. And just to have a real full circle moment here, remember the person that they were talking about got fired from the final season? It was Eduardo Franco who played Argyle. Argyle was only a fan favorite and you know Eduardo was probably one of the most unproblematic celebrities I've ever seen. But yeah, I couldn't possibly figure out what sets him apart from these two gentlemen. Maybe these two gentlemen could explain to us. because I'd love to hear somebody say it out loud. Anyway, guess I'll never know what happens to the gang because I'm not watching this shit. Or this! And this one's honestly been on thin ice ever since they kept employing Bobby Lee after that disgusting Jokey told about Grape being a child. Should I make another video on that? I feel like not enough people know about that. Okay, love you, bye.",subjective

And Lloyd George was the main instigator of that declaration because he believed that it would serve Britain's interests. But this was also the first time that any major European power had given official backing for the Zionist goal of making Palestine into a Jewish homeland. Yet Sheriff Hussain had understood that Palestine had been promised as part of his deal for Arab independence. Anticipating Arab outrage at the prospect of a Jewish homeland in a largely Arab province, the Balfour Declaration had also stated that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine. The Declaration, nonetheless, appeared to indicate British support for Jewish immigration. There were only a mere 80,000 out of some like 700,000 people in Palestine who were Jews, the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine were referred to as non-Jewish inhabitants. And that Palestine was being identified even at that stage as a Jewish land. And all the others had no defined identity. They were simply non-Jewish. The Balfour Declaration was what it says, a declaration. It wasn't a treaty. It wasn't a signed agreement. It was a declaration in support of the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine.",subjective

The Balfour Declaration, the expression of the British government support for a Jewish home in Palestine, was sent by British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to the Second Law Dross Child. I'm here in Buckinghamshire at Waddistan Manor to speak with the fourth Law Dross Child about the Balfour Declaration, what it means for Britain, for the Jewish people and the Roth Child family. The Foreign Office November 2, 1917. Dear Lord Roth Child, I have much pleasure in conveying to you on behalf of his Majesty's government the following Declaration of Sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations which has been submitted to and approved by the Cabinet. So it's possibly the most famous letter in modern Jewish history and it begins with three words, Dear Lord Roth Child, why was it that this letter was sent by the Foreign Secretary to your great Uncle Walter? It's an interesting question because he was ready and said non-ethology although he became an student's artist and I think the reason was this that it was primarily a movement from Eastern Europe. But they didn't clarify who was in charge of that movement and in addition it was our shorting Great Britain. So they felt that the Roth Child family should be the one to whom it was addressed and Walter was Lord Roth Child and he was as honest and there's really other background reasons. So Walter received the Balfour Declaration and I have a copy here and I wonder if I could possibly ask you to read it for us. Yes indeed. I'm going to put on spectacles to make sure I'm read it accurately. His Majesty's government, deal with favor, the establishment of Palestine, of a national home for the Jewish people and reduce their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of the Jewish people. It's been clearly understood that nothing should be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of the existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights and political status and drive by Jews in any other country. I should be grateful if you would bring this declaration to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation, Yours Arthur Balfour. And here it is, the Balfour Declaration. What do you feel when you see it here? I've genuinely felt it's one of the most extraordinary moments in the history of the Jewish people. If you think it took 3,000 years to get to this. And of course the Roth Child family then has now filled two roles because it wasn't just a leader of diaspora jury. It also played a very significant role in the early years of the establishment of the Pioneer communities in Israel as well. I just want to revisit for a moment your cousin Dorothy, who you mentioned, who at an extraordinarily young age, still in her teens played such a critical role as a go-between and a facilitator for Chiam Weitzman. Can you say a little bit about that? My cousin Jimmy went to 17. So this is your cousin Dorothy, Dolly? Yes, Mrs. James Arastrao. And from her teenage years onwards she was a major supporter of Israel. Major supporter? I mean she worships her husband who had been deeply committed, son of Baron Edmall. It was due to him I think she became interested but once she became interested she became passionately interested. After his death she became even more committed. She just wanted to carry out his wishes and what he thought deeply about. And you can read letters from her advice from him, from writes to her when she was on his 17. And what she did, which is crucial important, was to connect up Weitzman with a British establishment. I think she also trained him in how to deal. She helped educate to how to conduct that age. But she did tell Weitzman in a how to come into great, I don't serve myself into British establishment life, which you learned very quickly. So I'm here in the Wadaston Manor Archives where there is a treasure trove of remarkable documents from the time of the Balfour Declaration. We have the correspondence here between the teenage Dorothy and her husband James. And it's really a love story. Here we have detailed letters describing her dealings with Zionist leaders, her advice and her suggestions regarding the conferences of the Zionist movement. And here we have a letter that the young Dorothy still not 20, sent to Dr. Chaim Weitzman where she's talking about the meetings that she's arranged for him. And as we've heard, she was helpful in training and preparing him to enter into the highest echelons of British society to advance the cause of the Zionist movement.",subjective

In 1917, the British government, hoping to gain the support of Jewish people, issued the Balfour Declaration, promising, quote, the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people. A bold promise considering that Palestine was still technically Ottoman as they hadn't yet lost World War I. Of course, they would soon, but it turned out that the British were over-promissers when it came to Palestine, because a year before the Balfour Declaration, the British had secretly promised the French that they would divide up the Arab territories and the Brits would keep Palestine. Furthermore, in 1915, other British officials had promised the ruler of Mecca, Sharif Hussein, that he would rule over an Arab state, including Palestine, if he let an Arab revolt against Ottoman rule, which Hussein promptly did. So basically, the Brits had promised Palestine to the Meccans, to themselves, and to the Zionists.

Palestine action who posted the video to Instagram wrote a caption stating written in 1917 Balfour's Declaration began the ethnic cleansing of Palestine by promising the land away which the British never had the right to do. After the declaration until 1948, the British burnt down indigenous villages to prepare the way with this came arbitrary killings, a rest, torture, and sexual violence, including our word. The British paved the way for the Neckba and trained the Zionist militia to ethnically cleanse over 750,000 Palestinians, destroy over 500 villages, and massacre many families. The Neckba never stopped and the genocide today is rooted and supported by British complicity.

I've genuinely felt it's one of the most extraordinary moments in the history of the Jewish people. I think it took 3,000 years to get to this. And then you say, how did this miracle happen? It was the most incredible piece of opportunism. I mean, if you think you had an impoverished would-be scientist time vites for somehow gets to England. Meet the few people, including my family, seduces them, he had such great charm and conviction. He gets to Balfour and unbelievably persuades Balfour and Lloyd George, the Prime Minister, and most of the ministers, that this idea of the national home for Jews should be allowed to take place. I mean, it's so, so unlikely. And then he starts to fight a difficult battle with the British cabinet, and that goes through five drafts, as you know. And in the end, it comes out as a rather compromising letter. I mean, the essential point is there for the Jewish community to fasten onto. You have the first bit, which promises a national home, rather than the national home, and then you have the bit that nothing that's to be done should, in any way, harm the Arab community. But you come back to the big point, which is that this is perhaps the greatest event in Jewish life, the thousands of years. And it's a miracle.",subjective

Yet Sheriff Hussain had understood that Palestine had been promised as part of his deal for Arab independence. Anticipating Arab outrage at the prospect of a Jewish homeland in a largely Arab province, the Balfour Declaration had also stated that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine. The Declaration, nonetheless, appeared to indicate British support for Jewish immigration. There were only a mere 80,000 out of some like 700,000 people in Palestine who were Jews, the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine were referred to as non-Jewish inhabitants. And that Palestine was being identified even at that stage as a Jewish land. And all the others had no defined identity. They were simply non-Jewish.

And of course the Roth Child family then has now filled two roles because it wasn't just a leader of diaspora jury. It also played a very significant role in the early years of the establishment of the Pioneer communities in Israel as well. I just want to revisit for a moment your cousin Dorothy, who you mentioned, who at an extraordinarily young age, still in her teens played such a critical role as a go-between and a facilitator for Chiam Weitzman. Can you say a little bit about that? My cousin Jimmy went to 17. So this is your cousin Dorothy, Dolly? Yes, Mrs. James Arastrao. And from her teenage years onwards she was a major supporter of Israel. Major supporter? I mean she worships her husband who had been deeply committed, son of Baron Edmall. It was due to him I think she became interested but once she became interested she became passionately interested. After his death she became even more committed. She just wanted to carry out his wishes and what he thought deeply about. And you can read letters from her advice from him, from writes to her when she was on his 17. And what she did, which is crucial important, was to connect up Weitzman with a British establishment. I think she also trained him in how to deal. She helped educate to how to conduct that age. But she did tell Weitzman in a how to come into great, I don't serve myself into British establishment life, which you learned very quickly. So I'm here in the Wadaston Manor Archives where there is a treasure trove of remarkable documents from the time of the Balfour Declaration. We have the correspondence here between the teenage Dorothy and her husband James. And it's really a love story. Here we have detailed letters describing her dealings with Zionist leaders, her advice and her suggestions regarding the conferences of the Zionist movement. And here we have a letter that the young Dorothy still not 20, sent to Dr. Chaim Weitzman where she's talking about the meetings that she's arranged for him. And as we've heard, she was helpful in training and preparing him to enter into the highest echelons of British society to advance the cause of the Zionist movement.",subjective

In 1917, the British government, hoping to gain the support of Jewish people, issued the Balfour Declaration, promising, quote, the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people. A bold promise considering that Palestine was still technically Ottoman as they hadn't yet lost World War I. Of course, they would soon, but it turned out that the British were over-promissers when it came to Palestine, because a year before the Balfour Declaration, the British had secretly promised the French that they would divide up the Arab territories and the Brits would keep Palestine. Furthermore, in 1915, other British officials had promised the ruler of Mecca, Sharif Hussein, that he would rule over an Arab state, including Palestine, if he let an Arab revolt against Ottoman rule, which Hussein promptly did. So basically, the Brits had promised Palestine to the Meccans, to themselves, and to the Zionists.

Dear Lord Rothschild, I have much pleasure in conveying to you on behalf of his majesty's government the following declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations which has been submitted to and approved by the cabinet. Why was it that this letter was sent by the Foreign Secretary to your great Uncle Walter? It's an interesting question because it was primarily a movement from Eastern Europe. But they didn't clarify who was in charge of that movement and in addition it was our strong in Great Britain. So they felt that the Rothschild family should be the one to whom it was addressed and Walter was Lord Rothschild and he was, as honest, and those really are the background reasons. So Walter received the Balfour Declaration and I have a copy here and I wonder if I could possibly ask you to read it for us? Yes indeed. I'm going to put on spectacles to make sure I'm read it accurately. His majesty's government, deal with favor, the establishment of Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and reduce their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object. It being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews and any other country. I should be grateful if he would bring this declaration to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation, the author Balfour. And here it is, the Balfour Declaration. What do you feel when you see it here? I've genuinely felt it's one of the most extraordinary moments in the history of the Jewish people. I think it took 3,000 years to get to this. And then you say, how did this miracle happen? It was the most incredible piece of opportunism. I mean, if you think you had an impoverished would-be scientist time vites for somehow gets to England. Meet the few people, including my family, seduces them, he had such great charm and conviction. He gets to Balfour and unbelievably persuades Balfour and Lloyd George, the Prime Minister, and most of the ministers, that this idea of the national home for Jews should be allowed to take place. I mean, it's so, so unlikely. And then he starts to fight a difficult battle with the British cabinet, and that goes through five drafts, as you know. And in the end, it comes out as a rather compromising letter. I mean, the essential point is there for the Jewish community to fasten onto. You have the first bit, which promises a national home, rather than the national home, and then you have the bit that nothing that's to be done should, in any way, harm the Arab community. But you come back to the big point, which is that this is perhaps the greatest event in Jewish life, the thousands of years. And it's a miracle.",subjective

So it's been 106 years because it was November 2nd 1917 when it came out. Arthur James Balfour was the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and he's the one who wrote this declaration which is a single sentence 67 words and it basically promised the Lannapalist under the time to the Zionist movement to build a home for the Jewish population at the time. With the full backing of the British government. This is what it says, pause to read, pay attention to this part. On the surface the language seems kind of like the Netherlands, almost towards who Arthur James Balfour called the existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine. But as the author points out they were described in terms what they were not and certainly not as a nation or a people. The words Palestinian and Arab do not appear into 67 words of the declaration. By way of contrast Balfour ascribed national rights to what he called the Jewish people who at the time were only 6% of the countries and avatents. So the British didn't intend any good will at all towards the Palestinian people at the time. And how do we know that? Well in 1919 Balfour wrote a memo which was on earth 30 years afterwards and in it he wrote this, for in Palestine we do not propose even to go through the form of consulting the wishes of the present inhabitants of the country. The four great powers are committed to Zionism and Zionism be it right or wrong good or bad is rooted into aged long traditions and present needs in future homes of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit the ancient land. In my opinion that is right. And of the very ancestors in short so far as Palestine is concerned the powers have made no statement of fact which is not admittedly wrong and no declaration of policy which at least in the letter they have not always intended to violate. And that's how the immigration of European Jewish settlers began to back by British monies and by large purchases of land they were able to oust the inhabitants and the peasants that were living in Palestine to make way for the Zionist state. So if that doesn't tell you everything you need to know about colonialist thinking and if that's who the early Zionist movement aligned themselves with after not being an everybody else's door because at first they tried to align themselves with the Ottoman Empire than to try to align themselves with Germany but it was the British who led by their own weirdly Christian-y kind of worldview decided to sponsor the colonialist project of Zionism. Because in their mind they were like the good guys because they're ushering in the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies etc. Once again Christianity is very worse this page continues to bang that gong. So yeah just crazy how hundred and six years ago the destinies of millions of people was forever altered even to the point of what you're seeing in today's news and social media and the horrible horrible atrocities are being committed this has long reaching effects for the rest of all of the area to this day. Do not support anyone who backs this crazy colonialist thinking even if they dressed it up a modern day talk. It doesn't matter if it's from the right or from the left. This is wrong and it needs to stop ceasefire for a guys up now.",subjective

White people took brown people's land and felt they had the right to kick out the people, take the land do what they wanted with it and this was the same idea and this was the idea upon which Zionism was built. Basically a racist colonialist idea. Then several decades later we had the United Nations partition plan. The United Nations felt that they could partition Palestine and give a portion of it to the Jewish people. Accepting this very strange idea that Jews are a people as opposed to a religion. That's a whole other issue. And you have to wonder what kind of a crazy idea is that. Who in the right mind would agree that the United Nations or anyone for that matter would take their country and give the larger portion of it to a community of immigrants who had just arrived basically.

And I've never really talked about that in a video, so today I thought I would make a video about perhaps the most important piece of paper that saved the Zionist project and also empowered it to do what it has done to this day. And this was the Balfour Declaration. If you're wondering what the Balfour Declaration is, this is exactly what it is. It is a communication between the Foreign Secretary, Lord Arthur Balfour and the most powerful Jewish person in the whole of England, Lord Rothschild. Now, the Balfour Declaration was effectively the British's declaration that it would support a Jewish National Home in Palestine. Now, as an anti-Semitic nation, it may seem very bizarre that Britain did this. However, there were a couple of reasons for it. People like Winston Churchill at this time thoroughly believed that the settlement of Palestine could constitute an alternative to Jewish people partaking in the Russian Revolution and joining the Bolsheviks because if Winston Churchill hated one group the most, it was the Bolsheviks. Now, the other reason is a man named Kine Weitzmann. There are many figures who played significant roles in the early Zionist project. You have Theodore Herzl, who wrote a Judenstart, a massive figure for the establishment of the Jewish state in Palestine. You have David Pengurion, who I'll talk about later in this video, Bell Katz Nelson. But Kine Weitzmann is the one who saved the Zionist project. Kine Weitzmann was a British chemist and what he did was he invented the acetone process to enable mass production of explosives for artillery shells. This meant that the British loved him and he was able to get concessions from the British because of the importance of this for the First World War. The Zionist project was really struggling at this point. Many of the early settlers who had come to Palestine had given up, things like malaria affected them heavily and also the arduous nature of the task that they were doing. It was very common for people to just return to where they'd come from. And also in 1914, the Ottomans had discovered that the Zionists were planning to build their own state. And because of this, Jamal Pasha, one of the military leaders of the Ottoman Empire during the First World War, disarmed the Jewish people and ordered all non-Jewish citizens deported on December 17, 1914. Now, Ben Gurion moved to America and he was going round cities in America trying to get Jewish people to join his project. However, he was only able to get less than 100. This shows you how dire the situation was for the Zionist project. They were really struggling and then the Bolshevik revolution happened and his hopes hit their lowest point. You can literally see this in the number of people who began to support David Ben Gurion after he was celebrating the Balfour Declaration, not the Cooper Union Hall in New York. 2,000 people pledged that they would devote their energy to building a national home in Palestine. And he launched another fundraising tour and found 1,500 more volunteers. This is incredible. In comparison to struggling to find 100 people, all of a sudden, this Balfour Declaration had changed the fate of the Zionist project and would define its success in the future. Convitesman may have saved the project but Ben Gurion was the one who made the state. He was the one who was massively focused and fought against Marxist constantly who were trying to build a society in Palestine where Arab and Jewish workers would work together. He said that this should not happen and there should be an exclusivist Jewish Labour society because it would be able to create a higher wage exclusionary society that would mean that Jewish immigrants were more attracted to come to Palestine. And also he banned the speaking of any language that was not Hebrew because as a deasphoric people it was much more likely that Jewish people would actually speak Yiddish as opposed to Hebrew. Now let's quickly go back to the Balfour Declaration. Many of you will know exactly what the problem I'm about to bring up is nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine. Here is the crux of the issue of the Balfour Declaration. It was totally farcical to believe that what the Zionist project wanted to do was not going to harm the people who already existed within Palestine. One example of the early segregationist policies that really upset and disenfranchised Arab peasant workers within the land was that the Zionist project would buy land within Palestine. They never got that much only between 2 and 5%. But what they would do is they would expel the Palestinians off that land, they would never allow them to work on it again and they also ban the sale of it to other Arab people ever again. And also the King Crane Commission which was organized by Woodrow Wilson and was sent to do fact finding in Palestine in 1919 highlighted that establishing a Jewish state cannot be accomplished without the gravestress passes upon the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine. This is the crux of the issue in Palestine. You cannot argue that the Palestinian people just hate Jewish people and that they didn't ever want to establish something with them. There were many people in this early period including some of the settlers who were coming who thought that they should build a society that should work together. However, thanks to British support, the skill of David Bengurion, it ultimately ended with a society that was always based on the exclusion, subjugation of the Palestinian people.",subjective

Anticipating Arab outrage at the prospect of a Jewish homeland in a largely Arab province, the Balfour Declaration had also stated that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine. The Declaration, nonetheless, appeared to indicate British support for Jewish immigration. There were only a mere 80,000 out of some like 700,000 people in Palestine who were Jews, the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine were referred to as non-Jewish inhabitants. And that Palestine was being identified even at that stage as a Jewish land. And all the others had no defined identity. They were simply non-Jewish.

The Balfour Declaration, the expression of the British government support for a Jewish home in Palestine, was sent by British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to the Second Law Dross Child. I'm here in Buckinghamshire at Waddistan Manor to speak with the fourth Law Dross Child about the Balfour Declaration, what it means for Britain, for the Jewish people and the Roth Child family. The Foreign Office November 2, 1917. Dear Lord Roth Child, I have much pleasure in conveying to you on behalf of his Majesty's government the following Declaration of Sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations which has been submitted to and approved by the Cabinet. So it's possibly the most famous letter in modern Jewish history and it begins with three words, Dear Lord Roth Child, why was it that this letter was sent by the Foreign Secretary to your great Uncle Walter? It's an interesting question because he was ready and said non-ethology although he became an student's artist and I think the reason was this that it was primarily a movement from Eastern Europe. But they didn't clarify who was in charge of that movement and in addition it was our shorting Great Britain. So they felt that the Roth Child family should be the one to whom it was addressed and Walter was Lord Roth Child and he was as honest and there's really other background reasons. So Walter received the Balfour Declaration and I have a copy here and I wonder if I could possibly ask you to read it for us. Yes indeed. I'm going to put on spectacles to make sure I'm read it accurately. His Majesty's government, deal with favor, the establishment of Palestine, of a national home for the Jewish people and reduce their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of the Jewish people. It's been clearly understood that nothing should be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of the existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights and political status and drive by Jews in any other country. I should be grateful if you would bring this declaration to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation, Yours Arthur Balfour. And here it is, the Balfour Declaration. What do you feel when you see it here? I've genuinely felt it's one of the most extraordinary moments in the history of the Jewish people. If you think it took 3,000 years to get to this. And of course the Roth Child family then has now filled two roles because it wasn't just a leader of diaspora jury. It also played a very significant role in the early years of the establishment of the Pioneer communities in Israel as well. I just want to revisit for a moment your cousin Dorothy, who you mentioned, who at an extraordinarily young age, still in her teens played such a critical role as a go-between and a facilitator for Chiam Weitzman. Can you say a little bit about that? My cousin Jimmy went to 17. So this is your cousin Dorothy, Dolly? Yes, Mrs. James Arastrao. And from her teenage years onwards she was a major supporter of Israel. Major supporter? I mean she worships her husband who had been deeply committed, son of Baron Edmall. It was due to him I think she became interested but once she became interested she became passionately interested. After his death she became even more committed. She just wanted to carry out his wishes and what he thought deeply about. And you can read letters from her advice from him, from writes to her when she was on his 17. And what she did, which is crucial important, was to connect up Weitzman with a British establishment. I think she also trained him in how to deal. She helped educate to how to conduct that age. But she did tell Weitzman in a how to come into great, I don't serve myself into British establishment life, which you learned very quickly. So I'm here in the Wadaston Manor Archives where there is a treasure trove of remarkable documents from the time of the Balfour Declaration. We have the correspondence here between the teenage Dorothy and her husband James. And it's really a love story. Here we have detailed letters describing her dealings with Zionist leaders, her advice and her suggestions regarding the conferences of the Zionist movement. And here we have a letter that the young Dorothy still not 20, sent to Dr. Chaim Weitzman where she's talking about the meetings that she's arranged for him. And as we've heard, she was helpful in training and preparing him to enter into the highest echelons of British society to advance the cause of the Zionist movement.",subjective

In 1917, the British government, hoping to gain the support of Jewish people, issued the Balfour Declaration, promising, quote, the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people. A bold promise considering that Palestine was still technically Ottoman as they hadn't yet lost World War I. Of course, they would soon, but it turned out that the British were over-promissers when it came to Palestine, because a year before the Balfour Declaration, the British had secretly promised the French that they would divide up the Arab territories and the Brits would keep Palestine. Furthermore, in 1915, other British officials had promised the ruler of Mecca, Sharif Hussein, that he would rule over an Arab state, including Palestine, if he let an Arab revolt against Ottoman rule, which Hussein promptly did. So basically, the Brits had promised Palestine to the Meccans, to themselves, and to the Zionists.

If someone could just like answer that for me really quick, that would be great But we're gonna look into this right now. So this was a public statement issued by the British government in 1917 during the first world war in which it announced its support for a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine Okay, the declaration contained a letter from this guy as well as that guy That guy so the more that I'm reading up on this the more that I'm realizing that what was written and what actually happened Are not the same thing and of course the US government had a lot to do with it Everyone wants to say that Obama was the one that made propaganda legal, but really we've been doing it for a very long time So the US approach this entire issue was hampered by the general absence of specialist knowledge about the region and The reports on Palestine were deeply flawed as they are now nothing has changed Not only that, but in typical US fashion we pre-supposed a particular outcome of the conflict Okay, it just keeps getting worse. We made an equal pledge that we would not turn the Arab office land or invade its political and social rights What and it took what 20 years for one of the most traumatic events in Palestinian history to occur after pledging that that wouldn't happen Why do we think that we're on the right side?

Dear Lord Rothschild, I have much pleasure in conveying to you on behalf of his majesty's government the following declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations which has been submitted to and approved by the cabinet. Why was it that this letter was sent by the Foreign Secretary to your great Uncle Walter? It's an interesting question because it was primarily a movement from Eastern Europe. But they didn't clarify who was in charge of that movement and in addition it was our strong in Great Britain. So they felt that the Rothschild family should be the one to whom it was addressed and Walter was Lord Rothschild and he was, as honest, and those really are the background reasons. So Walter received the Balfour Declaration and I have a copy here and I wonder if I could possibly ask you to read it for us? Yes indeed. I'm going to put on spectacles to make sure I'm read it accurately. His majesty's government, deal with favor, the establishment of Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people and reduce their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object. It being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews and any other country. I should be grateful if he would bring this declaration to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation, the author Balfour. And here it is, the Balfour Declaration. What do you feel when you see it here? I've genuinely felt it's one of the most extraordinary moments in the history of the Jewish people. I think it took 3,000 years to get to this. And then you say, how did this miracle happen? It was the most incredible piece of opportunism. I mean, if you think you had an impoverished would-be scientist time vites for somehow gets to England. Meet the few people, including my family, seduces them, he had such great charm and conviction. He gets to Balfour and unbelievably persuades Balfour and Lloyd George, the Prime Minister, and most of the ministers, that this idea of the national home for Jews should be allowed to take place. I mean, it's so, so unlikely. And then he starts to fight a difficult battle with the British cabinet, and that goes through five drafts, as you know. And in the end, it comes out as a rather compromising letter. I mean, the essential point is there for the Jewish community to fasten onto. You have the first bit, which promises a national home, rather than the national home, and then you have the bit that nothing that's to be done should, in any way, harm the Arab community. But you come back to the big point, which is that this is perhaps the greatest event in Jewish life, the thousands of years. And it's a miracle.",subjective

This was what Theresa May had to say about the 100-year anniversary of the Belford Declaration. But what exactly happened on November 2, 1917, and what was the Belford Declaration all about? These 68 words were a historic promise, given to the early Zionist movement by the British government for the establishment in Palestine, of a national home for the Jewish people. Sir Arthur Balfour, then Foreign Secretary of Britain, wrote in a public letter to a famous British Zionist, Lord Walter Rothschild, which read, His Majesty's government views with favour the establishment in Palestine for a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object. It's being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, while the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country. This was just what the Zionists were looking for, as outlined in the first Zionist Congress during its meeting in Basel, Switzerland in 1897. Zionism seeks to establish a home for the Jewish people in Palestine secured under public law. Earlier, theodore Herzl, their founder, had failed to realise this purpose when he couldn't get support from the Ottomans or any other European ruler. But this declaration basically laid out the foundation for the state of Israel, and since the second part of the agreement, you know, where it talks about protecting the civil and religious rights for non-Jewish communities in Palestine was never implemented, it resulted in a great injustice towards the Palestinian people, as thousands of them lost their homeland with the creation of this new Jewish state, and the ones who remained are being treated like second-class citizens. I think the late British author and journalist Arthur Coester summed it up best when he said, one nation, solemnly promised to another nation the country of a third. What were they thinking? Well, you see, Great Britain was in the midst of World War I, and one of its biggest foes was the Ottoman Empire. So they employed the tried and tested strategy of divide and conquer. They were giving the Arabs the promise of complete and final liberation and return for rebellion against the Ottoman rulers. The crown had decided, Palestine's for the Jews, thus ensuring a perpetually divided Middle East, and 31 years after the bell for declaration, the state of Israel was founded. But it's not 100% certain that this was the initial goal of the British government. The results have brought devastating consequences to the Middle East. It paved the way for the longest military occupation in recent history and destabilized an entire region. So should the UK government be proud of this landmark letter? Or should they come to terms with the reality of what it's done?",subjective

So it's been 106 years because it was November 2nd 1917 when it came out. Arthur James Balfour was the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and he's the one who wrote this declaration which is a single sentence 67 words and it basically promised the Lannapalist under the time to the Zionist movement to build a home for the Jewish population at the time. With the full backing of the British government. This is what it says, pause to read, pay attention to this part. On the surface the language seems kind of like the Netherlands, almost towards who Arthur James Balfour called the existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine. But as the author points out they were described in terms what they were not and certainly not as a nation or a people. The words Palestinian and Arab do not appear into 67 words of the declaration. By way of contrast Balfour ascribed national rights to what he called the Jewish people who at the time were only 6% of the countries and avatents. So the British didn't intend any good will at all towards the Palestinian people at the time. And how do we know that? Well in 1919 Balfour wrote a memo which was on earth 30 years afterwards and in it he wrote this, for in Palestine we do not propose even to go through the form of consulting the wishes of the present inhabitants of the country. The four great powers are committed to Zionism and Zionism be it right or wrong good or bad is rooted into aged long traditions and present needs in future homes of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit the ancient land. In my opinion that is right. And of the very ancestors in short so far as Palestine is concerned the powers have made no statement of fact which is not admittedly wrong and no declaration of policy which at least in the letter they have not always intended to violate. And that's how the immigration of European Jewish settlers began to back by British monies and by large purchases of land they were able to oust the inhabitants and the peasants that were living in Palestine to make way for the Zionist state. So if that doesn't tell you everything you need to know about colonialist thinking and if that's who the early Zionist movement aligned themselves with after not being an everybody else's door because at first they tried to align themselves with the Ottoman Empire than to try to align themselves with Germany but it was the British who led by their own weirdly Christian-y kind of worldview decided to sponsor the colonialist project of Zionism. Because in their mind they were like the good guys because they're ushering in the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies etc. Once again Christianity is very worse this page continues to bang that gong. So yeah just crazy how hundred and six years ago the destinies of millions of people was forever altered even to the point of what you're seeing in today's news and social media and the horrible horrible atrocities are being committed this has long reaching effects for the rest of all of the area to this day. Do not support anyone who backs this crazy colonialist thinking even if they dressed it up a modern day talk. It doesn't matter if it's from the right or from the left. This is wrong and it needs to stop ceasefire for a guys up now.",subjective
