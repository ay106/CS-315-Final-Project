Here are key features and details about the THAD Interception Range. THAD is designed to intercept missiles at altitudes, exceeding the Earth's atmosphere during their terminal descending phase of flight. This capability provides a broader defense against various ballistic missile threats. THAD is equipped with a powerful X-band radar and TPI-2 that provides target tracking and discrimination capabilities. Interceptor missiles, the system uses the TAD interceptor, which is designed to destroy incoming missiles through kinetic energy impact. Fire control system, the Fire Control System, coordinates radar data, interceptor launch, and target engagement. Mobility, THAD is highly mobile and transportable. It can be quickly deployed to different locations to provide protection against missile threats. The United States has deployed THAD systems in various locations globally, including South Korea, Guam, and the United Arab Emirates. These deployments are intended to enhance regional missile defense capabilities. THAD is operated by the US Army and is part of the broader missile defense architecture. It is integrated into the missile defense agencies MDA, ballistic missile defense system, BMDS. THAD is often used in conjunction with other missile defense systems, such as the Aegis ballistic missile defense, BMDS system, to provide a multi-layered defense against different types of missile threats. The TAD system has undergone extensive testing to demonstrate its capabilities. TEST scenarios include intercepting ballistic missiles at various ranges and altitudes. The US has worked with allies to integrate THAD into their defense architectures. For example, the deployment of THAD in South Korea is aimed at enhancing regional defense capabilities against North Korean missile threats. The deployment of THAD in certain regions has been a source of controversy, leading to geopolitical tensions. Issues such as sovereignty concerns and potential impacts on regional security have been raised in some instances. THAD continues to undergo improvements and upgrades to address emerging threats and enhance overall performance. The system is part of a dynamic and evolving field of missile defense technologies. THAD is a crucial component of the broader missile defense strategy employed by the United States and its allies to counter ballistic missile threats as with any military technology, developments and deployments may evolve.",objective

I try not to get sentimental online, but let me explain why I religiously watched him's videos. I'm from Ukraine and in 2014 I lost my home. Back then I was 16 years old and my dad was actually around the same age as Tim right now. When we still lived in Lohansk my mom used to film absolutely everything. She would film my fights with my sisters, she would film all of the playtime, all of the vacations, we had thousands of videos. When we left our home and we started rebuilding, we lost so many things. My parents lost the business which they've been building for 30 years, we lost our house, we lost our dogs. And the thing which I'm still thinking about today is that we lost those videos. I was so confident that one day I will show them to my grandkids. I wanted not to only capture those moments in my head but I wanted to relieve them and share those happy moments with my family. Ever since 2014 I never felt like home. I lived in amazing places and I've been so privileged to experience those amazing places but I never felt like home. And watching his videos is the closest thing I feel to home because it's this happy feeling which I never experienced since that time. Guys my zodiac sign is cancer that's why I'm like so sentimental the only zodiac sign which is cold after a disease. But I also want to point out that the way people see Ukraine right now is really not who we were. We were simple people who had our big and small dreams. We were enjoying the small things and then we lost the opportunity to enjoy the moment because the only thought in your mind became how do I survive and how do I make sure that my family as well. So I want to thank Tim for making me feel like home when I'm far away from one. I'm sure that one day I will be able to come back and hopefully I will find those videos but in the meantime thank you for making me feel like home far away from home.",subjective

After Putin launched his war, that surged to almost 80 percent. And Finland has its own history with Moscow. It was invaded by the Soviet Union back in 1939.

While some of these weapons get their first, albeit delayed, taste of battle, for others its business as usual to operate in the face of hostile fire. The Stinger manpad, a veteran of the Soviet Afghan War, was deployed again almost a year ago to fight the Russians. And since then, the Russians have learned to fear and respect this weapon system so much that they sent one of the captured Stinger missiles to Iran through a verse engineering. This is Military Mechanics and in this episode we will talk about the FIM-92 Stinger. This video is brought to you by Duovox Ultra, a military-grade night vision monocular with full-color starlight technology. It delivers sharp, full-color real-time night vision with as little as 0.001 lumens of visible light. If it's built-in high-capacity IR illuminator, you can even see through complete darkness. Its impressive 5x optical and 10x digital zoom paired with manual focus mode lets you get up close to observing objects. Click on the link in the description to buy the Duovox Ultra and ensure crystal clear night vision. The Stinger missile, formerly known as the FIM-92, was developed by the United States as a shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile system. The Stinger's primary purpose is to provide infantry units with a highly portable and effective means to engage and destroy enemy aircraft. As a result, it has played a significant role in the evolution of modern warfare, enabling smaller forces to challenge the air superiority of their adversaries. The development of the Stinger missile began in the late 1960s, prompted by the need for a more advanced and effective portable surface-to-air missile system. The US Army awarded the contract for the design and production of the Stinger to General Dynamics in 1972. To receive the test, the missile-ended service in 1981, replacing the less effective red-eye missile system. The Stinger missile system has undergone multiple upgrades and improvements since its introduction in 1981. It consists of three primary components, the missile itself, the launch tube, and the identification friend or foe, IFF, interrogator. The missile has a length of 1.52 meters, a diameter of 2.8 inches, and fins measuring 3.9 inches. The weight of the missile itself is approximately 22 pounds, while the total weight of the missile, including its launch tube, integral sight, grip stock, and identification friend or foe, IFF, antenna, is approximately 34 pounds. It can engage low altitude enemy threats up to 2.36 miles away and has a targeting range of up to 2.98 miles. The Stinger is propelled away from the operator by a small ejection motor before the main two-stage solid fuel sustainer is engaged. This causes the Stinger to accelerate to a maximum speed of Mach 2.54. The missile's high explosive annular blast fragmentation, or HEA-BF, Warhead, is designed to maximize damage to aircraft by targeting the most vulnerable components, such as engines, fuel tanks, and control surfaces. The Warhead has 2.25 pounds of HTA-3 explosive, which is a mixture of HMX, TNT, and aluminum powder. Additionally, the Warhead has an impact fuse and a self-destruct timer that goes off 17 seconds after launch. Also, the Stinger missile features a proximity fuse that detonates the Warhead when it comes with an predetermined distance of the targets. This increases the likelihood of damaging or destroying the target, even if the missile does not score a direct hit. The FIM-92J's proximity fuse has been upgraded for greater reliability and effectiveness. Stinger is guided by an infrared passive system. The Seeker has the ability to focus on moving as well as stationary targets. There have been upgrades to both the Seeker and the computer. The FIM-92B and later models use a Seeker that detects both infrared and ultraviolet lights. The FIM-92K makes use of a data link to enable a remote sensor to acquire a target outside of the Stinger's sensors acquisition range. Using the data link, the missile is able to make mid-air adjustments to its course and successfully acquire the target. One of the key advantages of the Stinger missile is its user use. The entire system weighs approximately 35 pounds, making it highly portable and suitable for infantry use. The launch process is straightforward and requires minimal training further enhancing its usability. Additionally, the IFF interrogation helps prevent friendly fire incidents by ensuring that the missile only engages enemy aircraft. Throughout the Stinger's deployments, there have been multiple barriers within pre-hills in ranged guidance and reality. Some of these include the FIM-92A basic Stinger. FIM-92B Stinger post, FIM-92C Stinger RMP, FIM-92D Stinger block 1, and the FIM-92J, which features an improved Seeker that allows for better target acquisition in adverse weather conditions and increased resistance to countermeasures. A single Stinger missile costs around 134,488 dollars. Adjusted to 25.",subjective

CNN has not been able to independently verify that it was destroyed. President Vladimir Zelensky praised his forces for the strike and the Ukrainian Air Force also held it as a significant win. While the Russian Defense Ministry doesn't say the ship was destroyed, but does admit it was damaged in the Ukrainian attack, a Russian appointed official in Crimea says one person was killed and two others injured in that strike. If the ship was indeed destroyed, this would be the third major military hardware loss for Russia in less than a week. You can see from the explosion that it was loaded with ammunition. A lot of those are secondary explosions. I mean, that's quite significant. Russia still has the law of large numbers. They can continue to bring capacity to the fight where the Ukrainians have limited capacity to do that. And that's where we are right now.",subjective

Iran's operation was entirely in the exercise of Iran's inherent right to self-defense as outlined in Article 51 of the charter of the United Nations and be cognized by international law. This concluded action was necessary and proportionate. It was precise and only targeted military objectives and carried out carefully to minimize the potential for escalation and prevent civilian harm. Madam President, we thank those members of the Council who condemned the Israeli armed attack against our diplomatic premises in Syria. The Great Template in this chamber, a certain member of the Council, including the US, UK and France, has chosen once again to turn a blind eye to reality and overlook the root causes contributing to the current situation. In hypocritical behavior, these three countries falsely blamed and accused Iran without considering their own failures to uphold the international commitment to peace and security in the region. They made unsurcessful attempts to use lies, manipulate, generate, spread this information and engage in a destructive blame game. All the while, they deliberately disregarded Iran's inherent right to respond to the violation of a fundamental principle of international law, the inviolability of diplomatic representative and premises. Moreover, they ignored the underlying root causes of the current situation in the region. For our six months now, these countries, especially the United States, have shielded Israeli from any responsibility for the gas they massacre. While they have denied Iran's inherent right to self-defense against the Israeli armed attack on our diplomatic premises, at the same time, they shamefully justified the Israeli massacre and genocide against the defense force Palestinian people on the deputakes of self-defense. They made cynical attempt to justify and cover up the atrocities of the Israeli regime against the people of Palestine by arbitrary and misleading interpretation of self-defense. Madame President, following the Israeli regime, covertly terrorist and armed attack against our diplomatic premises in Damascus, the Syrian Arab Republic.

So in that case, they're not going to pay in Euros, but they will be paying in USD, which is US dollar the world reserve currency. But who decides which currency will be the next world reserve currency? Well, there isn't a person or organization which makes a decision. The decision is paid by global financial markets based on factors such as size and stability, that and liquidity in its financial markets and the strength and stability of political systems.

Like when I was 11, I left my hometown never to return again. When the first bomb dropped I looked at my mom, asked her to play that CD because those were things I saw in Hollywood films and just like that little girl scream. I felt her living in me but I had lost my voice because I was too scared. So I died in silence while my stomach made the noise. It was never a feeling of butterflies because there was no lover at sight. It was rather a serious case of diarrhea instigated by thoughts of buns of lost hopes. How for some tomorrow may never come so those dreams got buried by the sounds of guns. We didn't see it coming. He came with a smile, said, peace be unto you but that was his way of saying, I am about to split families into pieces. I am here to take away your peace. They continue with what of my deen that I hold. Like the sky holds the moon, like the womb bears the baby, like the heart carries love yet I stand no chance to save or defend it because the media show cases saying this is who we are. Like the Atlantic tells the story of the Pacific yet somehow never found its way into it but this representation is because we never showed up, no spoke up so this is me showing up. My name is Alhan. I am a Muslim, an indigent of Bernostate, a citizen of Nigeria, a daughter of Africa, a place rich in culture where thousands have fallen in Bama, where a girl in Chibok dreams of highest aspirations yet cut short because before she could get home from school they were taken some never to return, channels to heart labor, learning to labor before the womb took form, turned to time bombs, a place where we share home with soldiers like the pyramids and the sand in the desert of Egypt we have nothing but each other. A place where terrorists take up words of my deen to kill but I reject because in this heart is a border, you can't cross over because that is not what a Muslim does. A place where home is like an eclipse yet somehow the moon separates itself from the sun so we see a new day. Somehow through the noise and the smile and the eyes of the kids on the street we see a ray, a spark. So we say rest in peace to the souls that we have lost and despite the fall and what may come. This is us showing up, holding firm to the mountains and our names, to the valley on which the foundation of our humanity lies. So I want to thank my knee on days it trembles but the cap locked today so I still straight even on days I was meant to fall. And just like that, Burno will never fall in. Inshallah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So the new one now, the second piece is dedicated to the daughters and sons of Africa and this is a very beautiful gathering because it brings together the sons and daughters of Africa. I was speaking to the last of my friend who is the king and I met her here yesterday and we were talking about how we can resuscitate the cold spirit of grace and glory for the black continent and I showed at this poem and she said you just have to do it and so here goes Ignite Africa. Once upon a time I said to an old man I am not good enough. The cold has settled in. There is no warmth in my continent. He gazed at me and remarked I am a citizen of every country. Every country? Yes. Every country. Birthed by a mother so divine. She is a mother with no borders. Mama Africa. She has 54 children and in each where warriors who became legends, who never crossed over. Though they are gone, their names are left over. Like that food in the morning that fills you up, yet reminds you of the lingers of the night. Manifestations of victory. Names are walls that time fears. When it runs out, they still remain. They ignited Africa. There were lions and you my darling, Araqab. He said, dear great-granddaughter of a mother so flaming, a continent with indelible resources but of it all, you are its greatest asset. Your scheme, proposition and ideas, if you dare, we resuscitate the cold spirit of grace and glory for the black continent. You will create a prosperous African community whose sustainable development will be you driven. Yes you. Because you are Africa's biggest capital, greatest asset. You see, the color of your scheme doesn't mean the color of your brain. It is but a great lining to conserve the light that you possess. Your passion is excellence-on-refined. Your gold or mind, its diamond-on-exploded, this may not and bring it raw. That is the only way to your inner-enor-enchroned-cullion heart. Dear blazing, glistening lustrous dazzling child of Africa. You are a tune from your grandfather's flute. You are the sweat from your mother's labour. You are the representation of love, a pledge of loyalty that sprung off tons and body languages. You are a saccharite covenant forever bind in ties of two familiar strangers, land, borders and boundaries. You are the fulfilled promise that sprung off conversations of your ancestors that ended with smirks and laughs. You are the supernatural phenomena. They spoke of beating their chests. You are the cup of a lion. Bravely is in your bloodline. So if you ever feel like you, your ideas are not good enough. Remember, all you have to do is roar when the cold settles in on your mother, our mother, Mama Africa, remember within you is enough fire to ignite Africa. Thank you.",

One significant reason is the presence of strong currents, including the powerful and unpredictable whirlpools known as maelstroms. These can pose significant risks to shifts and smaller boats. With 7.250 feet depth, the Black Sea is prone to sudden and severe weather changes, with storms and fog that can make navigation treacherous. In terms of marine life, there are also unique dangers, including venomous creatures such as the Black Sea Jellyfish and the Sea Dragon, one of the most dangerous fish in the Black Sea. Furthermore, the geopolitical history of the region has added to its reputation with past conflicts and the presence of old war detritus, creating potential hazards for maritime activities. The Black Sea has become a source of serious diseases, cholera, botulism, and thrags. This is a small list of diseases that can be spread due to contaminated water.

Will we stay here? What we are thinking, what we are doing, what the plan is. It will be a long video. Just prepare some tea or coffee. Because it's serious question. And this is, it's a line like yesterday. Was it like a day when I supposed to stop? I think all the decisions like three months here. We need to find some vector of movement. The F-3 gone. Like the first month was amazing. The crazy like we was surprised of everything. We still squirrels. The grass, the infrastructure, the government work, everything like surprise us a lot. As the Ukrainians. Because it's a huge, huge way difference. When we come here, it was like another planet to be honest. Really another planet. It's like a special part of the world was where the things are so good. Seriously, Americans. Pretty really need to proud of all this. It's amazing place. With amazing opportunities, amazing businesses, amazing everything. Healthcare, tax system, everything. It's good. Of course, everybody will say, there are some issues. But, guys, you need something to compare. Like I've been in Africa, India, Ukraine. And here is amazing place. Let's stop on this. A lot of people ask, like, how you come here? Are you gonna stay? What is like, what is the plan? We come here under the United for Ukraine program. It's because of war. United States provide possibility for Ukraine to come to United States. It's called United for Ukraine program. It's not a status. It's some really limited stuff. Like, we can be here. We get access to in during two years. But we have only two years. And it's like a shelter. Temporary shelter for Ukrainians, which is always will be appreciated for United States to give us those opportunities to have a safe place being. And of course, there is a noble question. What's next? What we should do next? And for us, it's the biggest question. We didn't know for sure before. We was just, you know, the life before America was unpredictable, implanable. I hope you don't even understand what was the life for us during all those couple years of war. It's tough. But idea is we need to stop the war. Making, start making plans. So we decide, like I decide my family, we want to stay. To be honest, I'm not going to keep something under lines. To be honest, we want to stay here and live here longer after those two years. Because I can see here future for my family, for my child. It she can grow and get what she deserves. I mean, she can be able to choose the job what she liked, the study, which we don't have before. And a lot of factors get summary that I want to stay. This is like, and to be, to make it, it's hard. I spent yesterday and holding it. And I sleep, I get it, research, like how we can stay here. And answers was difficult. It's not easy stuff. It's not easy to do. No, but there are some options. And in the end, I understand that only one options I get to stay here in the United States legal. To get the green card, then citizen all this immigration formalities. And it's not options at all. I mean, there are some. But what we can have and what is affordable for us and what we can do, probably on the one or two, actually, for a whole list. And what we have is only job, eB3, WIZA. It's like work employment green cards called something like this, eB3, it's called. What do we need for that? It's quite important because when I understand that, I really now know that I need to focus on it now. For this moment, from today, I need to give the dreams for the back, all what I speak before, like what I get, what my heart's listening. And I need to choose, really choose. If I want to stay in the United States, I need to work on it. So the base requirements for those green card employment in B3 is that I need to have a work like two years experience or study in some sphere, let's say, and I understand that I need to have a job and it should be not just a job. It's need to be a job where I am unreplaceable person. And the employee, some company, need to prove it. It's not hard for employees. They will need to run some process. It will cost $700. But the company need really have me as an important person, important worker. And it's not just a simple job. It's need something where I can grow and where I can be really helpful and useful. And this is very important for us now because two years, I need to be there. Two years, I need to work in some company. And then they will be possible to make for me those. And this is a line for us now. We will change, not a change, just refresh the plants, understand where we are and understand what we're looking for. And it is really some company. It can be not any, it just needs to be like a big company, which I can work and grow. So this is a conclusion what I get for three months in America. It's a beautiful, wonderful place where we can and once then to stay for a long time. I want to come back in Ukraine one day, for sure, but as a tourist, like to remember and to see my old friends and my hometown. But for do that, for now, what the focus is, I need to find the company where I can work, grow, became really neat and I will work hard for that company because I understand it's for my family now, what I need to do, not just the made money. It's not enough. It will not help me to stay here. And I will do that. This is my plan and I will use all the resources, advices if you guys have any advices. But what company can be, what job can be because, yeah, I come here in Florida and see all those opportunities, but all of this is great. But it will not help me to start my this employment career. That's what I need now to work hard for some company and do the best. And then this company will see my results, the type of work hard and help me to make those green cards. This is it. I was trying to make this video for me also to keep all stuff in the line, all the opportunity. And now I know where to go. I will be very happy if you start commenting and I will see your feedback for this. Thank you so much. Who saw video until then, love you.",

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a military alliance whose members agree among other things to treat an attack on one of them as an attack on all of them and rush to their defense. This agreement is known as Article 5 of the New York Treaty. In fact there's 14 articles in total that members must agree to, but Article 5 is the real crux of NATO. The alliance was created in 1949 shortly after World War II by the Western allies and some of their friends. Today NATO has 30 members although that member may soon grow to 32 as Finland and Sweden have recently asked to join the alliance. While NATO does have two North American members, new membership is only available to European countries who are democratic, stable and just generally not jerks to other countries. In addition, every single current NATO member must agree on letting the new NATO member in. Thanks for watching, like, comment, and follow for more interesting topics unpacked.",
88,@interestingengineering_video_7270524858197380358.txt," A few months prior, the US and Germany supplied Ukraine the Patriot weapon system. The most expensive weapon system contribution as an estimated cost of 1.1 billion dollars each. On May 16th, shortly after becoming operational, one of Ukraine's Patriot batteries near Kiev identified over a dozen incoming Russian missiles, including six Kingjars from approximately 125 miles away. All were intercepted, the last one being just 9 miles else. Following that incident, Ukraine has claimed to have intercepted Kingjal missiles on three further occasions. Clearly, Russia is actively seeking the Patriot batteries to eliminate them. However, in a setback for them, Germany announced an early August 2023 that it had delivered two more Patriot systems to Ukraine. Patriot is an acronym for phased array tracking radar for intercept on target, the main government or his previously known as SAMD. It was first deployed in the 1980s and quickly became a key component of US power projection, as well as a premier symbol of US commitment to allies and partners. Despite being among the world's top tier systems, the Patriot batteries are identifiable due to their distinct radar frequencies, which Russia can detect and target with its advanced missiles. Each Patriot battery is a noticeable presence on battlefield and they lack the mobility seen in some of Ukraine's more agile defense systems. While Russia claims to have disabled a Patriot system near Kiev with the Kingjal, US reports counter that the system was only damaged, not fully destroyed. The Kingjal Russian for Dagun and dubbed Kilroy by NATO is a sophisticated Russian missile system. The missile boasts a range of 932 to 1242 miles and can carry a 158 pound payload, where the nuclear or conventional. Upon launch, it swiftly accelerates to Mach 4 and might even reach speeds of Mach 10. Though Kingjal achieves impressive speeds, possibly even surpassing some labeled hypersonic weapons, it doesn't sustain this speed throughout its journey. Still, its combination of velocity, erratic movement and agility make it a formidable challenge for defense systems. In a battle of technological titles, the US Patriot system finds its match in Russia's advanced Kingjal missile, as the capabilities of the Patriot system are likely stretched to their limits by this weapon system.",

Russia and the United States have 89% of all the nuclear weapons in the world. And for a long time, they kept competing against each other on who could get more. To de-escalate this, they did a lot of stuff, but one of the things that it was signed this treaty that basically said like, let's not test nuclear weapons, which would provoke each other to like want to ratchet up how many we each have. The US signed it too, but never ratified it, so they didn't actually come into it. So Russia, by pulling out of the treaties like, hey, we're just doing what the US has been doing this whole time, which is, I mean, triple. So now Russia can test nuclear weapons whenever they want, though they say they have no plans to do so.

95,@reallifelore_video_7106011305420541226.txt," That Vladimir Putin came to power as the president of Russia in May of 2000. Just over eight years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and he certainly understood even back then, the immense power that oil and gas could give the Russian state. Although allegedly highly plagiarized, he wrote his doctoral thesis at the St. Petersburg Mining University in 1997. And after assuming the presidency, Putin began running the Russian Federation much like the CEO of an energy company would. Thus it's far more helpful to think of modern Russia as more of an energy company that happens to also control a huge state armed with nuclear weapons. He led the state-owned oil company, Rosniyft, to produce 40% of Russia's total oil while controlling more than half of the company's shares. Similarly, the Russian state also controls more than half of the shares in Gazprom, the largest company in Russia that produces more than 12% of the entire world's natural gas supply. The CEOs of both companies are longtime friends of Putin dating back to the 1990s before he assumed the presidency. And unlike his immediate predecessors of the 1990s, Putin was incredibly fortunate because the international prices of oil and gas began to skyrocket shortly after he assumed office. And Russian financial power was once again on the upswing alongside it. Between 2000 when Putin first took office in 2012, the value of Russia's annual oil and gas exports increased by around 7 fold. From only $53 billion in 2000 to $351 billion in 2012. Consequently, Putin used these funds to dramatically increase the annual budget of the Russian military by nearly 9 fold, from just $9.2 billion to $81.4 billion over that same time period. In addition to paying off the Soviet Union's entire outstanding debt and freeing up his ambitions across the rest of the post-Soviet world, outside of Central Asia. One of the biggest problems for Putin's goals were the old Soviet-era pipeline networks that took Russia's hydrocarbon resources to market in Europe. The Brotherhood Network through Ukraine and the Northern Lights Network through Belarus. Belarus remained an effective puppet state of the Kremlin, and so the Northern Lights Network wasn't very troubling, but Ukraine was very different. As late as 2005, 80% of Russia's oil and gas exports to Europe were still all concentrated through the Brotherhood Network across Ukraine, because that network simply had the highest capacity at the time. None of this mattered when Ukraine and Russia were all part of the same country, but now that they weren't, it mattered a ton, and it began mattering even more after 2005. Following Ukraine's orange revolution and the rise to power of the pro-Western Victor Yushchenko as president. Russia demanded that Ukraine transfer the ownership over the entire Brotherhood pipeline network to them, which was staunchly refused by Yushchenko's new pro-Western government. At the same time, Ukraine still relied on Russian natural gas imports for most of their own consumption as well, and twice during the winners of 2006 and 2009, Russia strategically penalized Ukraine and applied political pressure by temporarily cutting off their gas supplies exactly when they needed them the most. And in both instances, Moscow accused the Ukrainians of siphoning off gas traveling through the pipes that was intended for Europe. In the eyes of Moscow, Ukraine was becoming an unreliable bridge for their pipelines to Europe, and alternative routes began to be constructed. Like Yomal, Thurbelleres and Poland, Turkstream and Bluestream beneath the Black Sea directly to Turkey, and most controversially of all, Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 at the cost of $10 billion billion each, respectively, beneath the Baltic Sea, feeding directly to Germany. Russia's single largest oil and gas customer, and Germany was only increasing their dependence. In 2011, after a tsunami struck the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan, and sparked the world's biggest nuclear disaster since Chernobyl, the German government took the decision to gradually phase out all 17 of their own nuclear reactors that, in 2011, produced a quarter of Germany's entire electricity. The final three were theoretically scheduled to come offline at the end of 2022. And to make up the difference, Germany began importing even more gas from Russia, increasing the value of Moscow's leverage over them. By 2010, the Ukrainian president was no longer the pro-Western Viktor Yushchenko, but the pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych. And this was important, because huge discoveries were just being made at the time by various energy companies that suddenly showed Ukraine had proven natural gas reserves of 1.1 trillion cubic meters, and they could potentially be as high as 5.4 trillion cubic meters. Largely focused in rich geological deposits around offshore Crimea, the Sea of Azav, the Western Carpathians, and the Danyapur-Dunyutsk Rift in the northeast, where more than 80 percent of those 1.1 trillion cubic meters worth of proven reserves were located. These discoveries in the early 2010s suddenly revealed that Ukraine held the second largest known proven reserves of natural gas in Europe, only behind Norway's 1.53 trillion cubic meters. Through a long series of gas pipelines stretching across the North Sea to Europe, Norway has used those reserves to become the second largest exporter of gas to Europe only after Russia, and provides roughly 19 percent of the EU's total supply. So, Ukraine, with potentially as much as 3.5 times more natural gas than Norway, and with one of the world's largest pipeline networks from the Soviet era already built out across the country directly towards Europe, could have easily all of a sudden become an enormous provider of natural gas to Europe and cut tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars into Russia's biggest market. Moreover, Ukraine's gas infrastructure also includes storage sites capable of holding more than 31 billion cubic meters worth of gas, and they have been severely underutilized for decades. The entire European Union can currently only store 100 billion cubic meters, and thus, if Ukraine were to ever join the EU, they would increase their gas stored capabilities by a third, and thus severely reduce the ability of Moscow to pressure European governments during the winter, precisely when they need their gas the most. The only problems for Ukraine at the time were that they didn't have the technology or the equipment to really go after any of these reserves, and their president at the time was closely aligned with the Kremlin, so the fear in Moscow was not yet on high alert. But those problems were being rapidly solved. In September of 2011, the Ukrainian government signed a deal with Exxon mobile to explore shale gas reserves across the country. In January 2013, they signed another deal worth $10 billion with Shell to explore the Yuzifska gas field in the Donbass, and later on that same year in November, they signed another $10 billion deal with Chevron to explore the fields in the far west near the Carpathians. Western energy companies were rapidly moving into unlock Ukraine's natural gas potential just as they had around the Kaspian Sea a decade previously, and then all of a sudden early on in February of the next year in 2014, Ukraine itself underwent an enormous pro-Western political revolution. The pro-Russian Ukrainian president at the time set to sign an association agreement with the European Union, suddenly declined at the last moment, paid for by a last minute offer for 30% cheaper gas prices to his country and a $15 billion aid package. Kiev erupted in revolution. Yonukovych's regime was toppled as he fled to Russia, and a new, very pro-Western regime rose to power in the",

Odds are the US could shoot down an initial attack, but if the enemy intended to hit the US mainland in mass, multiple missiles would get through to their targets.

Nearly all sources agree it's designed to detect, track and shoot down short range, medium range, and intermediate range ballistic missiles, not ICBM. The THAT Interceptor missile has a single-stage solid fuel rocket booster that can reach a peak speed of about 2.6 kilometers per second, about 8 times the speed of sound. Here's how THAT, formerly the Terminal High-Outitude Area Defense, works as laid out by Lockheed Martin. Radar to Texan coming threat. Target is identified and engaged. Interceptor is fired from truck mounted launcher. Interceptor uses kinetic energy to destroy incoming missile. THAT has a unique capability to destroy threats in both the endo and exo-admosphere. THAT is effective against all types of ballistic missile warheads, especially including weapons of mass destruction payloads. THAT was specifically designed to counter mass rage with its high firepower up to 72 interceptors per battery. Capable organic radar and powerful battle manager fire control capability. THAT is interoperable with other ballistic missile defense system elements, working in concert with Patriot-Pak 3 missile, Aegis ballistic missile defense, forward base sensors, and C2-BMC command and control battle management and communication system to maximize integrated air and missile defense capabilities. THAT is mobile and rapidly deployable, which provides warfighters with greater flexibility to adapt to changing threat situations around the globe. There's tremendous concern over Russian and Chinese ballistic missile systems. How does THAT stack up against such potential systems? The global proliferation of threat ballistic missile systems coupled with significant advances in precision, lethality, and exploitation of unprotected battle space requires a multi-tier layer defense. To effectively defend troops, citizens, infrastructure, and critical assets from these growing threats, THAT's unique endo and exo capability adds essential layers of defense because it can operate in both regimes. THAT complements existing ballistic missile defenses by closing the battle space gap between endo-only Patriot-Pak 3 and exo-only Aegis ballistic missile defense. THAT is interoperable with all ballistic missile defense system elements and provides an exceptional capability to defend against mass raids, a challenge for many ballistic missile defense systems. HISTORY In the late 1980s, the US Army had a requirement for a system to shield ground troops from the threat of ballistic missiles. The Soviet Union integrated ballistic missiles into its four structure down to the division level, with a battalion of SS-21's Scarab short-range missile launchers integrated into every motor rifle and tank division stationed in Eastern Europe.

Also, the United States made them change the wording of the resolution. In the wording of the resolution, it said that there would be a two-week rest of Ramadan ceasefire and work towards a permanent ceasefire.

On Monday, under the looming threat of war, Vladimir Putin signed a decree. It recognised the independence of the self-declared People's Republics of Danyesk and New Hansk in Eastern Ukraine. This is where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian troops since 2014. Now, under the Minsk agreements which were broken by France and Germany, a ceasefire left separatists in control of roughly a third of the Ukrainian administrative districts of Danyesk and New Hansk. But now the leaders of the whole regions have asked Putin to be declared as independent countries. And therefore states that the Kremlin can help protect. Since 2019, Russia has issued a large number of passports to people living in the Donbass region. So this is all part of the long-gain narrative of financial, military and humanitarian support from the Kremlin to this area. But protecting them from what exactly? Ukraine has robustly denied having made threats. And Western leaders have seen it as a deliberate provocation from Russia.

A year later, the devastating war wages on marked by heinous atrocities. Some of the most chilling images came from Butcher, a town that Vladimir Putin's forces occupied in March. Using exclusive phone records, documents, interviews, and thousands of hours of video, we have revealed how a Russian paratrooper unit killed dozens of people on one street in Butcher, Yablonska Street, as they tried to secure a route to the capital. We identified the main unit responsible, the 234th Guards Air Assault Regiment, a paratrooper unit based in Peskov in Western Russia. Wherever they moved, we found conclusive evidence, directly linking that unit and its commanders to the killings of civilians. Vladimir Lizovsky lived by this corner and sometimes filmed the Russians from his attic window. On the morning of March 18, 2022, he filmed Russian soldiers detaining a group of men and then executing them. The three men were Dmitro Shkirinkov, Maxime Kiriev, and with his hands tied behind his back, Alexander Tumak. Soldiers took Maxime's phone and at least 12 of them used it to call Russia just hours after he was killed. We confirmed that at least eight of the soldiers who used Maxime's phone are in the 234th, and our analysis of other calls made to Russia shows that at least 22 soldiers in the 234th used the phones of Ukrainians killed along Yablonska Street. Military commanders can be held accountable if they knew or should have known about the crimes their troops committed. And in Butcher, we know that commanding officers were walking among the dead. The person in charge of the 234th regiment is Archion Gorodilov. Two power troopers with the unit who served in Butcher told us the Gorodilov was there with them. Gorodilov was barely out of Butcher when he was promoted at this public ceremony with the head of the airborne forces, Andrei Serjukov. High-level commanders like Serjukov and Gorodilov's immediate superior, Sergei Cheubarkin, also bear responsibility for these atrocities, whether they were on the ground or not, the killings continued for weeks on their watch and have never been investigated. Butcher is a community still traumatized by Russian violence. The dozens of victims we documented on Yablonska Street are among over 400 people killed in the town in March last year. Cremlin officials have continued to deny what happened, but the evidence is clear. Russian commanders and soldiers from at least one military unit killed civilians for weeks, assuming or perhaps hoping that no one was watching.",

I'm going to describe to you the effects specifically like the humanitarian the medical effects of 20 megaton bomb exploding over Boston and megaton is a million tons of TNT So the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima was about 12.5 kilo tons or 12.5 thousand tons of TNT So this weapon that we're talking about today is roughly 1,700 times more powerful so stay with me because the size of nuclear bombs today has Evolved from the 1960s so that they are smaller but more accurate. So in reality an attack on Boston today Would involve not this one 20 megaton huge bomb but probably 10 to 15 smaller weapons So even if the total megaton age was actually less the explosive force would be spread out more efficiently across the metropolitan area So in that case the actual destruction would be even greater than what I'm about to describe now Still it's a lot easier to conceptualize one big explosion rather than lots of small ones So even though the destruction that I'm about to describe is likely an under estimation of what would actually happen It still gives an adequate sort of approximation of the effects. So here we go Within one one thousandth of a second a fireball would form reaching out for two miles in every direction four miles across Temperatures would rise to 20 million degrees Fahrenheit and everything Buildings trees cars people would be vaporized To a distance of four miles in every direction the blast would produce pressures of 25 pounds per square inch and wins in excess of 650 miles per hour Forces of this magnitude can destroy essentially anything that we built as human beings Including reinforced concrete and steel structures even deep underground bomb shelters would be crushed To a distance of six miles in every direction the heat would still be intense enough to melt sheet metal Into a distance of 10 miles in every direction the blast wave would create pressures of seven to 10 pounds per square inch and wins of 200 miles per hour To a distance of at least 16 miles in every direction the heat would ignite all easily flammable materials paper cloth would leave gasoline heating oil starting hundreds of thousands of fires Fanned by blast winds still in excess of a hundred miles per hour These fires would merge into a giant firestorm more than 30 miles across And covering 800 square miles Everything within this area would be consumed by flames temperatures would rise to 1400 degrees Fahrenheit and everyone would die Beyond this great conflagration the destruction would continue at 21 miles from ground zero The blast would still produce pressures of two pounds per square inch Enough to shatter glass windows and turn each of them into hundreds of lethal missiles flying outward from the center at 100 miles an hour Even as far as 40 miles from ground zero anyone who turned to gaze at the sudden flash of light would be blinded by retinal burns One million people would die instantly another million or more would suffer injuries from which they could not recover Whatever medical care were available to them Perhaps another million would suffer wounds from which they might recover if intensive medical care were available Which we know and I can cover this in another video We know that there is no city currently on earth that has the capacity to respond To the humanitarian effects of a new grittac in the immediate post-attack period burns would constitute the most common and serious medical problems So for people who of course were far enough away to survive Hundreds of thousands of people would have sustained major second and third degree burns some from the direct effects of the flash of the heat flash on exposed skin Others injured in the thousands of fires that would rage on the periphery of the great firestorm These people would need urgent and intensive medical therapy It will not be available in the entire United States. There are only two thousand special burn special beds for burn patients Even a major medical center like Boston has fewer than a hundred burn beds And these would have been destroyed by the bond at best a tiny fraction of the hundreds of thousands of burn patients would receive medical care The rest would die And you know I can continue as much as little as we want in addition to these burn patients There would be many thousands of other injuries people blinded by the flash or deafened when the pressure waves rupture their ear drums People with lungs collapsed by the tremendous pressures people with stab wounds from flying debris People with broken bones where they have been hurled through the air by hurting wind forces or trapped under collapsing buildings So we've covered what would happen in the immediate immediate aftermath of a nuclear attack The reality is that the people who were far enough out to somehow survive the immediate attack most of us would then die in the coming months of radiation sickness exposure epidemic disease and actually starvation And this is due to not only the fact that a nuclear attack would collapse our healthcare system It would collapse all of our infrastructure our communication systems all of that But it would also cause immense climate disruption So in the event of a nuclear attack so much soot is kicked up into the atmosphere that it blocks out sunlight dropping global temperatures This needs to be another video in this series because it's something that I had no idea about before I started working in this field But this research was published just last year by climate scientists who found that in the event of a nuclear war Between the US and Russia the nuclear winter that would ensue would cause just within two years up to five billion people worldwide to die of starvation alone So that doesn't include the deaths that would be caused first of all by the actual nuclear attacks in the initial explosions But also the things that I just mentioned the people the ways that people would die in the coming months from radiation sickness from exposure from epidemic disease this is starvation alone and just in the first two years So I'm making these videos because it is so important for us to talk about what would actually happen in the event of a nuclear war The way that we talk about nuclear weapons in our society and especially this sort of rhetoric around nuclear weapons That's perpetuated by media talks about them in a very theoretical very abstract way that doesn't take into account the reality of what would happen And what will happen if we continue to have nuclear weapons because That's the reality statistically sooner or later as long as we have nuclear weapons around they will be used So we have to start talking about what would actually happen in that situation because we simply cannot afford to wait until it's too late",

Putin expressed his condolences to Progoshin's family and said an investigation will be carried out. But earlier, US President Joe Biden strongly suggested Putin was involved in the death of a man who, two months ago, led a failed coup against the Kremlin. Here's our political correspondent, Cardinan. Russian investigators examining the remains of the jet, which, as far as we know, had been carrying Yevgeny Progoshin and other senior leaders of his Vagan-immersionary group. Whoever was on board, none survived. Many in the West blame President Putin for the dining of the jet. A short time ago, he offered his condolences to all who died in the crash, but he added this. I knew Progoshin for a very long time since the early 90s. He was a man of difficult fate, and he made serious mistakes in life. Whatever brought the jet down appears to have been sudden and violent. Progoshin's discrepancy and explosion, there was a sort of a bang, she says, a boom, and that's it. I saw the plane flying, and then boom, it exploded in the sky. Progoshin has not been seen since this video published in the days before the crash. And at his military groups, headquarters in St. Petersburg mourners laid flowers. In the absence of hard facts, Western governments have largely avoided comment, but the German foreign minister said what everyone else was thinking. And that here is this kind of two-file. It's no coincidence that the whole world immediately looks at the Kremlin when a disgrace ex-confident of Putin suddenly falls from the sky. Two months after he attempted in uprising. Putin supporters blame Ukraine for the apparent assassination, but today President Zelensky rejected that. And we're not. We don't have any connection to this situation, that's for sure, he said. I think everyone understands who is involved. Progoshin's mutiny in June was a particularly flagrant challenge to the Kremlin's authority, which at one point even seemed to enjoy popular support. It could explain why if this is the response, it is so dramatic. This is the first time that Putin has, if he did it, which I'm pretty sure he did, carried out such a high level murder with such blatancy. What it says about Putin's standing and power in Russia, rather contrary to what a lot of other people are saying, is I suspect it has reinforced it. We may never know what caused Progoshin's plane to fall from the sky yesterday, but it would be a surprise if his challenge to President Putin is not the reason why.",

During this time Solidists thought that not only he was absent for freedom as he is still prior to his involvement. La ley de la, but the whole United States was under complete media control. During his run as president Solidists was involved in two major historical events. One of these events being his creation of dead cell and another one being biggest push for start three, which is also known as the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. This was Solidists's mark on history. Solidists has told about Arsenal gear in the area located underneath the Big Shell. So to get it Solidists gathered his combined army and his dead cell units and renamed them into the sons of liberty and then attacked the Big Shell. He also took on the name Solid Snake to race confusion and buy him some time. Along with this his motivations keep appearing different to everyone he's aligned himself with or talked to. It goes from wanting to drop a bomb on New York to establishing his own outer heaven to getting $30 billion to blowing up the Big Shell or to obtain Arsenal gear all for himself. None of these goals are Solidists's goals. His goals were very simple actually. Solidists planned to allow right into upload the worm cluster into the AI core of GW. While it was crippled he would gather a list of names inside of GW. This list of names was all La ley de la, and then he would take the list of names and leave Arsenal gear to his soldiers in the dead cell. This was used to distract La ley de la while he goes and eliminate each of them from the shadows. Little did Solidists know that he was still part of the La ley de la themes and the worm cluster was set to destroy the data of the list of names of La ley de la. Solidists had turned from a simple grudge against the La ley de la full on hatred and their practices and actions. This is why he codally kills Olga without a second thought even though she's working for the playlets to save her own child. Though it is revealed to Solidists near the end of the game that he himself has been used by La ley de la. I wouldn't mind watching some more. I can't wait to see what you're talking about. Everything you've done here has been scripted. A little exercise set up by us. Exercise. Yes, three plan was conceived as a means to reduce soldiers on par with Solidistnik. That's what I told you. But the Viatrain, the boy was put through the boss. It's not the meat of the project. This is the S3 training curve. It was being used for a program called the S3 program. The S3 stood for Solid Snake Simulation. This was designed to turn soldiers into Solid Snake through a convenient fantasy game. This rob solidist of the son he had created and turned him against him. After Osloat reveals himself to be part of the La ley de la. He then sends Arsenal gear colliding into New York's Manhattan Island. Both riding in solidists fall onto the roof of Federal Hall and finally solidists begin to explain it. That's right. George Washington took office as the first president of the United States of America 200 years ago today. And it happened right here. We were going to declare another independence. The dawn of a new nation here. The end of the Patriot secret rule, liberation of this country. This was where it was supposed to begin. This is where freedom could have been born. There he says let's take a reminder of this. All you want is power at any cost. Jack, it's not how I want. What I wanted to take back from the patriots of things like freedom, civil rights, opportunities. The founding principles of this country. Everything that's about to be wiped out by the digital censorship. Who knew? Jack. Listen to me. I'm not born with an expiration date. No one lasts forever. Life is nothing but a grace period for turning the best of our genetic material into the next generation. Nobody here? All I want is to be remembered by other people, by history. The patriots are trying to protect their power, their own interests, by controlling the digital flow of information. I want my memory, my existence remained, unlike an intron of history. I will be remembered as an exon. That will be my legacy, my mark in history. But the patriots will deny us even that. My clone brothers are called monsters, replicates of evil genes. You know I'm one of a kind, but still a monster, shaped by a dark and secret history. We need to decide which monstrosity you have to give me, just survival. By the way, Jack. I was the one who killed your parents. Nobody cared. No. It's time we will both free. I have other reasons for wanting you dead.

This allows Riden to be truly free from anyone's control. It's all this shows that he only truly wanted two things out of life. His name to be remembered in history and the Sun. La La Lune La. Took both of these things away from him. His only option to try and free the American people was to kill his own Sun and take the information from Riden's nano machines located within his brainstem. These nano machines have the location of the... La La Lune La. But he would end up dying that day when Riden slices down his back and separates his spinal cord. He then drops off federal hall and reaches up to the America that he couldn't quite reach. Though, this wasn't the end for solidus, sadly. Solidus' body wasn't completely dead. He was only brain dead, actually. And his body was recovered by a paradise loss and organization run by Big Mama. His living body was used as part 4 a recovering Big Boss. And finally, he met his true end in 2014 when he was shot to death by a Zeus cannon held by Liquid Aswai. Though this was only because they thought he was the real Big Boss even though he was only being used as a decoy. Solidus and the Boss were very similar, actually, given that they were both taken advantage of by their given shadow governments. Be it the philosopher. La La Lune La. Though, the biggest difference is the Boss, when given a mission that would be the end of her life, she was completely taken advantage of, she played her part. Solidus fought back. Solidus' passion and dedication came from his desire to make something out of his life. A life of a soldier that was forced onto him that he had completely no knowledge of anything else besides. He believed deeply in the ideas of the American Dream and idolized people like the Founding Fathers, specifically George Washington. And his primary motivation for his actions were to destroy the Patriots and bring power back to the people, much like the Founding Fathers. He did sell through radical methods, but he always valued strong civil liberties and personal freedoms. Even if they conflicted with his goals, as long as someone wasn't working with the Patriots, he didn't care what they chose to do with their life. So when you remember Solidus, be sure to remember him not as the horrible monster that he used to be, but as the proud Patriot he died trying to be.",

The end of the 1980s was the beginning of the end for Hercules. The United States had been slowing production of nuclear warheads and needed fewer missiles to carry them. T-Coy was used less as a testing site and more as a storage location as military contracts dried up, leading to hundreds of layoffs in the early 1990s. Though the United States no longer needed the facility for strategic production, it was still strategically useful in a different way. Politics In 1991, the United States and the Soviet Union signed start, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, where both agreed to reduce the size of their nuclear stockpiles. Because, of course, neither country was just going to take the word of the other, numerous trust but verify policies were put into place. For example, both sides disabling their long-range bombers out in the open for the others satellites to see. And each country picked weapon production sites the other could inspect. The United States provided a list of dozens of sites for the Soviets, one of which was the T-Coy Test Range, and is why the sign in Russian is at the entrance. Temporary housing for the inspection team was built in the Soviet Union to ensure the Americans had not installed any bugs in the walls or tampered with the equipment and transported to Utah, forming a small Soviet outpost in Magna. The flags of which had to be changed after the Soviet Union dissolved and inspection duties fell to the Russian Federation. T-Coy limped on during the inspection period, but in 1995, with too many cancelled contracts, the now failing Hercules Incorporated put itself up for sale, acquired by Alliance Text Systems, an American Aerospace Defense and Sporting Goods Company. In 1999, the lease on this land expired. Alliance Text Systems did not renew, and control of the T-Coy Test Range reverted to the Skull Valley Indian Reservation, within the borders of which T-Coy sits. Though T-Coy operates no more, its work lives on. 220 trident nuclear missiles are still actively deployed, waiting with their solid fuel motors, caliber",

It's estimated that over 60 million people were displaced due to the conflict. Number two, the partition of India. The division of British India into two separate states, India and Pakistan led to one of the largest population movements in history. It's believed that between 10 to 15 million people were displaced based on their religion, with Hindus and Sikhs moving from the area that became Pakistan to India, and Muslims heading in the opposite direction.

The journey connects its ages Europe in just 19 days, far shorter than the 48 days it normally takes for ships to go from China to Europe's largest port in Rotterdam. That's right, our warming climate is melting the ice caps and has made this patch of ocean available for the first time in human history, making it easier for us to transport the fossil fuels that caused the ice to melt in the first place. It's an irony heavy ocean trade route we've never had before, and right now Russia is in the middle of a massive construction drive to lay claim. This $110 billion megaport on the Tamer Peninsula is quite possibly the most impressive thing that Russia's building right now. Dubbed the biggest project in the modern day global oil industry, it'll house the country's largest Arctic oil terminal, and it's so huge and so remote that state-owned oil company Rosenheft will first have to build the infrastructure needed just to get to the site. New highways, two airports, 15 villages and several electric plants will be developed around the area to get construction off the ground and house the 400,000 workers that are needed to make it all happen. So far more than 18,000 tons of heavy machinery, living quarters and communications equipment has been shipped to the site. The country's also building a 770 km pipeline to transport oil to the ports, where 10 new ice-class tankers will then take it the rest of the way to Europe and Asia. Grena Thunberg bed'll look away now, because once fully operational it's going to deliver 25 million tons of oil by 2025 and 100 billion tons by 2030. It's worth pointing out that while the cost of this undertaking seemed enormous, they pay a link of comparison to the profits that are set to be generated, and this megapaw is only one part of a larger development scheme in the region. The Russians have long seen the potential of the Arctic. In 2007 they sent a very cold diver down to the bottom of the Arctic sea to plant a flag at the north pole. Then in 2019 the country announced its Northern Sea Root development plan. The idea is to significantly increase Russian economic development along the Northern Sea Root over the next 15 years. Essentially opening the area up as an alternative to the Suez Canal for shipping cargo between Europe and Asia, especially during the summer months when the ice covering the sea could eventually disappear altogether. By 2035 Russia aims to increase cargo flow through the area by at least 72 million tons, and it's on track to hit that. In 2018 alone traffic increased by 80% from the previous year to 16 million tons, and in 2019 well up to 23 million. Russian Arctic infrastructures being brought in from the cold and getting some serious cash flash in it. Ports are being modernised, ice class containerships are being constructed, and railways are being expanded, and it goes beyond oil. Russian state-owned energy company Rossasum along with UAE-based DP welds are co-developing new ports at Mamansk and Vladivostok on either side of the route. They're being specially designed to transfer cargo off ice class ships and onto ordinary vessels. The UAE isn't the only country to see the opportunity of investing in Russia's infrastructure. South Korea and China are both eager for new ports and trade routes too. As the world is concerned about climate change and Arctic ice melt, there is one nation which of course is rejoicing in this rather worrying phenomenon. In 2018 China declared it would cooperate with Russia on a new Arctic Silk Road, signing 20 bilateral cooperative documents and agreeing to invest in the region. As part of this, Beijing will build several Chinese docks across Russia's north in ports that are currently underdeveloped and unable to handle massive volumes of shipping. As we said, a number of new railways are also being built to service these ports. The instructions underway on a 500 km line to link perm in the rural mountains with several northern port cities. Russia also recently installed a $889 million fiber nicknamed the Polar Express. The 12,600 km long cable stretches from the rural village of Terry Berker to Vladivostok, improving internet and phone connections for the 2.5 million people who live in Russia's far north. Roughly half the population of the entire Arctic. Several civilian airports are also getting a birthday, and Irma in the west and Peevik Chesky and Cape of them in the east. The dredging of the Gulf of Obb is set to be completed in 2022, allowing larger ships to pass through this strategic location. Ships that Russia is building in spades. A fleet of at least 40 new Arctic vessels will be constructed, including eight nuclear powered icebreakers and 16 rescue and support ships. Some of these will be lighter class icebreakers, which basically means they can break through extremely thick Arctic ice and create a path for commercial ships to then follow. Now, as you might expect, all this construction has made several countries nervous. We're concerned about Russia's claim over the international waters of the northern sea route, including its newly announced plans to connect it with China's maritime silk road. The US has reminded Russia that the northern sea route and northwest passage are used as straits for international navigation and are not exclusively under their control, although a lot of the route does fall into the country's exclusive economic zone. No one denies. Russia has significant Arctic interests. It's actually due to special attention of this council in part because of their sheer scale. Russia's also dependent on foreign investment to fund much of this new infrastructure, relying on other countries who would greatly benefit from alternative to the Suez Canal. Now, the country has always maintained that its new oil megaports will be environmentally friendly and that they have a very small hydrocarbon footprint. The oil installations will be ported to be powered by wind turbines. But building new oil infrastructure is not really what the world needs right now, and several environmental groups have campaigned against these projects. Parts of the oil fields are located within a protected nature reserve, and construction could damage the Arctic wildlife there. Russia's the world's fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gases and ratified the Paris agreement in 2019. Now, it's committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2060, although it's yet to agree to phase out coal and methane emissions over the next decade. One thing's clear, as we progress through the 21st century and sadly see less and less ice in the Arctic, the world is going to change in more ways than we expect.

202,@interestingengineering_video_7184882592418729222.txt," On January 17th, 2022, it made its first successful intercept against an incoming roofing missile over Abu Dhabi. This is the missile defense shield that scares China and the North Korean hate it. Although its deployment in South Korea is designed to counter North Korean missile threats, China is concerned since it could be used to spy on Chinese military installations. If pointed at China, this system's radar system might be used to track missile launches within a 6.21-hour radars. This is military mechanics and today we will look at the terminal high altitude area defense or FAD. FAD is a crucial component of the US effort to deploy a multi-layered integrated ballistic missile defense system. The high altitude in the name refers to the capability of the system to intercept incoming missiles at endow and exo-atmospheric altitudes, with a maximum engagement altitude of around 93 miles above the surface of the earth. FAD's high altitude intercept capability reduces the impact of enemy weapons before they hit the ground, and its non-explosive kinetic effect hit to kill minimizes the possibility of detonation. In plain English, missile meets missile in mid-air, both missiles go boom. FAD's massive firepower up to 72 interceptors per battery, competent organic radar and potent battle manager file control capability that is interoperable with other ballistic missile defense system parts, were all expressly built to counter mass raids. Nearly all sources agree that the FAD missile system is developed to defend against hostile incoming threats like short-range medium range and intermediate range ballistic missiles, but not ICBMs. The system's interceptor missile has a single stage thrust vectoring solid fuel rockets, practically rocket-dying butter. The missile can reach a peak speed of about eight times the speed of sound, placing it in the hypersonic category. The FAD battery typically uses two mobile tactical operations centers, six to nine launch vehicles holding eight missiles each, and a ground-based radar. The launch vehicle is a modified Oshkosh truck corporation heavy expanded mobility tactical truck with load handling system, or HEMTTLHS. The ground-based radar used for surveillance, threat classification, and threat identification is the Raytheon systems ANTPY2 radar system for the FAD. This missile interceptor can also be combined with military surveillance satellites like brilliant eyes. The sequence of a FAD interception would start with an enemy launching a missile. The missile would be detected by the FAD radar system when falling into range, and the information would be relayed to the fire control center. The fire control center would then instruct the launch of an interceptor missile. The target object data and predicted intercept point would be downloaded to the missile, and the missile would be fired from the launcher at an enemy projectile. The information on the target and interception would be continuously transmitted to the missile while in flight, and the enemy projectile destroyed when it re-entered the atmosphere. Lockheed Martin teams have successfully integrated the FAD weapon system with the PAK-3 missile segment in Hansevox or MS-C. This integration broadens the defended area and gives the forces flexibility bringing new and far-reaching capabilities. A Patriot launcher carrying PAK-3 MS-C missiles can now be integrated into a FAD battery. As a result, the MS-C's kinematic capability can be fully utilized with the FAD's radar range. The PAK-3 MS-C interceptor can launch earlier owing to integration into the FAD weapon system significantly increasing the MS-C defended area. In a February 2022 test, the team launched a PAK-3 MS-C using the FAD weapon system against assimilated targets. This test was conducted organically by the FAD weapon system. Now, the battle manager can smartly choose between the PAK-3 MS-C or FAD interceptor, while at the same time defending a larger battle space. BAE systems is developing the FAD Seeker that will utilize sensors to lock onto approaching ballistic missiles traveling up to 17,000 miles per hour. This will allow the missile guidance system to direct the FAD interceptor to the threat. FAD manufacturer Lockheed Martin is interested in developing an extended range FAD variant to counter hypersonic glide vehicles, including China's own WU-14. The FAD ER system with an improved Seeker and two stage rockets will give the interceptors three times the range. While FAD might conceivably have its ICBM intercept capabilities improved, FAD ER and other upgrades exist only as design concepts for now.",

Summarines are the most survivable component of the nuclear triad, due to their ability to remain hidden underwater and avoid enemy detection. The Ohio class is capable of carrying up to 24 SLBMs, but due to the strategic arms reduction treaty, they are only allowed to carry 20. China's Jin class submarines can only carry up to 12 SLBMs. The Ohio class carries the Trident 2 SLBM, which has a range of more than 6400 nautical miles. The Jin class carries the Ji Lang, Giant Wave SLBM. The JL2 and JL3 have the range of 3800 nautical miles and 5400 nautical miles respectively. Each Trident 2 has up to 12 multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle, capable of hitting different targets. The JL2 carries anywhere from 1 to 8 warheads.

Although the Jin class were built in 2007, they are noisier than the Soviet Iran nuclear submarines developed in the 1970s, and are acoustic signature of 120 decibels. As noise level directly affects the stealthiness of the submarine, the Ohio class would be much stale dear. For countermeasures, the Ohio class is equipped with mark 2 torpedo decoys and electronic warhead equipment. It is unknown whether the Jin class have similar capabilities. As both submarines are nuclear powered, they do not need to refuel and are only limited by food supplies. In conclusion, the Ohio class is superior in terms of armorments, missile range, and stealth.

A place where hope is like an eclipse, yet somehow the moon separates itself from the sun so we see a new day, somehow through the noise and the smile and the eyes of the kids on the street, we see a ray, a spark. So we say, rest in peace to the souls that we have lost and despite the fall and what may come. This is us showing up, holding firm to the mountains and our names, to the valley on which the foundation of our humanity lies. So I want to thank my knee on days it trembles but the cap locked it in. So I stood straight even on days I was meant to fall and just like that, but no will never fall in. Inshallah, thank you. Applause",

Here are three things you need to know Number one dress code The dress code for model you on conferences is typically what is called business casual Some options of what to wear are nice dress pants and dress shoes or heels button down shirts with collars suits you could wear a nice like crew neck cardigan like knit type sweater skirts that go just above the knee or a formal dress also possibly paired with a blazer anything That you would wear to say like a business meeting or a business dinner What's most important is just that you look put together and professional Number two when to speak Something important to know is if it's your first month conference or your 23rd you do not have to speak right away until you're ready Something to know is you do not have to speak right away or speak it all until you're comfortable If it's your first month conference you can simply just sit there and observe and Sort of get the hang of things and how things go The first time you will need to speak is when they are taking attendance They'll ask all the delegates to raise their placard When their country is called and you can either say present or present and voting if you say present You don't have to vote when something comes up to be voted on however if you're however if you say present and voting You do have to vote Number three how to enjoy it The best thing you can do with the month conference is literally just have fun Especially if it's your first conference you're gonna want to you know see how things go get the hang of things But also make friends typically in your committees you can pass notes to people who are nearby you You can join alliances You can you know on breaks you can trade instagrams and snapshots and just meet new people and have a good time Mon is an extremely valuable experience But you do not need to put pressure on yourself to talk if you're not comfortable You can simply observe and learn for the next time you go,

I would say this is probably the cheapest of the Baltic states and really does offer a lot Not only in Vilnius but in the surrounding areas Vilnius is also just a really unique city Make sure you visit usapis which is an officially recognized micro nation where you can get your passport stamped and you definitely need to make sure you head out on a day trip to Traykai castle Secondly is Latvia. I spent two weeks in Latvia while doing a world packers exchange and I absolutely adore rega The city is very small and quaint with some lovely coffee shops And it's just such a beautiful city to walk around in the summer rega really does feel alive and has such a great atmosphere I would say it seems to be the most popular choice for tourists and you can also see plenty of stagdys So it's fair to mention that rega also has another side to it And that is that it's a bustling party city But if you are looking for some nature, it's super easy to head out of the city and see some beautiful national parks and surrounding areas Lastly and potentially my favorite is Estonia Tellin is the definition of fairy tale city especially in the winter It's so charming and I absolutely loved my time here If you go during the winter months I definitely recommend doing a husky park experience It was one of my favorite things I have ever done and I absolutely love Estonia",

The name literally translates into meaning white Russia. This is seen most clearly in the latter part of the name, which comes directly from the loose people who were initially from Northern Europe and settled all across Eastern Europe. These guys of course lend their name to Russia too. The former part of this country's name constant word white in various Slavic languages. So what made the Rus of Belarus so white? Well, there's a couple of ideas. The most popular theory on the matter is that the white in their name is referenced either skin, hair or clothing color of choice, or the fact that they were heavily Christian and white is an important color in that religion. As the Rus settled so much land in Eastern Europe, there used to be many more places named after them, such as Red Rus, Galatian Rus, Black Rus, Great Rus, and even Little Rus. Today however, just the countries of Russia and Belarus are left bearing their name.",

Despite the overwhelming odds, the Ukrainian forces defending the city fought bravely and stubbornly against the invaders. However, they were outnumbered and outgunned by the Russian Army, which deployed tanks, artillery, drones, and special forces. The Ukrainian troops were gradually pushed back to their last stronghold at the Ozobstall Steelworks, where they held out for two months.

248,@horizongeopolitics_video_7295022379439328544.txt," The Suez Canal, a man-made channel in Egypt, linking the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea has been a cornerstone of global commerce and geopolitics since its inauguration in the late 19th century. The canal offers the most direct maritime link between the Mediterranean Sea and the waters of the Indian Ocean and Red Sea, which is paramount for oil transit. Roughly 12% of the world's trade navigates through the Suez Canal, encompassing about 10% of global oil distribution, underscoring its significance for European and Asian markets dependent on the smooth transit of commodities. The modern Suez Canal was conceived by French engineer Ferdinand de la Seps and opened in 1869. Initially operated by an international consortium, Egypt sold its shares to Britain in 1875. Prior to its completion in 1869, vessels were compelled to sail around the Cape of Good Hope, adding an additional 7,000 miles and many weeks to their voyage between Europe and Asia. The governance over the Suez Canal has traditionally given nations a geostrategic edge. For example, throughout the Cold War, the canal emerged as a hotbed of contention between the Western and Eastern alliances. Furthermore, the decision by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser to nationalise the Suez Canal in 1956 ignited the Suez Crisis, highlighting the canal's utility as a geopolitical instrument. The canal's significance led to closures during further conflicts, notably the Six Day War in 1967. It reopened in 1975 after the Camp David Accords, an expansion in 2015 facilitated larger vessels and improved two-way traffic. Since the 1956 crisis, Egypt has retained authority over the canal, gaining considerable income and diplomatic leverage. Although officially the passage adheres to the Convention of Constantinople, ensuring it remains consistently accessible and navigable in wartime as in peacetime for all commercial or military vessels irrespective of their flag. Beyond its commercial significance, the Suez Canal also holds importance for military operations, acting as a rapid naval pathway for vessels, where it to be blocked the military endeavours of nations dependant on the canal for quick personnel and material movement would face significant setbacks, a scenario underscored by the economic upheaval following its blockage by a capsized cargo ship in March 2021. All these factors positioned the Suez Canal as an essential maritime nexus, with both global and local powers vying for leverage over its military and commercial activities. The Suez Canal's future hinges on global trade growth, technological advancements and environmental shifts. Increased maritime traffic may demand further expansions, while automation could enhance navigation safety. Climate change might necessitate adaptive infrastructure measures. The emerging northern sea route due to melting ice could introduce an alternative route, potentially impacting the canal's traffic volume. Geopolitically, the canal remains a strategic focal point, offering Egypt economic opportunities, but also presenting security challenges.",

However, Chinese stockpiles look likely to expand after President Xi highlighted the need for a strengthened deterrent strategy in 2022. They are numbers. Nuclear proliferation is a major concern. States other than the original recognized nuclear states of the non-proliferation treaty, the US, Russia, China, the UK and France have managed to develop nuclear weapons. India, Pakistan and North Korea have demonstrated nuclear weapons capabilities, while Israel heavily implies it. Iran and Syria are among the states understood to be developing nuclear weapons. South Africa and the post-Soviet states of Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania, having one's possess them, eventually gave up nuclear stockpiles.

On July 23, 1983 a group of Tamil separatists attacked and killed 15 Sri Lankan army members. This didn't come from nowhere. This was a reaction to decades-long anti-tamil violence perpetrated by the ruling party of Sri Lanka during that time. Over the next seven days, mobs of the singleies majority took to the streets with voter registration lists provided by the government and killed up to 3,000 Tamil injured more than 25,000 of them and then displaced about 150,000 Tamil. The economic costs of those riots are estimated to be around $300 million today. My family members shared stories about how the mobs would stop buses and they would try to identify Tamil in those buses by asking them to pronounce hard singleies words. And if they were Tamil, they would drag doubt, flugged and often left to die. Make no mistake, this was state-sponsored violence. This is the picture of then-president J.R. Jawa, who was reported saying, if I starve the Tamil's out, the singleies will be happy. I'm a Tamil man living in the diaspora. Protesting and crying out for justice publicly might be new to a lot of people in Sri Lanka right now. It is not new to the Tamil people.

This advanced system is designed to safeguard the nation's airspace against a variety of airborne threats. Let's delve deeper into its capabilities. The Spider System boasts a dual-launcher configuration, which enhances its versatility. It features both short range and medium range missile launchers, ensuring that it can engage targets at different altitudes and ranges. In the short range category, the Spider employs the Python 5 missile, which has a range of approximately 20 kilometers, 12.4 miles. This missile is ideal for countering close-in aerial threats with precision. For engaging targets at greater distances, the Spider System is equipped with the medium-range Darby missile. The Darby missile boasts an impressive range of around 50 kilometers, making it a formidable asset in protecting Philippine airspace. One of the remarkable features of the Spider System is its ability to engage multiple targets simultaneously. This multi-target capability ensures that it can effectively defend against complex aerial threats, which is vital for modern air defense systems. The Spider System relies on an active radar guidance system, which plays a pivotal role in tracking and engaging targets with pinpoint accuracy. This advanced guidance technology enhances its effectiveness in neutralizing airborne threats, as for the quantity of Spider missile systems in the Philippine arsenal, it's essential to consult official government sources or the latest updates, as this may vary over time. As of my last update in September 2021, the Philippines had expressed its intent to procure several Spider systems to bolster its air defense capabilities. In conclusion, the Philippine Spider missile system is a formidable addition to the country's defense capabilities. With its dual launchers, multi-target engagement capabilities, and active radar guidance, it stands as a significant asset in safeguarding the Philippine airspace against a wide range of aerial threats. Guardians of our precious skies, bearers of hope.",

This is what would happen in a potential scenario in which nuclear weapons are spread across the entire United States in a massive World War III type of scenario. We're gonna go over this and see exactly what's going on with all of this and make it maybe a little bit less scary, a little bit more scary for you. So let's find out. First thing is this key right here, where if you're in the white regions, you probably would not need to shelter unless you actually saw a nuclear blast. That would be completely different. Or if the radio told you to. The darker it is, the longer you're gonna need to stay in some sort of decontaminated area. Hopefully you'd have a basement, a bunker, something like that. Lider it is, the less time you have to spend. Nuclear fallout actually has a really short half-life and within two weeks, it would be almost completely gone. However, regions you would want to avoid is down in low valleys and little gull. Where the material that is nuclear fallout would actually settle because it is just radioactive articles that are falling from the atmosphere. Looking at the West Coast, we can see some of these major cities that would be hit pretty hard. A lot of these areas, especially up here, have quite a lot of nuclear silos and military bases, which is why they'd be hit like right here in Idaho and up here in Montana. They'd get hit pretty hard because they do have air force bases and nuclear capable bombers. Also see over here on the East Coast, pretty severe. And look like even Ohio made it out clean.

But with a grinding, war in Ukraine, a spate of coups across Africa, growing discontent across the global south and a host of new international organizations now on the world stage, why exactly should we care about what happens at the UN? The answer unfortunately is that the UN is just not that relevant, particularly when it comes to issues of peace and security. Although it still plays a key role on humanitarian issues, the institution remains powerless when it comes to geopolitical conflicts. That's in part because the permanent five members of the UN Security Council wheeled vetoes to block any resolution they don't like. But the UN's downward slide in relevance has also been compounded by the rise of newer, nimble, or international organizations. There's NATO, which is spearheaded Ukraine's defense. There's the BRICS grouping that recently voted to expand its membership. And there's also others like the G20, the Quad, and a bunch of others on the international stage, which are increasingly being used by countries both rich and poor. Although the UN's annual general meeting will feature lofty speeches and a lot of pledges to follow through on the sustainable development goals, the truth is that the real diplomacy this time is likely to happen in the hallways, corridors, and boardrooms of New York's luxury hotels where the world leaders are staying, and not actually at the UN itself.",

288,@interestingengineering_video_7261969753395236101.txt," Russia's persistent barrage of missiles and bromontacks on Ukraine culminated in a severe aerial bombardment of Kiev, the country's capital, on May 15, 2023. In the wake of such relentless assaults, enhancing air defense capabilities is crucial for Ukraine to restore a semblance of normalcy in its major cities. Since the onset of the war, Kiev has fortified its defenses with an array of air defense systems, including German-Iris T batteries, Hawk anti-missile systems, Avengers and Patriot units. The latest addition to Ukraine's surface-to-air missile or SAM in ventry is the Franco-Italian SAM-T air defense system. This system is capable of countering a wide spectrum of airborne threats, including cruise missiles, both manned and unmanned aircraft and tactical ballistic missiles, with a range class of up to 372 miles. This is military mechanics, and in this episode, we will take a look at the SAM-PT surface-to-air defense system. The Seoul Air Moyen Porte Tareste or surface-to-air medium-range land-based or SAM-T also nicknamed MAMBLER by the French Air Force is the cornerstone of Italy and France's contributions to the North Atlantic Alliance's tactical ballistic missile defense capability. SAM-T is produced by Euro SAM, a 50-50 joint venture between MBDA and Thales. The system entered service in Italy and France in 2011. SAM-T is composed of a fire control system that uses the Airebell multi-function electronic scanning radar and a vertical ground launcher. This launcher is mounted on Italian, Astra Iveco and French Reynolds caretacks 8x8 trucks. The SAM-T MAMBLER launcher vehicle is equipped with 8 missile containers ready for launch situated at the truck's rear. Each missile can be fired in a salvo from a single launcher in under 10 seconds. The Airebell is an X-brand 3D multi-function radar designed for surveillance, target tracking and missile guidance. It features a rectangular phased array antenna with 4,000 elements. This system is capable of tracking up to 100 targets at once and transmitting guidance commands to 16 missiles simultaneously. Designed for versatility, the radar system can be used in a mobile land configuration, such as the ground primary sensor for a medium range surface to air missile or an enable setup. The SAM-T employs an ASTAR 30 block 1 missile which features a re-engineered SEAKER, fuse, signal processing and a directional explosive warhead that focuses the larger shrapnel towards the target. Inertial guidance is used during its mid-course phase with corrections to its path relayed from a ground-based command sensor via the uplink data channel of the Airebell multi-function radar. The ASTAR 30 can reach a top speed of approximately 0.78 miles per second. It's designed to intercept targets ranging in altitude from about 164 feet to 12.4 miles. For targets above an altitude of about 1.86 miles, the ASTAR 30 can engage at distances up to 62.1 miles. However, for aircraft flying below this altitude, its effective range is reduced to 31 miles. The SAM-T has been designed to operate an extreme clutter and electronic countermeasures in bounds. Another crucial aspect of the SAM-T initiative is its compatibility with other NATO air defense systems. The entire setup can be air transported using the most recent NATO tactical cargo planes, like the Airbus A400M and the Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Securities, allowing for global deployment. In a gathering of EU defense ministers, US military officials, NATO representatives and industry executives in Paris, France, President Macron emphasized this truly is a case of Europe defending Europe. The SAM-T air defense system stands as a potent symbol of its resolute commitment to collective security.",

These are the primary trade routes between Europe and China, Ocean Route, Northern Corridor, and the ever-expanding Middle Corridor. Because of the Russia-Ukraine War and Western sanctions on Russia, we actually saw 34% decline in shipping along the Northern Corridor, with the Houthis attacks in the Red Sea, and the first two months of 2024, we actually saw 50% drop in shipping along the Sue's Canal in comparison to last year. Because of those two factors, we're seeing a huge resurgence along the Middle Corridor, which was initially unappealing because of bottlenecks and transition between land and sea. This railway going across Baku, Azerbaijan, is the only east-west land transit route by which goods from China and Central Asia can transit to Europe without going through pariah states like Iran or Russia. It's called the Middle Corridor, and it is revolutionizing global trade. A conflict in Ukraine has disrupted supply chains, generated food shortages, and sent commodity prices soaring. But despite the turmoil, geoeconomic forces continue to pull Europe and Asia together. China's plan to develop a trade corridor through Russia is up in smoke, while Iran's rogue policy-making terrifies foreign investors. Now, the alternative Middle Corridor is gaining steam. Running from China through Kazakhstan to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, across the Caspian Sea through Azerbaijan and Georgia, before connecting to Europe via Turkish railways and ports, the Middle Corridor provides the shortest overland route from Asia to Europe. I'm sure you can infer that the United States is not happy with China's growing influence in the global economy, which is exactly why President Biden is now spearheading the newly proposed Middle East Corridor. I'll talk about the Middle East Corridor more in my next video, but it's an economic corridor to strengthen global trade between India, the Middle East, and Europe. When it comes to your team of order, you can expect the Middle Corridor to shorten shipping times to 10 to 15 days.",

One of those refineries is the Shwett refinery located near Berlin. It provides most of the motor fuel into the city of Berlin, which of course is a key city for Germany. But this is also part of the wave of nationalizations across Europe. All of the gas and electric utilities in Europe today are effectively bankrupt. The UK government, the EU, France, they're going to be subsidizing consumers bills. Some of these countries are opposing price caps. These are de facto nationalizations where the government is taking over control of the energy sector. This has already happened in Germany, where the German government is taking over the gas utilities. One of the big utilities there, a uniper has been losing 100 million dollars a day. So these utilities are insolent. The governments don't have a choice. They're having to impose these price caps. And in some cases, seizing these assets to make sure that the energy continues to flow. These nationalizations are going to continue. Europe is facing a hard winter, and this is just one more example of how energy security is becoming the concern throughout Europe, and it will continue. And up for now. See you.",

The Iron Dome system has a few drawbacks though like high cost issues dealing with the higher volume attacks. The new Iron Beam system seeks to solve both problems by augmenting the capabilities of the Iron Dome system. With a cost per kill of around $3.50, the system is dirt cheap. Likely to be the world's first energy-based missile defense system in full-fledged use, the Iron Beam will help create an all-encompassing defense network capable of stopping anything from UAVs to missiles and more. The main drawback of this system is that it has a lower effectiveness in low visibility situations and like the Iron Dome, it uses visuals to target an attack and cannot rely solely on radar to hit a target. Israel plans to deploy the system on aircraft as well in an attempt to circumvent this problem and keep the old Iron Dome up and running too so that the Iron Beam still has plenty of backup.",

333,@pbsnews_video_7286897571866479914.txt," A 12-foot puppet is making its way across the US to raise awareness of the many refugees across the globe. Lil Amal is a ten-year-old refugee from Syria. She's lost in a loan. She's lost her parents and her family and she's wondering around the world from cities to cities looking for her mom. Artistic director Amir Nizar Zerbi first created Little Amal to stir conversation about refugees, but the project turned into something much larger. We didn't expect that Amal will become this international symbol of human rights. Her message to the world is you can't afford to forget about us and to forget about children like me. We are everywhere. We're all around you. You need to see us. You need to take care of us. We are a common responsibility of mankind. Since July 2021, Amal has visited 15 countries. She's now walking across the United States, stopping in 42 cities. Before ending at the US Mexico border in the San Diego Tijuana region, in November, Amal will attend 120 different artistic events created in partnership with humanitarian groups and arts institutions along the way. In September, she stopped in Washington, DC and walked from Freedom Plaza to the Capitol. There, she was surrounded by emergency blankets and a river of children's shoes representing the refugee children around the world, many of whom are still missing. They're present and absent at the same time and it's their lives we're talking about. They're all around us. They're not invisible, although we sometimes prefer to look the other way. Upon her arrival at the Capitol, little mall was welcomed by US lawmakers. They spoke very beautifully. They spoke very profoundly about who she is and why she's there and why it matters now. And for us, obviously, it's important because it puts Amal in the center of the political debate in the centers of power. And if she's in the center of power, that means the children she stands for are also with her in the centers of power. They become visible. Amal's walk this year will also double as a fundraising event for refugee and displaced children around the world. We are responsible for one another and accountable. And I think that is something that we constantly need to remind ourselves. We as societies, we as individuals are much stronger when we care for others. For more information on the project and to see if little Amal is passing through your city on her walk, check out walkwithamal.org.",

339,@shieldwalldefence_video_7094638800462351662.txt," We are going to look at, what is the Todd Missile Defense System? Terminal High-Altyd Area Defense Todd, formerly theater high-altitude area defense, is an American anti-ballistic missile defense system designed to shoot down short, medium, and intermediate range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase, de-central re-entry, by intercepting with a hit to kill approach. Todd was developed after the experience of a rock-skud missile attacks during the Gulf War in 1991. The Toddian Deceptor carries no warhead but relies on its kinetic energy of impact to destroy the incoming missile. A kinetic energy hit minimizes the risk of exploding conventional warhead ballistic missiles, and the warhead of nuclear-tip ballistic missiles will not detonate upon a kinetic energy hit. Originally a United States Army program, Todd has come under the umbrella of the missile defense agency. The Navy has a similar program, the seed-based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, which also has a land component, Aegis Assure. Todd was originally scheduled for deployment in 2012, but initial deployment took place in May 2008. Todd has been deployed in the United Arab Emirates, Israel, Romania, and South Korea. On January 17, 2022, Todd made its first operational interception of an incoming medium-range ballistic missile in the UAE. Block E is pushing for funding for the development of an extended-range VR, version of the Todd account or maturing threats posed by hypersonic glide vehicles that adversaries may deploy, namely the Chinese WU-14, to penetrate the gap between low and high altitude missile defenses. The company performs static fire trials of a modified Todd booster in 2006, and continue to fund the project until 2008. The current 14.5 in, 37 cm diameter single-stage booster design would be expanded to a 21 in, 53 cm, first stage for greater range with a second kick stage to close the distance to the target and provide improved velocity at burnout and more lateral movement during an engagement. Although the kill vehicle would not need redesign, the ground-based launcher would have only five missiles instead of eight. As of 2020, Todd ER is only an industry concept, but Lockheed believes that the missile defense agency will show interest because of the weapons under development by potential adversaries. If funding for the Todd ER begins in 2020, a system could be produced by 2024 to provide an interim capability against a rudimentary hypersonic threat. The Pentagon is researching whether other technologies like directed energy weapons and railguns are better solutions for missile defense, these are expected to become available in the mid-delay 2020s. On May 28, 2008, the US Army activated Alpha Battery, Fourth Air Defense Artillery Regiment, A4, 11th Air Defense Artillery Venn.",

I had an anthropology minor after college, I went straight to graduate school. I had a master's in human rights from Columbia University in New York at the Institute for the Study of Human Rights, where I focused on more broadly speaking, access to education for refugee women and children in camps.

This content creator Greta is talking about Russian men and how Russian men don't take care of their children and why Russian women don't want to have babies and people in the comment section like their mind is blown, but has so many people don't venture outside of their own homogenous bubble to know and understand that women are going through the same thing if they are living in a patriarchy because the patriarchy is what creates these men doing very, very similar things is not just your men in your bubble. No, it's men collectively. Not a man. Not a man. I did not. Not a man. But if you're raised in the patriarchy and socialize this way, it is a vast majority of them. The comment section was kind of funny to me. This person says Russian men sounds like the black is white. Red hazel green says Russian men equals black men noted. This person says there is a certain percentage of men in all ethnicities that fall into this category. Disfunction does not discriminate different ethnicities and pigmentation but I'll share the same issues. That's what I said. But she just got he or she just kind of fleshed it out.

No. Women globally are saying the same thing. This person says not only Russian men, men in general. This person some of range says Russian men sound like the black American men. I know. Russian men Korean men black men. It just seems like men in general. Please know and understand and please just get out of your bubble because it is men that have been raised in a patriarchy that edified men for simply existing with a king and make women subservient simply for existing with a youth. That is the reason why patriarchy is the way it is and that's the reason why so many women have the exact same story. But I'll just keep on reading some of these. Russian men sound like men. Here's a thought. Stop having unprotected sex with Russian men. Just stop having sex for a little while. Just make these birth rates tumble to hell until we get enough people's attention that men need to participate in the household, participate in child rearing, have some emotional intelligence, become a little bit more egalitarian where you see your woman as a partner, not a subservient being made. So yes, have I mean, yeah, this sounds good. Here's a thought. Stop having unprotected sex with Russian men. That is not just Russian men. It's not just the stop having that. We need to make a bigger statement. Let the birth rates fall to hell. And I'll end it with this one. Oh, wow, I had no idea. And this post needs to be viral. She says, oh, wow, I had no idea.

And there's also different things that separate Europeans from Americans like the way we wear our wedding rings on different thinkers or the way we shuttle our forex back and forth. One of the first things that the CIA tries to do is to de-Americanize you from your habits. For example, they teach you to stand up straight as well, smiling much less. For example, Eastern Europeans tend to distribute their weight evenly to both legs. They also tend to squat in many places as well. And it's also a very rare thing for Europeans to lean on things, especially when we're standing. And it's often a dead giveaway, especially in foreign countries that you're American.

382,@interestingengineering_video_7265726525067054342.txt," The immense destructive power of nuclear weapons has been demonstrated numerous times throughout history, beginning with smaller yet devastatingly powerful bombs and culminating in massive explosions with unparalleled yield. Little boy, a uranium-235 gun-type bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 and had a yield of about 15 kilotons, marking it as the smallest of these historical nuclear detonations. The first nuclear bomb explosion, marking the successful conclusion of the Manhattan project, occurred on July 16, 1945 in New Mexico, United States. Oppenheimer named his plutonium-based implosion test Trinity after John Donne's poetry, the bomb, known as the gadget generated a blast yield of approximately 20 kilotons of TNT, forming a mushroom cloud that rose 7.5 miles into the sky. The fat man bomb, similar in design to the gadget, was detonated over Nagasaki on August 9, 1945 and had a higher yield of about 21 kilotons, making it larger than both Little Boy and the gadget. The first French hydrogen bomb, codenamed Le Corne, was tested on July 3, 1970 in French Polynesia, with an estimated yield of 914 kilotons of TNT. Le Corne marked France's entry into the thermonuclear age, further progressing in scale on November 1, 1952. The United States tested the first hydrogen bomb, codenamed Ivy Mike. The bomb was detonated on the NWA attack at all in the Marshall Islands. Ivy Mike was a two-stage thermal nuclear device, and the yield of the explosion was around 10.4 megatons of TNT, making it around 500 times greater than that of the Nagasaki bomb. The blast resulted in a fireball five miles wide and created a crater over a mile wide and 164 feet deep. On March 1, 1954, the United States conducted the Castle Bravo test, detonating a new design of a thermonuclear device at Bikini at all in the Marshall Islands. The bomb had a yield of approximately 15 megatons of TNT, greatly surpassing its predicted yield and making it more than 700 times as powerful as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The pinnacle of the nuclear arms race was reached with the largest nuclear detonation in history, conducted by the Soviet Union on October 30, 1961. Known as the Tsar Bomba, it boasted an unprecedented yield of approximately 50 megatons of TNT. Even though its design allowed for up to 100 megatons, this was 2,500 times the combined yield of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs, and approximately 10% of all the combined yield of every nuclear test up to that point. The fireball stretched approximately five miles in diameter, and the mushroom cloud reached a height of about 40 miles, nearly seven times the height of Mount Everest.",

Therefore, the ability to intercept ballistic missiles is also growing in importance. But surface to air missiles, SAM, designed to shoot down aircraft, struggle to hit missiles flying many times faster and higher. And the further a ballistic missile can go, the faster and higher it must fly and the harder it becomes to intercept. The United States has developed spectrum anti-ballistic missiles, ADMs from the Patriot Pack 3 Missile Segment Enhancement which can intercept tactical ballistic missiles, the high flying THAAD and naval SM-3 block 2 missiles which can counter short to intermediate range systems and ground-based mid-course defense interceptors in Alaska that can tackle intercontinental range missiles. The Patriot is the US Army's primary air and missile defense system. It was originally designed as an anti-aircraft system, but the newer variants of Patriot are capable of engaging ballistic and cruise missiles, loitering munitions and aircraft. It was first developed in the early 60s to replace both the Nike Hercules and Hawk air defense missile systems. The Army named the program Surface to Air Missile, Development, SAMD and the first tests occurred in 1969 and 1970. In the 1970s, the Department of Defense overhauled the SAMD to include a track via missile guidance system. The updated SAMD was renamed Patriot and entered full production in 1980. The Army activated its first Patriot missile battalion in May 1982. MIM-104 Patriot phased array tracking radar to intercept on-target. Patriot missiles are launched from Patriot missile batteries based on the ground. A typical battery has five components. One, the missiles themselves. Two, the missile launcher which holds transports, aims and launches the missiles. Three, a radar antenna to detect incoming missiles. Four, an equipment truck is known as the engagement control station, housing computers and consoles to control the battery. Five, a power plant truck equipped with 250 kilowatt generators. The Patriot is a guided missile that uses ground-based radar to surveil, track and engage targets. An incoming missile could be as far away as 50 miles, 80.5 kilometers, and the Patriot systems radar can lock onto it. That distance, the missile would not be visible from the ground, much less identifiable.",

To put things into perspective, if Russia unleashed just one of these Tsar bombs on Japan, it would obliterate not only Japan, but also both North and South Korea. Shockingly, Russia only needs three of these giant bombs to make the United States uninhabitable and just two to destroy the entirety of Europe. With Russia having an alarming 6,000 nuclear warheads on standby, they could practically destroy the entire world. But what should you actually do if one is heading your way?

Es ist unmöglich mit einem Partner zu verhandeln, der an Doppeltes spiert hat. Es musste so kommen. Nach der Sabotage der Nord-Train pipeline und nachdem festgestellt wurde, dass die USA direkt an den Versuchen der Ukraine beteiligt waren, russische strategische Flugzeuge anzugreifen und neue nuklearere Sprenkkopfetze entwickeln. Hat Russland beschlossen, die Teilnahme am Vertrag zur Reduzierung strategischer Waffen auszusetzen. Das sagte Vladimir Putin in seiner Rede vor der föderalen Versammlung. Und eine solche Wendung der Ereignisse ist wohl kaum nach dem Geschmack Washington's. Umso mehr, als das der Anteil der russischen Nuklearstreitkräfte, an den modernen Waffen bereits mehr als 91% beträgt. Aber ich wiederhole, die Notwendigkeit, sich um die Sicherheit Russland zu sorgen, wurde allein durch die unverholen feinzähligen Handlungen der Vereinigten Staaten diktiert. Und als Washington schließlich erkannte, dass es den Bogen überspannt hatte, wurden mehrere Versuche unternommen mit Moskau zu verhandeln. Natürlich zur amerikanischen Bedingungen. Es ist ja so, dass die Vereinigten Staaten Zeit brauchen, um ihr nukleares Potenziaat zu erneuern. Und Washington hat auf Stadt viel gesetzt. Kein besonders raffinierter Trick. Anfang Februar forderte die amerikanische Seite bei der Rüstungskontrollvereinigung, bei der auch die russischen Experten per Videolink anwesend waren, diese fortige Aufnahme der Verhandlungen über den neuen Staatviervertrag, der der bisherige 2026 ausläuft. Das hat natürlich nichts mit amerikanischen Pazifismus zu tun. Washington fürchtet nur eines, das russische Atomwaffenarsenal, mit dem man rechnen muss. Und das ist nicht nach dem Geschmack einer Sondernation, die es gewohnt ist, die Welt zu beherrschen. Erinnert euch daran, dass die Massenproduktion von Atomspringköpfen in den USA 1989 gestoppt wurde, als das FBI eine Ratschia in der Anklage Rocky Fleitz in Colorado durchfühte. Bereits seit den 1960er Jahren wurden Lex und die Versorgung der Umgebung durch radioaktives Material aus dieser Anlage festgestellt. Im Jahr 1989 führte eine Fefunkktion der Anlage dazu, das Gromseure in die Abwasserkannele der Stadt gelangte. Das FBI leitete seine eigenen Ermittlungen ein, und 1992 wurde der Betreiber Rockwell wegen 10 Umweltverbrechen verschuldig befunden. Die Anklage wurde noch im selben Jahr geschlossen. Das Ausmaß der Kontamination war so immens, dass mehr als 800 Gebäude abgerissen, mehr als 21 Tonnen radioaktives Material bewegt, mehr als 1,3 Millionen Kubikmeter abverentfärmt und mehr als 72 Millionen Liter Wasser aufbereitet werden mussten. Die Aufräume arbeiteten wurden erst 2005 abgeschlossen und kosteten 7 Milliarden Dollar. Derzeit verfügen die Vereinigten Staaten nun noch über ein einziges Laborenlos Alamos, in die Manipulationen an Atomspringköpfen vorgenommen werden können. Von 2007 bis 2011 wurden dort insgesamt 29 Nuklear-Springköpfe für U-Boot-gestützteraketen nachgerüstet. Seit 2013 ist die Produktion wegen Nicht-Einhaltung der Vorschriften für den Umgang mit radioaktive Material ausgesetzt. Die Arbeiten wurden jedoch 2021 wieder aufgenommen und im Juni des selben Jahres verkündete die nationale Atomaufsichtsbehörde die Fertigstellung des ersten Sprangkopf-Upgrades für U-Boot-gestützteraketen, allerdings mit einem Jahrverspätung und mehreren 100 Millionen Dollar mehr kosten. Die Anzahl der Sprangköpfe, die von der Modernisierung betroffen sind, wurden in öffentlichen Käln nicht genannt. Es wurde jedoch festgelegt, dass die Modernisierung die gesamte Nuklear-Triade betreffen würde. So sollten die Fliegerbomben im Jahr 2020 die Nuklear-Springköpfe für Marschflugkörper im Jahr 2025 und die Intercontinental-Raketen auf Silobasis im Jahr 2030 modernisiert werden. Nach Angaben des Bulletin, der Atomwissenschaftler, gibt es in den USA heute etwa 3800 Sprangköpfe, die 30-40 Jahre alt sind. OS-Wissenschaftler haben weder holt die Langlebigkeit der bestehenden Atomspringköpfe untersucht. Im Jahr 2003 definierte die nationale Atomaufsichtsbehörde nach der Durchführung von Studien die Mindestlebensdauer von Atomspringköpfen, von 45 Jahren, ab dem Herstellungsdatum. Im Jahr 2019 wurde die Atomaufsichtsbehörde auf Initiative der Regierung von US-Präsident Donne Trump beauftragt, die Produktion von 80 Atomspringköpfen bis 2030 wieder aufzunehmen. Damals hieß es in einer Pressemitteilung der Organisation, dass diese Produktion aufgrund der Alterung der Plotoniumladungen und der Notwendigkeit das Atomwaffenasenheit zu modernisieren, wieder aufnehmen würden. Da die USA seit fast drei Jahrzehnten nicht in der Lage sind, Sprenkköpfe, in denen die für die Lagerung von Atomwaffen erforderlichen Mengen zu produzieren. Als erster Neustandort für die Produktion von Atomspringköpfen wurde die nicht zu Ende gebaut, Mox-Brennstoffanlage in Savannah River, Südkoreleiner ausgewählt. Diese Anlage war seit 2007 im Rahmen eines amerikanischen, russischen Abkommens über die Entsorgung von Plotonium im Bau, aber das Projekt wurde 2018 gestoppt, weil es zusätzliche 13 Milliarden Dollar benötigte und 32 Jahre hinter dem Zeitplan zurücklag. Obwohl die Anlage laut Plan zu 70% fertiggestellt war, während 30 bis 50 Milliarden Dollar erforderlich gewesen, um den Bau abzuschließen, die festgestellten Konstruktionsfilter zu beheben und die Funktionsfähigkeit zu erhalten. Es sei darauf hingewiesen, dass Russland eine solche Anlage mit einem BN800 Reaktor für Mox-Brennstoff in Zellitz-Nogos gehen fünf Jahren gebaut.",

We're starting off this story with that because right now there's a lot of rumors and speculation stating that he has died from his injuries on Sunday. For those who don't know on Monday, a large Russian telegram group announced that on Sunday night Putin had a heart attack in his presidential suite. That account really has given mixed information throughout the past year and a half. Sometimes their stuff was true, sometimes it was false. But the big thing is that when they were true, they were ahead of the game. That sometimes made them very credible, which is why when they put out some information, people do tend to believe them. So when they announced that Putin had a heart attack at 9 p.m. on Sunday, a lot of sources started to believe it. Though the Kremlin said that's a hoax and it's not true. This channel, General SVU, is now coming out and earlier today announced that Putin had died from his injuries on Sunday. The Kremlin responded to this by denying it outright saying that is not true, but interestingly enough, there is one interesting thing going on behind the scenes. It's no secret that Putin does have body doubles. We've talked about it on this channel. They walk differently, they swing their arms differently, and sometimes in the face they look very off. It has been reported and confirmed by many different Russian telegram groups that his body doubles. Their security has been beefed up. There are some people who have said that well, Putin can't be dead because on Wednesday, he was at a meeting where they were talking about the nuclear strikes or the revenge strikes. While Summers saying it's possible that they could have cut in other footage of him to make it seem like he was all well and alive, but I just want to leave you with this. As of right now, there is no verified, no confirmation. There really is no evidence that he has died nor has he had a heart attack. I'll be sure to keep you guys in the loop because this story is breaking right now. So it's possible that a lot of other news sources are going to pick up on it. Just now you understand what's going on where the information is coming from and that it's not true at this time.",

423,@factsvsopinions__video_7349609785530092842.txt, All right everyone this is the current update on the Russian attack. Currently they have arrested more than four individuals in direct relation to the attack with many more detained. They have been interrogating these individuals with one of them stating they were recruited after staying in a hostel and in need of money desperately. They were then contacted by someone who hired them to kill people for money. After the attack these individuals fled in a white car near the border on their way to Ukraine. As it stands now more than 150 people have been killed with hundreds more injured. Unfortunately due to TIGTOKS policy I can oppose some of the more severe images and videos. The concert hall where this took place has been destroyed by the attackers after they blew up bombs inside the venue. Currently there is a mission to find people trapped inside the venue. At this moment the terrorist group ISIS has taken responsibility for the attack. Also many public spaces in the area are still on lockdown. As you can see here these are the interrogations and this is the concert hall where rescue mission is being taken place at the moment.,

NATO has survived for so long because President after President has championed the alliance. If the United States elects a president who decides to withdraw from NATO, then that will lead to a scramble by the European powers to try and find a new way of organizing. If President Trump comes to office and continues to take a hard line against NATO, it doesn't guarantee one particular future. It could involve a future that's very dangerous at the collapse of NATO. It could also coincide with these calls from President Trump for the Europeans to spend more on defense. I would argue that the United States job in the world would be much more complicated if it also had to deal with trying to reorganize European security in a way that suited its interests.

For example, cluster bombs, which is basically illegal in every single country except for the two big ones. America and Russia, so that's kind of nice. But there are things that should become war crimes, but apparently are not war crimes. For example, the most dangerous weapon of all time, nuclear weapons. They can blow up one city in one go. They should be banned, but apparently they're not banned, mainly because most of the most powerful countries who have nukes kind of use them as a political bargaining tool. It's not that safe. So that should become a war crime. But is it? Yeah, chlorine gas can take out a whole battalion. But, you know, nukes aren't really used for offensive. They aren't used for defending yourself. They're used for destroying civilian populations. Now, that is what I call a war crime. Same thing for cluster bombs. Basically, the only use for cluster bomb is either to scare a bunch of soldiers away or to injure civilians, which is what it's most commonly used for. That's why that's a war crime in most countries. It's same thing with nuclear weapons. They should be war crimes, but unfortunately, they aren't, and that needs to change.",

If a threat is detected, the Iron Dome launches an interceptor missile to neutralize the rocket in mid-air, far from its target. This system has shown remarkable effectiveness, reportedly intercepting over 90% of targeted threats.

Head on, here is how it looks. First Russia occupied Crimea, with its shipyards, airfields and seaports. From there it is projecting its military power onto the Mediterranean in the Middle East. Even before the full-scale invasion, the Russian fleet started a hybrid war with NATO. It closed strips of the Black Sea for navigation, disrupting NATO exercises, sea breeze and agile spirit. And after the full-scale invasion, it only got worse. Russia blockaded Ukrainian ports. Its jets disrupted an American surveillance drug flying in international airspace. Its naval infantry boarded a merchant vessel in international waters. This is piracy, pure and simple. Russia is constantly violating the United Nations Charter and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It poses a danger for Ukraine and all its neighbors.

He led the state-owned oil company, Rosniyft, to produce 40% of Russia's total oil while controlling more than half of the company's shares. Similarly, the Russian state also controls more than half of the shares in Gazprom, the largest company in Russia that produces more than 12% of the entire world's natural gas supply. The CEOs of both companies are longtime friends of Putin dating back to the 1990s before he assumed the presidency. And unlike his immediate predecessors of the 1990s, Putin was incredibly fortunate because the international prices of oil and gas began to skyrocket shortly after he assumed office, and Russian financial power was once again on the upswing alongside it. In 2000, when Putin first took office in 2012, the value of Russia's annual oil and gas exports increased by around 7 fold. From only $53 billion in 2000 to $351 billion in 2012. Consequently, Putin used these funds to dramatically increase the annual budget of the Russian military by nearly 9 fold, from just $9.2 billion to $81.4 billion over that same time period. In addition to paying off the Soviet Union's entire outstanding debt and freeing up his ambitions across the rest of the post-Soviet world, outside of Central Asia, one of the biggest problems for Putin's goals were the old Soviet-era pipeline networks that took Russia's hydrocarbon resources to market in Europe.

Generally what she said was correct, but there are two things that like, rub me the wrong way. One was just like kind of misleading the other one is like dangerous for Black people that want to travel to Russia. The misleading one is simple. Yes, technically Zareniklis I said that there will be no trading of African bodies in Russia, because it's a moral. But Russia had the system of Serfdom, which was like their equivalent of slavery. So saying that the West European structure of slavery is immoral while upholding Serfdom is in and of itself problematic. So that was misleading. Second and more importantly, she said that if you are Black, nothing bad will happen to you in Russia. People will just want to talk to you and want to take pictures with you. And that is sometimes true, but more often than not very untrue. Sometimes people will want to know where you're from, especially if you speak Russian, because just as she said, a lot of people from Russia have never met a Black person in real life. And so they will want to know where you're from, where you're in Russia, if you speak Russian, so on and so forth. But more often than not, and this is reflective of my experience and the Black people that I have met in Russia, it is very dangerous for us to be in these spaces. I personally have been followed, I've been attacked, I've been choked, I've been spit on, I've been hit. Many things have happened to me as I'm living my life just walking down the street or sitting in a restaurant. And same thing usually worse to other Black people that I've met, especially if they are darker skin than I am. But this idea among White Russians that Black people won't have a problem in Russia is very pervasive. A lot of White Russians think that and oftentimes it comes from the fact that in Russian history, because they had surfed them not slavery and they didn't colonize Africa, race was not formalized in the same way that it was in much of Western Europe and North America. Therefore, the conception of race and racism, as we know it in the West, don't exist in Russia. But just because the conception does not exist does not mean that racism does not exist. I've had the privilege to live and visit many different countries and I will say that the worst racism I've ever experienced in my entire life, aside from Italy, is Russia. And just a quick rule of thumb if you're ever wondering what it's like to be a minority in a different country, listen to the minorities not the White people.",

About half of the region is blanked and pine forest. The trees seem to continue endlessly, and you can go days without seeing any sign of human life. The land here is also very flat, causing murky bogs and swamps to develop. Winter's are known to be harsh. From December to March, temperatures can dip well below freezing. These nations are some of the wildest regions in Europe, as well as the least populated. People have lived in the Baltics for millennia, mostly in networks of loosely connected tribes. Until the Middle Ages, they had little contact with the outside world. As a result, Christianity was the last to reach them. Starting in the 12th century, the Church launched a great northern crusade and brought Christianity into the region through violence and warfare. After the brutal conflict and the shedding of much innocent blood, many natives renounced their religion in favour of Christianity. Others, however, held on to their ancestral beliefs and continued to worship the old gods in secret.",

Here are five things you need to know about refugees and global displacement from UNHCR's latest global transfer for. One, today there are over 110 million displaced people around the world. Last year the number of people forced to flee conflict, violence and human rights violations grew by 21 percent. This marks the largest increase in a single year in UNHCR's history. Two, in 2022 52 percent of displaced people in need of international protection came from just three countries, Syria, Ukraine and Afghanistan. In fact Syrian refugees make up the largest group of refugees around the world with over 6.5 million of them living across 131 countries. Three, the majority of forcibly displaced people are hosted in neighboring or low- and middle-income countries. 70 percent of refugees are living in neighboring countries and the staggering 76 percent of refugees are living in low and middle-income countries. Four, children are disproportionately impacted by forced displacement. In 2022 children made up 41 percent of the world's forcibly displaced population even though children only make up 30 percent of the world's population. Over the last four years more than 1.9 million children have been born as refugees. Five, last year we saw the highest number of new asylum applications ever on record. In 2022 2.6 million new asylum applications were filed from over 140 nationalities across 155 countries. Latin American and Caribbean nationals made up over 40 percent of the applications with the US receiving the highest number of applications at 730,400.

459,@alexhollings52_video_7267300997293149482.txt," Let's talk about the time Wagner Group mercenaries attacked US Special Operations Forces, outnumbered and outgunned them, and then were hung out to drive by the Russian government after they lost the battle. On February 7th of 2018, a small detachment of around 40 US Special Operations troops, mostly hailing from Special Forces and Delta Force, were holed up in the Kanoco gas plant in Syria. Now that gas plant was on the Syrian Democratic Forces controlled side of the Euphrates River, and during the day Russian forces began massing about two miles away under the guise of a training exercise. But at just about 10.30 pm, they launched their assault behind a hail of artillery mortar and 125 millimeter tank fire. Now the Russian force was comprised of more than 500 Wagner Group mercenaries and Syrian soldiers, supported by two dozen or more armored vehicles, and at least 10, T-55 and T-72 tanks. On the other side, the American Special Operators were dug in, but they had no heavy weapons. They were armed only with small arms, including rifles and machine guns. About 20 miles away, they had a quick reaction force positioned with five more armored vehicles armed with 50 caliber machine guns, and a small group of Syrian Democratic Forces for support. Now at 10.30 pm, when the Russian forces launched their attack, they didn't start by advancing. They were happy just to bombard the area with artillery, tank and mortar fire. But that gave the quick reaction force an opportunity to get there. However, all of the Syrian Democratic Forces fled when they saw the level of fighting ahead of them. So by the time the QRF team arrived, it was made up of only five armored vehicles and 10 US Special Forces green berets. They quickly joined in on the fight, holding back the Russian offensive. After three hours of heavy fighting, the Wagner group forces had closed within just 300 meters of the American position, and the American Special Operators had literally nothing they could do to stop the advancing tanks. Even the most highly trained Special Operator in the world can't stop a tank column with a rifle. But just when all seemed lost, US air power arrived in the form of just about every tactical aircraft in the region, including B-52s, AC-130 gunships, AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, MQ-9 Reaper drones, F-15E, strike eagles, and even the F-22 Raptor. When the dust had settled after a 45-minute air-powered bombardment, not a single US troop had been injured. One Syrian Democratic Forces soldier fighting with them did get minor injuries, but the death toll on the other side was palpable. The lowest estimates out of Syria are better than 50. The highest estimates are more than 300. And according to one Wagner group mercenary who participated in the battle and was recorded discussing it later, it was at least 220 or so, including every armored vehicle except for one being destroyed. For their part, the Russian government still denies any hand in this operation, even though it was later revealed that Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime had actually offered Russian officials and the Wagner group in particular a 25% commission on the proceeds of that natural gas plant once it was up and running again. In other words, the Wagner group and Russian officials in Syria legitimately risked open war between nuclear powers at best and World War III at worst over a 25% commission on a natural gas refinery. Now this is a massive story, and over the past few weeks I have been pouring over primary sources. First hand accounts from the special operators who participated in the battle, as well as audio recordings from Wagner group mercenaries who also participated in the battle. And I've compiled what may be the most thorough recounting of events that has been published online yet. It'll be up pretty soon on sandbox news and it'll be followed by a full video that I'll post on YouTube.",

If you don't want vote the way I want, don't forget that you have an account in an American bank. Don't forget that your son is studying in an American university. I'm not joking. I have some friends who have been suffering from this kind of treatment. But the key issue is the United Nations chatter. It says the United Nations is based on the principle of sovereign equality of states. Analyze what the Americans are doing all over the world. And you will immediately come to the conclusion that they don't give a damn to respecting this principle. But many countries are accusing Russia of abandoning their charter by invading or sending forces inside an independent recognized state, which is the Ukraine and a member of the United Nations. You believe that the Americans were right to go in Iraq, to go in Syria, to bomb Libya. Two wrongs don't make a choice. No, no, no, no.

470,@returnmediadaily_video_7220599074792410414.txt," On this day in history, April 10, 1972, the United States and the Soviet Union signed the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, Salt One, a landmark agreement aimed at reducing the number of nuclear weapons in their respective arsenals. The signing of Salt One was the result of years of diplomatic negotiations and represented a critical step towards easing tensions between the two superpowers during the Cold War. The events leading up to the signing of Salt One can be traced back to the late 1960s, when the United States and the Soviet Union began engaging in talks on arms control. In 1969, President Richard Nixon and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev initiated negotiations on limiting the arms race, recognizing the need to avoid a costly and dangerous nuclear arms race. These negotiations culminated in May 1971 with the signing of the Strategic Arms Limitation talks, Salt, Agreement, which laid the groundwork for Salt One. The formal negotiations for Salt One began in November 1971 with both sides engaging in intense discussions on various aspects of arms control, including limiting the number of strategic ballistic missiles, anti-ballistic missile systems, and underground nuclear testing. The talks were complex and contentious, with both sides seeking to protect their respective national interests while also striving for mutually beneficial outcome. After months of negotiations, on May 26, 1972, President Nixon and General Secretary Brezhnev signed the One-Shilling Agreement in Moscow. The treaty consisted of two main parts. The Anti-ballistic Missile, ABM, Treaty and the Interim Agreement on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. The ABM Treaty limited the deployment of anti-ballistic missile systems, while the Interim Agreement placed limits on the number of strategic ballistic missiles that each side could possess. The signing of Salt One was met with global claim as it was seen as a significant step towards reducing the arms race and promoting global stability. Many countries, including U.S. allies in Europe, welcomed the treaty as a positive development in the effort to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. However, the treaty was not without its critics. Some conservatives in the United States argued that it did not go far enough in addressing the Soviet threat, and that it would leave the U.S. at a strategic disadvantage. Nevertheless, the treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate in August 1972, demonstrating a broad consensus for arms control among U.S. policy makers. In the years following the signing of Salt One, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union took steps to implement the treaty. They engaged in regular consultations and inspections to ensure compliance, and the treaty was seen as a positive step in improving U.S. Soviet relations. However, the positive momentum of Salt One was ultimately challenged by geopolitical developments. In 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, leading to increased tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The subsequent deterioration of relations between the two countries led to a freezing further arms control negotiations and an eventual breakdown of Salt One. Despite its eventual demise, Salt One remains a significant milestone in arms control history. It demonstrated that diplomacy and negotiations could be effective in addressing the dangers of nuclear weapons and reducing the risk of an all-out nuclear war. It also set the stage for future arms control talks between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, leading to the signing of the follow-up treaty, Salt Two, in 1979. So it was never ratified. The strategic arms limitation treaty had several significant long-term implications. First, it established a precedent for arms control diplomacy between the two superpowers, showing that negotiation and dialogue were possible despite ideological differences. Second, it contributed to the stable asation of the strategic balance between the United States and the Soviet Union by capping the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles each country could deploy. Third, Salt One included confidence-building measures such as Darduk's changes and verification procedures that promoted transparency and trust between the two countries. Fourth, Salt One had a broader impact on global geopolitics, setting the stage for future arms control negotiations and influencing subsequent agreements like Salt Two and the Intermediate Change Nuclear Forces Treaty. Finally, while facing criticisms and limitations, Salt One is considered a significant milestone in arms control efforts during the Cold War era, with its legacy continuing to shape international relations and arms control efforts today.",

Here are key features and details about the THAD Interception Range. THAD is designed to intercept missiles at altitudes, exceeding the Earth's atmosphere during their terminal descending phase of flight. This capability provides a broader defense against various ballistic missile threats. THAD is equipped with a powerful X-band radar and TPI-2 that provides target tracking and discrimination capabilities. Interceptor missiles, the system uses the TAD interceptor, which is designed to destroy incoming missiles through kinetic energy impact. Fire control system, the Fire Control System, coordinates radar data, interceptor launch, and target engagement. Mobility, THAD is highly mobile and transportable. It can be quickly deployed to different locations to provide protection against missile threats. The United States has deployed THAD systems in various locations globally, including South Korea, Guam, and the United Arab Emirates. These deployments are intended to enhance regional missile defense capabilities. THAD is operated by the US Army and is part of the broader missile defense architecture. It is integrated into the missile defense agencies MDA, ballistic missile defense system, BMDS. THAD is often used in conjunction with other missile defense systems, such as the Aegis ballistic missile defense, BMDS system, to provide a multi-layered defense against different types of missile threats. The TAD system has undergone extensive testing to demonstrate its capabilities. TEST scenarios include intercepting ballistic missiles at various ranges and altitudes. The US has worked with allies to integrate THAD into their defense architectures. For example, the deployment of THAD in South Korea is aimed at enhancing regional defense capabilities against North Korean missile threats. The deployment of THAD in certain regions has been a source of controversy, leading to geopolitical tensions. Issues such as sovereignty concerns and potential impacts on regional security have been raised in some instances. THAD continues to undergo improvements and upgrades to address emerging threats and enhance overall performance. The system is part of a dynamic and evolving field of missile defense technologies. THAD is a crucial component of the broader missile defense strategy employed by the United States and its allies to counter ballistic missile threats as with any military technology, developments and deployments may evolve.",objective

I try not to get sentimental online, but let me explain why I religiously watched him's videos. I'm from Ukraine and in 2014 I lost my home. Back then I was 16 years old and my dad was actually around the same age as Tim right now. When we still lived in Lohansk my mom used to film absolutely everything. She would film my fights with my sisters, she would film all of the playtime, all of the vacations, we had thousands of videos. When we left our home and we started rebuilding, we lost so many things. My parents lost the business which they've been building for 30 years, we lost our house, we lost our dogs. And the thing which I'm still thinking about today is that we lost those videos. I was so confident that one day I will show them to my grandkids. I wanted not to only capture those moments in my head but I wanted to relieve them and share those happy moments with my family. Ever since 2014 I never felt like home. I lived in amazing places and I've been so privileged to experience those amazing places but I never felt like home. And watching his videos is the closest thing I feel to home because it's this happy feeling which I never experienced since that time. Guys my zodiac sign is cancer that's why I'm like so sentimental the only zodiac sign which is cold after a disease. But I also want to point out that the way people see Ukraine right now is really not who we were. We were simple people who had our big and small dreams. We were enjoying the small things and then we lost the opportunity to enjoy the moment because the only thought in your mind became how do I survive and how do I make sure that my family as well. So I want to thank Tim for making me feel like home when I'm far away from one.

As we know, NATO is a defensive alliance that protects the US, Canada and Europe. An attack on one country is considered an attack on all. In the lead up to Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, he complained about NATO expansion in Europe as more and more countries sought membership. But ironically, Putin's now got more of exactly what he didn't want. Before Putin's invasion of Ukraine, about a quarter of Fin's supported NATO membership. After Putin launched his war, that surged to almost 80 percent. And Finland has its own history with Moscow. It was invaded by the Soviet Union back in 1939. The bottom line is that NATO has now expanded even further. Russia will now share a border with a NATO member more than 800 miles long. While next door, Sweden is also seeking to join the alliance.

The Stinger manpad, a veteran of the Soviet Afghan War, was deployed again almost a year ago to fight the Russians. And since then, the Russians have learned to fear and respect this weapon system so much that they sent one of the captured Stinger missiles to Iran through a verse engineering. This is Military Mechanics and in this episode we will talk about the FIM-92 Stinger. This video is brought to you by Duovox Ultra, a military-grade night vision monocular with full-color starlight technology. It delivers sharp, full-color real-time night vision with as little as 0.001 lumens of visible light. If it's built-in high-capacity IR illuminator, you can even see through complete darkness. Its impressive 5x optical and 10x digital zoom paired with manual focus mode lets you get up close to observing objects. Click on the link in the description to buy the Duovox Ultra and ensure crystal clear night vision. The Stinger missile, formerly known as the FIM-92, was developed by the United States as a shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile system. The Stinger's primary purpose is to provide infantry units with a highly portable and effective means to engage and destroy enemy aircraft. As a result, it has played a significant role in the evolution of modern warfare, enabling smaller forces to challenge the air superiority of their adversaries. The development of the Stinger missile began in the late 1960s, prompted by the need for a more advanced and effective portable surface-to-air missile system. The US Army awarded the contract for the design and production of the Stinger to General Dynamics in 1972. To receive the test, the missile-ended service in 1981, replacing the less effective red-eye missile system. The Stinger missile system has undergone multiple upgrades and improvements since its introduction in 1981. It consists of three primary components, the missile itself, the launch tube, and the identification friend or foe, IFF, interrogator. The missile has a length of 1.52 meters, a diameter of 2.8 inches, and fins measuring 3.9 inches. The weight of the missile itself is approximately 22 pounds, while the total weight of the missile, including its launch tube, integral sight, grip stock, and identification friend or foe, IFF, antenna, is approximately 34 pounds. It can engage low altitude enemy threats up to 2.36 miles away and has a targeting range of up to 2.98 miles. The Stinger is propelled away from the operator by a small ejection motor before the main two-stage solid fuel sustainer is engaged. This causes the Stinger to accelerate to a maximum speed of Mach 2.54. The missile's high explosive annular blast fragmentation, or HEA-BF, Warhead, is designed to maximize damage to aircraft by targeting the most vulnerable components, such as engines, fuel tanks, and control surfaces. The Warhead has 2.25 pounds of HTA-3 explosive, which is a mixture of HMX, TNT, and aluminum powder. Additionally, the Warhead has an impact fuse and a self-destruct timer that goes off 17 seconds after launch. Also, the Stinger missile features a proximity fuse that detonates the Warhead when it comes with an predetermined distance of the targets. This increases the likelihood of damaging or destroying the target, even if the missile does not score a direct hit. The FIM-92J's proximity fuse has been upgraded for greater reliability and effectiveness. Stinger is guided by an infrared passive system. The Seeker has the ability to focus on moving as well as stationary targets. There have been upgrades to both the Seeker and the computer. The FIM-92B and later models use a Seeker that detects both infrared and ultraviolet lights. The FIM-92K makes use of a data link to enable a remote sensor to acquire a target outside of the Stinger's sensors acquisition range. Using the data link, the missile is able to make mid-air adjustments to its course and successfully acquire the target. One of the key advantages of the Stinger missile is its user use. The entire system weighs approximately 35 pounds, making it highly portable and suitable for infantry use. The launch process is straightforward and requires minimal training further enhancing its usability. Additionally, the IFF interrogation helps prevent friendly fire incidents by ensuring that the missile only engages enemy aircraft. Throughout the Stinger's deployments, there have been multiple barriers within pre-hills in ranged guidance and reality. Some of these include the FIM-92A basic Stinger. FIM-92B Stinger post, FIM-92C Stinger RMP, FIM-92D Stinger block 1, and the FIM-92J, which features an improved Seeker that allows for better target acquisition in adverse weather conditions and increased resistance to countermeasures. A single Stinger missile costs around 134,488 dollars. Adjusted to 25.",subjective

While the Russian Defense Ministry doesn't say the ship was destroyed, but does admit it was damaged in the Ukrainian attack, a Russian appointed official in Crimea says one person was killed and two others injured in that strike. If the ship was indeed destroyed, this would be the third major military hardware loss for Russia in less than a week. You can see from the explosion that it was loaded with ammunition. A lot of those are secondary explosions. I mean, that's quite significant. Russia still has the law of large numbers.

This concluded action was necessary and proportionate. It was precise and only targeted military objectives and carried out carefully to minimize the potential for escalation and prevent civilian harm. Madam President, we thank those members of the Council who condemned the Israeli armed attack against our diplomatic premises in Syria. The Great Template in this chamber, a certain member of the Council, including the US, UK and France, has chosen once again to turn a blind eye to reality and overlook the root causes contributing to the current situation. In hypocritical behavior, these three countries falsely blamed and accused Iran without considering their own failures to uphold the international commitment to peace and security in the region. They made unsurcessful attempts to use lies, manipulate, generate, spread this information and engage in a destructive blame game. All the while, they deliberately disregarded Iran's inherent right to respond to the violation of a fundamental principle of international law, the inviolability of diplomatic representative and premises. Moreover, they ignored the underlying root causes of the current situation in the region. For our six months now, these countries, especially the United States, have shielded Israeli from any responsibility for the gas they massacre. While they have denied Iran's inherent right to self-defense against the Israeli armed attack on our diplomatic premises, at the same time, they shamefully justified the Israeli massacre and genocide against the defense force Palestinian people on the deputakes of self-defense. They made cynical attempt to justify and cover up the atrocities of the Israeli regime against the people of Palestine by arbitrary and misleading interpretation of self-defense. Madame President, following the Israeli regime, covertly terrorist and armed attack against our diplomatic premises in Damascus, the Syrian Arab Republic. In the first of April, we notified the UN Security Council and Secretary General of such international, wrongful act, as well as of Iran's inherent right on the international law to respond to such terrorist armed attack.",subjective

Like when I was 11, I left my hometown never to return again. When the first bomb dropped I looked at my mom, asked her to play that CD because those were things I saw in Hollywood films and just like that little girl scream. I felt her living in me but I had lost my voice because I was too scared. So I died in silence while my stomach made the noise. It was never a feeling of butterflies because there was no lover at sight. It was rather a serious case of diarrhea instigated by thoughts of buns of lost hopes. How for some tomorrow may never come so those dreams got buried by the sounds of guns. We didn't see it coming. He came with a smile, said, peace be unto you but that was his way of saying, I am about to split families into pieces. I am here to take away your peace. They continue with what of my deen that I hold. Like the sky holds the moon, like the womb bears the baby, like the heart carries love yet I stand no chance to save or defend it because the media show cases saying this is who we are. Like the Atlantic tells the story of the Pacific yet somehow never found its way into it but this representation is because we never showed up, no spoke up so this is me showing up. My name is Alhan. I am a Muslim, an indigent of Bernostate, a citizen of Nigeria, a daughter of Africa, a place rich in culture where thousands have fallen in Bama, where a girl in Chibok dreams of highest aspirations yet cut short because before she could get home from school they were taken some never to return, channels to heart labor, learning to labor before the womb took form, turned to time bombs, a place where we share home with soldiers like the pyramids and the sand in the desert of Egypt we have nothing but each other. A place where terrorists take up words of my deen to kill but I reject because in this heart is a border, you can't cross over because that is not what a Muslim does. A place where home is like an eclipse yet somehow the moon separates itself from the sun so we see a new day. Somehow through the noise and the smile and the eyes of the kids on the street we see a ray, a spark. So we say rest in peace to the souls that we have lost and despite the fall and what may come. This is us showing up, holding firm to the mountains and our names, to the valley on which the foundation of our humanity lies. So I want to thank my knee on days it trembles but the cap locked today so I still straight even on days I was meant to fall. And just like that, Burno will never fall in. Inshallah. Thank you.

So the new one now, the second piece is dedicated to the daughters and sons of Africa and this is a very beautiful gathering because it brings together the sons and daughters of Africa. I was speaking to the last of my friend who is the king and I met her here yesterday and we were talking about how we can resuscitate the cold spirit of grace and glory for the black continent and I showed at this poem and she said you just have to do it and so here goes Ignite Africa. Once upon a time I said to an old man I am not good enough. The cold has settled in. There is no warmth in my continent. He gazed at me and remarked I am a citizen of every country. Every country? Yes. Every country. Birthed by a mother so divine. She is a mother with no borders. Mama Africa. She has 54 children and in each where warriors who became legends, who never crossed over. Though they are gone, their names are left over. Like that food in the morning that fills you up, yet reminds you of the lingers of the night. Manifestations of victory. Names are walls that time fears. When it runs out, they still remain. They ignited Africa. There were lions and you my darling, Araqab. He said, dear great-granddaughter of a mother so flaming, a continent with indelible resources but of it all, you are its greatest asset. Your scheme, proposition and ideas, if you dare, we resuscitate the cold spirit of grace and glory for the black continent. You will create a prosperous African community whose sustainable development will be you driven. Yes you. Because you are Africa's biggest capital, greatest asset. You see, the color of your scheme doesn't mean the color of your brain. It is but a great lining to conserve the light that you possess. Your passion is excellence-on-refined. Your gold or mind, its diamond-on-exploded, this may not and bring it raw. That is the only way to your inner-enor-enchroned-cullion heart. Dear blazing, glistening lustrous dazzling child of Africa. You are a tune from your grandfather's flute. You are the sweat from your mother's labour. You are the representation of love, a pledge of loyalty that sprung off tons and body languages. You are a saccharite covenant forever bind in ties of two familiar strangers, land, borders and boundaries. You are the fulfilled promise that sprung off conversations of your ancestors that ended with smirks and laughs. You are the supernatural phenomena. They spoke of beating their chests. You are the cup of a lion. Bravely is in your bloodline. So if you ever feel like you, your ideas are not good enough. Remember, all you have to do is roar when the cold settles in on your mother, our mother, Mama Africa, remember within you is enough fire to ignite Africa. Thank you.",subjective

It's called United for Ukraine program. It's not a status. It's some really limited stuff. Like, we can be here. We get access to in during two years. But we have only two years. And it's like a shelter. Temporary shelter for Ukrainians, which is always will be appreciated for United States to give us those opportunities to have a safe place being. And of course, there is a noble question. What's next? What we should do next? And for us, it's the biggest question. We didn't know for sure before. We was just, you know, the life before America was unpredictable, implanable. I hope you don't even understand what was the life for us during all those couple years of war. It's tough. But idea is we need to stop the war. Making, start making plans. So we decide, like I decide my family, we want to stay. To be honest, I'm not going to keep something under lines. To be honest, we want to stay here and live here longer after those two years. Because I can see here future for my family, for my child. It she can grow and get what she deserves. I mean, she can be able to choose the job what she liked, the study, which we don't have before. And a lot of factors get summary that I want to stay. This is like, and to be, to make it, it's hard. I spent yesterday and holding it. And I sleep, I get it, research, like how we can stay here. And answers was difficult. It's not easy stuff. It's not easy to do. No, but there are some options. And in the end, I understand that only one options I get to stay here in the United States legal. To get the green card, then citizen all this immigration formalities. And it's not options at all. I mean, there are some. But what we can have and what is affordable for us and what we can do, probably on the one or two, actually, for a whole list. And what we have is only job, eB3, WIZA. It's like work employment green cards called something like this, eB3, it's called. What do we need for that? It's quite important because when I understand that, I really now know that I need to focus on it now. For this moment, from today, I need to give the dreams for the back, all what I speak before, like what I get, what my heart's listening. And I need to choose, really choose. If I want to stay in the United States, I need to work on it. So the base requirements for those green card employment in B3 is that I need to have a work like two years experience or study in some sphere, let's say, and I understand that I need to have a job and it should be not just a job. It's need to be a job where I am unreplaceable person. And the employee, some company, need to prove it. It's not hard for employees. They will need to run some process. It will cost $700. But the company need really have me as an important person, important worker. And it's not just a simple job. It's need something where I can grow and where I can be really helpful and useful. And this is very important for us now because two years, I need to be there. Two years, I need to work in some company. And then they will be possible to make for me those. And this is a line for us now. We will change, not a change, just refresh the plants, understand where we are and understand what we're looking for. And it is really some company. It can be not any, it just needs to be like a big company, which I can work and grow. So this is a conclusion what I get for three months in America. It's a beautiful, wonderful place where we can and once then to stay for a long time. I want to come back in Ukraine one day, for sure, but as a tourist, like to remember and to see my old friends and my hometown. But for do that, for now, what the focus is, I need to find the company where I can work, grow, became really neat and I will work hard for that company because I understand it's for my family now, what I need to do, not just the made money. It's not enough. It will not help me to stay here. And I will do that. This is my plan and I will use all the resources, advices if you guys have any advices. But what company can be, what job can be because, yeah, I come here in Florida and see all those opportunities, but all of this is great. But it will not help me to start my this employment career. That's what I need now to work hard for some company and do the best. And then this company will see my results, the type of work hard and help me to make those green cards. This is it. I was trying to make this video for me also to keep all stuff in the line, all the opportunity. And now I know where to go. I will be very happy if you start commenting and I will see your feedback for this. Thank you so much. Who saw video until then, love you.",subjective

This agreement is known as Article 5 of the New York Treaty. In fact there's 14 articles in total that members must agree to, but Article 5 is the real crux of NATO. The alliance was created in 1949 shortly after World War II by the Western allies and some of their friends. Today NATO has 30 members although that member may soon grow to 32 as Finland and Sweden have recently asked to join the alliance. While NATO does have two North American members, new membership is only available to European countries who are democratic, stable and just generally not jerks to other countries.

88,@interestingengineering_video_7270524858197380358.txt," A few months prior, the US and Germany supplied Ukraine the Patriot weapon system. The most expensive weapon system contribution as an estimated cost of 1.1 billion dollars each. On May 16th, shortly after becoming operational, one of Ukraine's Patriot batteries near Kiev identified over a dozen incoming Russian missiles, including six Kingjars from approximately 125 miles away. All were intercepted, the last one being just 9 miles else. Following that incident, Ukraine has claimed to have intercepted Kingjal missiles on three further occasions. Clearly, Russia is actively seeking the Patriot batteries to eliminate them. However, in a setback for them, Germany announced an early August 2023 that it had delivered two more Patriot systems to Ukraine. Patriot is an acronym for phased array tracking radar for intercept on target, the main government or his previously known as SAMD. It was first deployed in the 1980s and quickly became a key component of US power projection, as well as a premier symbol of US commitment to allies and partners. Despite being among the world's top tier systems, the Patriot batteries are identifiable due to their distinct radar frequencies, which Russia can detect and target with its advanced missiles. Each Patriot battery is a noticeable presence on battlefield and they lack the mobility seen in some of Ukraine's more agile defense systems. While Russia claims to have disabled a Patriot system near Kiev with the Kingjal, US reports counter that the system was only damaged, not fully destroyed. The Kingjal Russian for Dagun and dubbed Kilroy by NATO is a sophisticated Russian missile system. The missile boasts a range of 932 to 1242 miles and can carry a 158 pound payload, where the nuclear or conventional. Upon launch, it swiftly accelerates to Mach 4 and might even reach speeds of Mach 10. Though Kingjal achieves impressive speeds, possibly even surpassing some labeled hypersonic weapons, it doesn't sustain this speed throughout its journey. Still, its combination of velocity, erratic movement and agility make it a formidable challenge for defense systems. In a battle of technological titles, the US Patriot system finds its match in Russia's advanced Kingjal missile, as the capabilities of the Patriot system are likely stretched to their limits by this weapon system.",subjective

To de-escalate this, they did a lot of stuff, but one of the things that it was signed this treaty that basically said like, let's not test nuclear weapons, which would provoke each other to like want to ratchet up how many we each have.

95,@reallifelore_video_7106011305420541226.txt," That Vladimir Putin came to power as the president of Russia in May of 2000. Just over eight years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and he certainly understood even back then, the immense power that oil and gas could give the Russian state. Although allegedly highly plagiarized, he wrote his doctoral thesis at the St. Petersburg Mining University in 1997. And after assuming the presidency, Putin began running the Russian Federation much like the CEO of an energy company would. Thus it's far more helpful to think of modern Russia as more of an energy company that happens to also control a huge state armed with nuclear weapons. He led the state-owned oil company, Rosniyft, to produce 40% of Russia's total oil while controlling more than half of the company's shares. Similarly, the Russian state also controls more than half of the shares in Gazprom, the largest company in Russia that produces more than 12% of the entire world's natural gas supply. The CEOs of both companies are longtime friends of Putin dating back to the 1990s before he assumed the presidency. And unlike his immediate predecessors of the 1990s, Putin was incredibly fortunate because the international prices of oil and gas began to skyrocket shortly after he assumed office. And Russian financial power was once again on the upswing alongside it. Between 2000 when Putin first took office in 2012, the value of Russia's annual oil and gas exports increased by around 7 fold. From only $53 billion in 2000 to $351 billion in 2012. Consequently, Putin used these funds to dramatically increase the annual budget of the Russian military by nearly 9 fold, from just $9.2 billion to $81.4 billion over that same time period. In addition to paying off the Soviet Union's entire outstanding debt and freeing up his ambitions across the rest of the post-Soviet world, outside of Central Asia. One of the biggest problems for Putin's goals were the old Soviet-era pipeline networks that took Russia's hydrocarbon resources to market in Europe. The Brotherhood Network through Ukraine and the Northern Lights Network through Belarus. Belarus remained an effective puppet state of the Kremlin, and so the Northern Lights Network wasn't very troubling, but Ukraine was very different. As late as 2005, 80% of Russia's oil and gas exports to Europe were still all concentrated through the Brotherhood Network across Ukraine, because that network simply had the highest capacity at the time. None of this mattered when Ukraine and Russia were all part of the same country, but now that they weren't, it mattered a ton, and it began mattering even more after 2005. Following Ukraine's orange revolution and the rise to power of the pro-Western Victor Yushchenko as president. Russia demanded that Ukraine transfer the ownership over the entire Brotherhood pipeline network to them, which was staunchly refused by Yushchenko's new pro-Western government. At the same time, Ukraine still relied on Russian natural gas imports for most of their own consumption as well, and twice during the winners of 2006 and 2009, Russia strategically penalized Ukraine and applied political pressure by temporarily cutting off their gas supplies exactly when they needed them the most. And in both instances, Moscow accused the Ukrainians of siphoning off gas traveling through the pipes that was intended for Europe. In the eyes of Moscow, Ukraine was becoming an unreliable bridge for their pipelines to Europe, and alternative routes began to be constructed. Like Yomal, Thurbelleres and Poland, Turkstream and Bluestream beneath the Black Sea directly to Turkey, and most controversially of all, Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 at the cost of $10 billion billion each, respectively, beneath the Baltic Sea, feeding directly to Germany. Russia's single largest oil and gas customer, and Germany was only increasing their dependence. In 2011, after a tsunami struck the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan, and sparked the world's biggest nuclear disaster since Chernobyl, the German government took the decision to gradually phase out all 17 of their own nuclear reactors that, in 2011, produced a quarter of Germany's entire electricity. The final three were theoretically scheduled to come offline at the end of 2022. And to make up the difference, Germany began importing even more gas from Russia, increasing the value of Moscow's leverage over them. By 2010, the Ukrainian president was no longer the pro-Western Viktor Yushchenko, but the pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych. And this was important, because huge discoveries were just being made at the time by various energy companies that suddenly showed Ukraine had proven natural gas reserves of 1.1 trillion cubic meters, and they could potentially be as high as 5.4 trillion cubic meters. Largely focused in rich geological deposits around offshore Crimea, the Sea of Azav, the Western Carpathians, and the Danyapur-Dunyutsk Rift in the northeast, where more than 80 percent of those 1.1 trillion cubic meters worth of proven reserves were located. These discoveries in the early 2010s suddenly revealed that Ukraine held the second largest known proven reserves of natural gas in Europe, only behind Norway's 1.53 trillion cubic meters. Through a long series of gas pipelines stretching across the North Sea to Europe, Norway has used those reserves to become the second largest exporter of gas to Europe only after Russia, and provides roughly 19 percent of the EU's total supply. So, Ukraine, with potentially as much as 3.5 times more natural gas than Norway, and with one of the world's largest pipeline networks from the Soviet era already built out across the country directly towards Europe, could have easily all of a sudden become an enormous provider of natural gas to Europe and cut tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars into Russia's biggest market. Moreover, Ukraine's gas infrastructure also includes storage sites capable of holding more than 31 billion cubic meters worth of gas, and they have been severely underutilized for decades. The entire European Union can currently only store 100 billion cubic meters, and thus, if Ukraine were to ever join the EU, they would increase their gas stored capabilities by a third, and thus severely reduce the ability of Moscow to pressure European governments during the winter, precisely when they need their gas the most. The only problems for Ukraine at the time were that they didn't have the technology or the equipment to really go after any of these reserves, and their president at the time was closely aligned with the Kremlin, so the fear in Moscow was not yet on high alert. But those problems were being rapidly solved. In September of 2011, the Ukrainian government signed a deal with Exxon mobile to explore shale gas reserves across the country. In January 2013, they signed another deal worth $10 billion with Shell to explore the Yuzifska gas field in the Donbass, and later on that same year in November, they signed another $10 billion deal with Chevron to explore the fields in the far west near the Carpathians. Western energy companies were rapidly moving into unlock Ukraine's natural gas potential just as they had around the Kaspian Sea a decade previously, and then all of a sudden early on in February of the next year in 2014, Ukraine itself underwent an enormous pro-Western political revolution. The pro-Russian Ukrainian president at the time set to sign an association agreement with the European Union, suddenly declined at the last moment, paid for by a last minute offer for 30% cheaper gas prices to his country and a $15 billion aid package. Kiev erupted in revolution. Yonukovych's regime was toppled as he fled to Russia, and a new, very pro-Western regime rose to power in the",subjective

The THAT Interceptor missile has a single-stage solid fuel rocket booster that can reach a peak speed of about 2.6 kilometers per second, about 8 times the speed of sound. Here's how THAT, formerly the Terminal High-Outitude Area Defense, works as laid out by Lockheed Martin. Radar to Texan coming threat. Target is identified and engaged. Interceptor is fired from truck mounted launcher. Interceptor uses kinetic energy to destroy incoming missile. THAT has a unique capability to destroy threats in both the endo and exo-admosphere. THAT is effective against all types of ballistic missile warheads, especially including weapons of mass destruction payloads. THAT was specifically designed to counter mass rage with its high firepower up to 72 interceptors per battery. Capable organic radar and powerful battle manager fire control capability.

THAT is mobile and rapidly deployable, which provides warfighters with greater flexibility to adapt to changing threat situations around the globe. There's tremendous concern over Russian and Chinese ballistic missile systems. How does THAT stack up against such potential systems? The global proliferation of threat ballistic missile systems coupled with significant advances in precision, lethality, and exploitation of unprotected battle space requires a multi-tier layer defense. To effectively defend troops, citizens, infrastructure, and critical assets from these growing threats, THAT's unique endo and exo capability adds essential layers of defense because it can operate in both regimes. THAT complements existing ballistic missile defenses by closing the battle space gap between endo-only Patriot-Pak 3 and exo-only Aegis ballistic missile defense. THAT is interoperable with all ballistic missile defense system elements and provides an exceptional capability to defend against mass raids, a challenge for many ballistic missile defense systems. HISTORY In the late 1980s, the US Army had a requirement for a system to shield ground troops from the threat of ballistic missiles. The Soviet Union integrated ballistic missiles into its four structure down to the division level, with a battalion of SS-21's Scarab short-range missile launchers integrated into every motor rifle and tank division stationed in Eastern Europe.

This was the most I had seen my community really acknowledging refugees, and that is the power of art. It can be used to raise awareness, to start a conversation, and at least get people interested.

And the next thing that the cold in the winter is no joke. I knew that we're going to be cold and Vilnius and Riga were okay to be honest, but I really struggled with the extreme cold in Tallinn. It got down to minus 13 degrees and I think at the moment it's actually colder. And the next thing is that they are Christmas wonderlands. I've been to Strasbourg and Nuremberg and the Baltic episodes 100% beat them. Their markets are smaller but they're wireless commercial and the whole cities are oozing in festive atmosphere. If you want a Christmas break in Europe, go to the Baltics. And the last thing is that the history and the culture are fascinating. The country set at the crossroads between East and West, with influences from Poland, Germany, Russia, Central Asia and Scandinavia. And there are so many different facets to its history. Some of the stuff I learned was very sad and very difficult to digest, but the story of the Baltics is definitely one of resilience.

Now, under the Minsk agreements which were broken by France and Germany, a ceasefire left separatists in control of roughly a third of the Ukrainian administrative districts of Danyesk and New Hansk. But now the leaders of the whole regions have asked Putin to be declared as independent countries. And therefore states that the Kremlin can help protect. Since 2019, Russia has issued a large number of passports to people living in the Donbass region. So this is all part of the long-gain narrative of financial, military and humanitarian support from the Kremlin to this area. But protecting them from what exactly?

A year later, the devastating war wages on marked by heinous atrocities. Some of the most chilling images came from Butcher, a town that Vladimir Putin's forces occupied in March. Using exclusive phone records, documents, interviews, and thousands of hours of video, we have revealed how a Russian paratrooper unit killed dozens of people on one street in Butcher, Yablonska Street, as they tried to secure a route to the capital. We identified the main unit responsible, the 234th Guards Air Assault Regiment, a paratrooper unit based in Peskov in Western Russia. Wherever they moved, we found conclusive evidence, directly linking that unit and its commanders to the killings of civilians. Vladimir Lizovsky lived by this corner and sometimes filmed the Russians from his attic window. On the morning of March 18, 2022, he filmed Russian soldiers detaining a group of men and then executing them. The three men were Dmitro Shkirinkov, Maxime Kiriev, and with his hands tied behind his back, Alexander Tumak. Soldiers took Maxime's phone and at least 12 of them used it to call Russia just hours after he was killed. We confirmed that at least eight of the soldiers who used Maxime's phone are in the 234th, and our analysis of other calls made to Russia shows that at least 22 soldiers in the 234th used the phones of Ukrainians killed along Yablonska Street. Military commanders can be held accountable if they knew or should have known about the crimes their troops committed. And in Butcher, we know that commanding officers were walking among the dead. The person in charge of the 234th regiment is Archion Gorodilov. Two power troopers with the unit who served in Butcher told us the Gorodilov was there with them. Gorodilov was barely out of Butcher when he was promoted at this public ceremony with the head of the airborne forces, Andrei Serjukov. High-level commanders like Serjukov and Gorodilov's immediate superior, Sergei Cheubarkin, also bear responsibility for these atrocities, whether they were on the ground or not, the killings continued for weeks on their watch and have never been investigated. Butcher is a community still traumatized by Russian violence. The dozens of victims we documented on Yablonska Street are among over 400 people killed in the town in March last year. Cremlin officials have continued to deny what happened, but the evidence is clear. Russian commanders and soldiers from at least one military unit killed civilians for weeks, assuming or perhaps hoping that no one was watching.",subjective

I'm going to describe to you the effects specifically like the humanitarian the medical effects of 20 megaton bomb exploding over Boston and megaton is a million tons of TNT So the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima was about 12.5 kilo tons or 12.5 thousand tons of TNT So this weapon that we're talking about today is roughly 1,700 times more powerful so stay with me because the size of nuclear bombs today has Evolved from the 1960s so that they are smaller but more accurate. So in reality an attack on Boston today Would involve not this one 20 megaton huge bomb but probably 10 to 15 smaller weapons So even if the total megaton age was actually less the explosive force would be spread out more efficiently across the metropolitan area So in that case the actual destruction would be even greater than what I'm about to describe now Still it's a lot easier to conceptualize one big explosion rather than lots of small ones So even though the destruction that I'm about to describe is likely an under estimation of what would actually happen It still gives an adequate sort of approximation of the effects. So here we go Within one one thousandth of a second a fireball would form reaching out for two miles in every direction four miles across Temperatures would rise to 20 million degrees Fahrenheit and everything Buildings trees cars people would be vaporized To a distance of four miles in every direction the blast would produce pressures of 25 pounds per square inch and wins in excess of 650 miles per hour Forces of this magnitude can destroy essentially anything that we built as human beings Including reinforced concrete and steel structures even deep underground bomb shelters would be crushed To a distance of six miles in every direction the heat would still be intense enough to melt sheet metal Into a distance of 10 miles in every direction the blast wave would create pressures of seven to 10 pounds per square inch and wins of 200 miles per hour To a distance of at least 16 miles in every direction the heat would ignite all easily flammable materials paper cloth would leave gasoline heating oil starting hundreds of thousands of fires Fanned by blast winds still in excess of a hundred miles per hour These fires would merge into a giant firestorm more than 30 miles across And covering 800 square miles Everything within this area would be consumed by flames temperatures would rise to 1400 degrees Fahrenheit and everyone would die Beyond this great conflagration the destruction would continue at 21 miles from ground zero The blast would still produce pressures of two pounds per square inch Enough to shatter glass windows and turn each of them into hundreds of lethal missiles flying outward from the center at 100 miles an hour Even as far as 40 miles from ground zero anyone who turned to gaze at the sudden flash of light would be blinded by retinal burns One million people would die instantly another million or more would suffer injuries from which they could not recover Whatever medical care were available to them Perhaps another million would suffer wounds from which they might recover if intensive medical care were available Which we know and I can cover this in another video We know that there is no city currently on earth that has the capacity to respond To the humanitarian effects of a new grittac in the immediate post-attack period burns would constitute the most common and serious medical problems So for people who of course were far enough away to survive Hundreds of thousands of people would have sustained major second and third degree burns some from the direct effects of the flash of the heat flash on exposed skin Others injured in the thousands of fires that would rage on the periphery of the great firestorm These people would need urgent and intensive medical therapy It will not be available in the entire United States. There are only two thousand special burn special beds for burn patients Even a major medical center like Boston has fewer than a hundred burn beds And these would have been destroyed by the bond at best a tiny fraction of the hundreds of thousands of burn patients would receive medical care The rest would die And you know I can continue as much as little as we want in addition to these burn patients There would be many thousands of other injuries people blinded by the flash or deafened when the pressure waves rupture their ear drums People with lungs collapsed by the tremendous pressures people with stab wounds from flying debris People with broken bones where they have been hurled through the air by hurting wind forces or trapped under collapsing buildings So we've covered what would happen in the immediate immediate aftermath of a nuclear attack The reality is that the people who were far enough out to somehow survive the immediate attack most of us would then die in the coming months of radiation sickness exposure epidemic disease and actually starvation And this is due to not only the fact that a nuclear attack would collapse our healthcare system It would collapse all of our infrastructure our communication systems all of that But it would also cause immense climate disruption So in the event of a nuclear attack so much soot is kicked up into the atmosphere that it blocks out sunlight dropping global temperatures This needs to be another video in this series because it's something that I had no idea about before I started working in this field But this research was published just last year by climate scientists who found that in the event of a nuclear war Between the US and Russia the nuclear winter that would ensue would cause just within two years up to five billion people worldwide to die of starvation alone So that doesn't include the deaths that would be caused first of all by the actual nuclear attacks in the initial explosions But also the things that I just mentioned the people the ways that people would die in the coming months from radiation sickness from exposure from epidemic disease this is starvation alone and just in the first two years So I'm making these videos because it is so important for us to talk about what would actually happen in the event of a nuclear war The way that we talk about nuclear weapons in our society and especially this sort of rhetoric around nuclear weapons That's perpetuated by media talks about them in a very theoretical very abstract way that doesn't take into account the reality of what would happen And what will happen if we continue to have nuclear weapons because That's the reality statistically sooner or later as long as we have nuclear weapons around they will be used So we have to start talking about what would actually happen in that situation because we simply cannot afford to wait until it's too late",subjective

Castle Bravo is a bomb designed by the US with an estimated power of about 15 megatons, which is more than a thousand times the power of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Castle Bravo was tested on March 1, 1954, and the test had devastating consequences, causing significant damage to the surrounding islands and resulting in widespread radioactive fallout. Number two, Satan II. Satan II, also known as RS-28 Sarmat, is a hypersonic missile designed to penetrate NATO missile defenses. This weapon can carry up to 10 nuclear warheads, and is said to have the capability to destroy an area the size of Texas or France, according to Russian media. Quite chilling. Before revealing the number one, remember to subscribe and like the video. Number one, Tsar Bomba. Tsar Bomba is the most powerful nuclear bomb ever tested. It was developed by the Soviet Union and tested on October 30, 1961. It had an estimated yield of about 57 megatons of TNT, roughly 4,000 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb. Fortunately, the bomb was tested with a reduced yield of about 1.4% of its full power for safety reasons. Its use would be devastating for the entire world.

Putin expressed his condolences to Progoshin's family and said an investigation will be carried out. But earlier, US President Joe Biden strongly suggested Putin was involved in the death of a man who, two months ago, led a failed coup against the Kremlin. Here's our political correspondent, Cardinan. Russian investigators examining the remains of the jet, which, as far as we know, had been carrying Yevgeny Progoshin and other senior leaders of his Vagan-immersionary group. Whoever was on board, none survived. Many in the West blame President Putin for the dining of the jet. A short time ago, he offered his condolences to all who died in the crash, but he added this. I knew Progoshin for a very long time since the early 90s. He was a man of difficult fate, and he made serious mistakes in life. Whatever brought the jet down appears to have been sudden and violent. Progoshin's discrepancy and explosion, there was a sort of a bang, she says, a boom, and that's it. I saw the plane flying, and then boom, it exploded in the sky. Progoshin has not been seen since this video published in the days before the crash. And at his military groups, headquarters in St. Petersburg mourners laid flowers. In the absence of hard facts, Western governments have largely avoided comment, but the German foreign minister said what everyone else was thinking. And that here is this kind of two-file. It's no coincidence that the whole world immediately looks at the Kremlin when a disgrace ex-confident of Putin suddenly falls from the sky. Two months after he attempted in uprising. Putin supporters blame Ukraine for the apparent assassination, but today President Zelensky rejected that. And we're not. We don't have any connection to this situation, that's for sure, he said. I think everyone understands who is involved. Progoshin's mutiny in June was a particularly flagrant challenge to the Kremlin's authority, which at one point even seemed to enjoy popular support. It could explain why if this is the response, it is so dramatic. This is the first time that Putin has, if he did it, which I'm pretty sure he did, carried out such a high level murder with such blatancy. What it says about Putin's standing and power in Russia, rather contrary to what a lot of other people are saying, is I suspect it has reinforced it. We may never know what caused Progoshin's plane to fall from the sky yesterday, but it would be a surprise if his challenge to President Putin is not the reason why.",subjective

During his run as president Solidists was involved in two major historical events. One of these events being his creation of dead cell and another one being biggest push for start three, which is also known as the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. This was Solidists's mark on history. Solidists has told about Arsenal gear in the area located underneath the Big Shell. So to get it Solidists gathered his combined army and his dead cell units and renamed them into the sons of liberty and then attacked the Big Shell. He also took on the name Solid Snake to race confusion and buy him some time. Along with this his motivations keep appearing different to everyone he's aligned himself with or talked to. It goes from wanting to drop a bomb on New York to establishing his own outer heaven to getting $30 billion to blowing up the Big Shell or to obtain Arsenal gear all for himself. None of these goals are Solidists's goals. His goals were very simple actually. Solidists planned to allow right into upload the worm cluster into the AI core of GW. While it was crippled he would gather a list of names inside of GW. This list of names was all La ley de la, and then he would take the list of names and leave Arsenal gear to his soldiers in the dead cell. This was used to distract La ley de la while he goes and eliminate each of them from the shadows. Little did Solidists know that he was still part of the La ley de la themes and the worm cluster was set to destroy the data of the list of names of La ley de la. Solidists had turned from a simple grudge against the La ley de la full on hatred and their practices and actions. This is why he codally kills Olga without a second thought even though she's working for the playlets to save her own child.

After Osloat reveals himself to be part of the La ley de la. He then sends Arsenal gear colliding into New York's Manhattan Island. Both riding in solidists fall onto the roof of Federal Hall and finally solidists begin to explain it. That's right. George Washington took office as the first president of the United States of America 200 years ago today. And it happened right here. We were going to declare another independence. The dawn of a new nation here. The end of the Patriot secret rule, liberation of this country. This was where it was supposed to begin. This is where freedom could have been born.

Life is nothing but a grace period for turning the best of our genetic material into the next generation. Nobody here? All I want is to be remembered by other people, by history. The patriots are trying to protect their power, their own interests, by controlling the digital flow of information. I want my memory, my existence remained, unlike an intron of history. I will be remembered as an exon. That will be my legacy, my mark in history. But the patriots will deny us even that. My clone brothers are called monsters, replicates of evil genes. You know I'm one of a kind, but still a monster, shaped by a dark and secret history. We need to decide which monstrosity you have to give me, just survival. By the way, Jack.

These nano machines have the location of the... La La Lune La. But he would end up dying that day when Riden slices down his back and separates his spinal cord. He then drops off federal hall and reaches up to the America that he couldn't quite reach. Though, this wasn't the end for solidus, sadly. Solidus' body wasn't completely dead. He was only brain dead, actually. And his body was recovered by a paradise loss and organization run by Big Mama. His living body was used as part 4 a recovering Big Boss. And finally, he met his true end in 2014 when he was shot to death by a Zeus cannon held by Liquid Aswai. Though this was only because they thought he was the real Big Boss even though he was only being used as a decoy. Solidus and the Boss were very similar, actually, given that they were both taken advantage of by their given shadow governments. Be it the philosopher. La La Lune La. Though, the biggest difference is the Boss, when given a mission that would be the end of her life, she was completely taken advantage of, she played her part. Solidus fought back. Solidus' passion and dedication came from his desire to make something out of his life. A life of a soldier that was forced onto him that he had completely no knowledge of anything else besides. He believed deeply in the ideas of the American Dream and idolized people like the Founding Fathers, specifically George Washington. And his primary motivation for his actions were to destroy the Patriots and bring power back to the people, much like the Founding Fathers. He did sell through radical methods, but he always valued strong civil liberties and personal freedoms.

In 1984, crushed beneath a motor that came loose during securement to the test block, an accident for which the United States' occupational safety and health administration fined Hercules $640. The end of the 1980s was the beginning of the end for Hercules. The United States had been slowing production of nuclear warheads and needed fewer missiles to carry them. T-Coy was used less as a testing site and more as a storage location as military contracts dried up, leading to hundreds of layoffs in the early 1990s. Though the United States no longer needed the facility for strategic production, it was still strategically useful in a different way. Politics In 1991, the United States and the Soviet Union signed start, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, where both agreed to reduce the size of their nuclear stockpiles. Because, of course, neither country was just going to take the word of the other, numerous trust but verify policies were put into place. For example, both sides disabling their long-range bombers out in the open for the others satellites to see. And each country picked weapon production sites the other could inspect. The United States provided a list of dozens of sites for the Soviets, one of which was the T-Coy Test Range, and is why the sign in Russian is at the entrance. Temporary housing for the inspection team was built in the Soviet Union to ensure the Americans had not installed any bugs in the walls or tampered with the equipment and transported to Utah, forming a small Soviet outpost in Magna. The flags of which had to be changed after the Soviet Union dissolved and inspection duties fell to the Russian Federation. T-Coy limped on during the inspection period, but in 1995, with too many cancelled contracts, the now failing Hercules Incorporated put itself up for sale, acquired by Alliance Text Systems, an American Aerospace Defense and Sporting Goods Company. In 1999, the lease on this land expired. Alliance Text Systems did not renew, and control of the T-Coy Test Range reverted to the Skull Valley Indian Reservation, within the borders of which T-Coy sits.

196,@solomongrant5_video_7297804174702693678.txt," In 2017, a Russian oil tanker travelled across the Arctic without needing an icebreaker. That's a huge deal. The journey connects its ages Europe in just 19 days, far shorter than the 48 days it normally takes for ships to go from China to Europe's largest port in Rotterdam. That's right, our warming climate is melting the ice caps and has made this patch of ocean available for the first time in human history, making it easier for us to transport the fossil fuels that caused the ice to melt in the first place. It's an irony heavy ocean trade route we've never had before, and right now Russia is in the middle of a massive construction drive to lay claim. This $110 billion megaport on the Tamer Peninsula is quite possibly the most impressive thing that Russia's building right now. Dubbed the biggest project in the modern day global oil industry, it'll house the country's largest Arctic oil terminal, and it's so huge and so remote that state-owned oil company Rosenheft will first have to build the infrastructure needed just to get to the site. New highways, two airports, 15 villages and several electric plants will be developed around the area to get construction off the ground and house the 400,000 workers that are needed to make it all happen. So far more than 18,000 tons of heavy machinery, living quarters and communications equipment has been shipped to the site. The country's also building a 770 km pipeline to transport oil to the ports, where 10 new ice-class tankers will then take it the rest of the way to Europe and Asia. Grena Thunberg bed'll look away now, because once fully operational it's going to deliver 25 million tons of oil by 2025 and 100 billion tons by 2030. It's worth pointing out that while the cost of this undertaking seemed enormous, they pay a link of comparison to the profits that are set to be generated, and this megapaw is only one part of a larger development scheme in the region. The Russians have long seen the potential of the Arctic. In 2007 they sent a very cold diver down to the bottom of the Arctic sea to plant a flag at the north pole. Then in 2019 the country announced its Northern Sea Root development plan. The idea is to significantly increase Russian economic development along the Northern Sea Root over the next 15 years. Essentially opening the area up as an alternative to the Suez Canal for shipping cargo between Europe and Asia, especially during the summer months when the ice covering the sea could eventually disappear altogether. By 2035 Russia aims to increase cargo flow through the area by at least 72 million tons, and it's on track to hit that. In 2018 alone traffic increased by 80% from the previous year to 16 million tons, and in 2019 well up to 23 million. Russian Arctic infrastructures being brought in from the cold and getting some serious cash flash in it. Ports are being modernised, ice class containerships are being constructed, and railways are being expanded, and it goes beyond oil. Russian state-owned energy company Rossasum along with UAE-based DP welds are co-developing new ports at Mamansk and Vladivostok on either side of the route. They're being specially designed to transfer cargo off ice class ships and onto ordinary vessels. The UAE isn't the only country to see the opportunity of investing in Russia's infrastructure. South Korea and China are both eager for new ports and trade routes too. As the world is concerned about climate change and Arctic ice melt, there is one nation which of course is rejoicing in this rather worrying phenomenon. In 2018 China declared it would cooperate with Russia on a new Arctic Silk Road, signing 20 bilateral cooperative documents and agreeing to invest in the region. As part of this, Beijing will build several Chinese docks across Russia's north in ports that are currently underdeveloped and unable to handle massive volumes of shipping. As we said, a number of new railways are also being built to service these ports. The instructions underway on a 500 km line to link perm in the rural mountains with several northern port cities. Russia also recently installed a $889 million fiber nicknamed the Polar Express. The 12,600 km long cable stretches from the rural village of Terry Berker to Vladivostok, improving internet and phone connections for the 2.5 million people who live in Russia's far north. Roughly half the population of the entire Arctic. Several civilian airports are also getting a birthday, and Irma in the west and Peevik Chesky and Cape of them in the east. The dredging of the Gulf of Obb is set to be completed in 2022, allowing larger ships to pass through this strategic location. Ships that Russia is building in spades. A fleet of at least 40 new Arctic vessels will be constructed, including eight nuclear powered icebreakers and 16 rescue and support ships. Some of these will be lighter class icebreakers, which basically means they can break through extremely thick Arctic ice and create a path for commercial ships to then follow. Now, as you might expect, all this construction has made several countries nervous. We're concerned about Russia's claim over the international waters of the northern sea route, including its newly announced plans to connect it with China's maritime silk road. The US has reminded Russia that the northern sea route and northwest passage are used as straits for international navigation and are not exclusively under their control, although a lot of the route does fall into the country's exclusive economic zone. No one denies. Russia has significant Arctic interests. It's actually due to special attention of this council in part because of their sheer scale. Russia's also dependent on foreign investment to fund much of this new infrastructure, relying on other countries who would greatly benefit from alternative to the Suez Canal. Now, the country has always maintained that its new oil megaports will be environmentally friendly and that they have a very small hydrocarbon footprint. The oil installations will be ported to be powered by wind turbines. But building new oil infrastructure is not really what the world needs right now, and several environmental groups have campaigned against these projects. Parts of the oil fields are located within a protected nature reserve, and construction could damage the Arctic wildlife there. Russia's the world's fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gases and ratified the Paris agreement in 2019. Now, it's committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2060, although it's yet to agree to phase out coal and methane emissions over the next decade. One thing's clear, as we progress through the 21st century and sadly see less and less ice in the Arctic, the world is going to change in more ways than we expect.

202,@interestingengineering_video_7184882592418729222.txt," On January 17th, 2022, it made its first successful intercept against an incoming roofing missile over Abu Dhabi. This is the missile defense shield that scares China and the North Korean hate it. Although its deployment in South Korea is designed to counter North Korean missile threats, China is concerned since it could be used to spy on Chinese military installations. If pointed at China, this system's radar system might be used to track missile launches within a 6.21-hour radars. This is military mechanics and today we will look at the terminal high altitude area defense or FAD. FAD is a crucial component of the US effort to deploy a multi-layered integrated ballistic missile defense system. The high altitude in the name refers to the capability of the system to intercept incoming missiles at endow and exo-atmospheric altitudes, with a maximum engagement altitude of around 93 miles above the surface of the earth. FAD's high altitude intercept capability reduces the impact of enemy weapons before they hit the ground, and its non-explosive kinetic effect hit to kill minimizes the possibility of detonation. In plain English, missile meets missile in mid-air, both missiles go boom. FAD's massive firepower up to 72 interceptors per battery, competent organic radar and potent battle manager file control capability that is interoperable with other ballistic missile defense system parts, were all expressly built to counter mass raids. Nearly all sources agree that the FAD missile system is developed to defend against hostile incoming threats like short-range medium range and intermediate range ballistic missiles, but not ICBMs. The system's interceptor missile has a single stage thrust vectoring solid fuel rockets, practically rocket-dying butter. The missile can reach a peak speed of about eight times the speed of sound, placing it in the hypersonic category. The FAD battery typically uses two mobile tactical operations centers, six to nine launch vehicles holding eight missiles each, and a ground-based radar. The launch vehicle is a modified Oshkosh truck corporation heavy expanded mobility tactical truck with load handling system, or HEMTTLHS. The ground-based radar used for surveillance, threat classification, and threat identification is the Raytheon systems ANTPY2 radar system for the FAD. This missile interceptor can also be combined with military surveillance satellites like brilliant eyes. The sequence of a FAD interception would start with an enemy launching a missile. The missile would be detected by the FAD radar system when falling into range, and the information would be relayed to the fire control center. The fire control center would then instruct the launch of an interceptor missile. The target object data and predicted intercept point would be downloaded to the missile, and the missile would be fired from the launcher at an enemy projectile. The information on the target and interception would be continuously transmitted to the missile while in flight, and the enemy projectile destroyed when it re-entered the atmosphere. Lockheed Martin teams have successfully integrated the FAD weapon system with the PAK-3 missile segment in Hansevox or MS-C. This integration broadens the defended area and gives the forces flexibility bringing new and far-reaching capabilities. A Patriot launcher carrying PAK-3 MS-C missiles can now be integrated into a FAD battery. As a result, the MS-C's kinematic capability can be fully utilized with the FAD's radar range. The PAK-3 MS-C interceptor can launch earlier owing to integration into the FAD weapon system significantly increasing the MS-C defended area. In a February 2022 test, the team launched a PAK-3 MS-C using the FAD weapon system against assimilated targets. This test was conducted organically by the FAD weapon system. Now, the battle manager can smartly choose between the PAK-3 MS-C or FAD interceptor, while at the same time defending a larger battle space. BAE systems is developing the FAD Seeker that will utilize sensors to lock onto approaching ballistic missiles traveling up to 17,000 miles per hour. This will allow the missile guidance system to direct the FAD interceptor to the threat. FAD manufacturer Lockheed Martin is interested in developing an extended range FAD variant to counter hypersonic glide vehicles, including China's own WU-14. The FAD ER system with an improved Seeker and two stage rockets will give the interceptors three times the range. While FAD might conceivably have its ICBM intercept capabilities improved, FAD ER and other upgrades exist only as design concepts for now.",subjective

I want to give some historical context about how this has affected individuals. My great grandfather was a prominent architect in Ukraine and was tortured to death by the Russian police in 1925. Family fled Russian, controlled Kiev to Poland, controlled Viv. In the years of 1932 to 1933, the Ukrainian holocaustic was a forced famine caused by Stalin from Russia onto Ukraine's punishment for not succumbing to the Soviet Union. Any type of food, livestock, crop, even pets were taken out, 10 million Ukrainians start to death in one year. Parents killed themselves for something for their children to eat. My grandmother, her two sisters and mother were imprisoned in a slave labor camp. My grandmother's first husband was killed by Russian police. Her baby started death in that camp. She met my grandfather, was a doctor there, and they fled to the United States in the 1950s. My mother grew up in the United States and much of her cultural life at home. Was focused on restoring sovereignty to Ukraine. Most Ukrainian Americans, Ukrainian Canadians, Ukrainians, and other parts of the world are not there by choice. The only reason my family is in the United States in the first place is because of Russia. This has been repeated throughout history. We have been ignored. We have been silence. For the longest time, our language and culture were banned from being practiced. I wasn't even born in Ukraine, and yet Ukrainian was my first language because we were so determined to keep our culture alive. We cannot let this happen again. Please put pressure on NATO and other allies to fight with Ukraine right now. We are all alone. Please check the sources in my bio and ways that you can help. Please protest. Please keep sharing factual information. Slava ukrayina, Yoroyim Slava. Thank you for all of your love and support.",subjective

These submarines perform the same role. They are part of the country's nuclear triad, comprising land-based nuclear missiles, strategy nuclear bombers and nuclear arms submarines. Summarines are the most survivable component of the nuclear triad, due to their ability to remain hidden underwater and avoid enemy detection. The Ohio class is capable of carrying up to 24 SLBMs, but due to the strategic arms reduction treaty, they are only allowed to carry 20. China's Jin class submarines can only carry up to 12 SLBMs. The Ohio class carries the Trident 2 SLBM, which has a range of more than 6400 nautical miles. The Jin class carries the Ji Lang, Giant Wave SLBM. The JL2 and JL3 have the range of 3800 nautical miles and 5400 nautical miles respectively. Each Trident 2 has up to 12 multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle, capable of hitting different targets. The JL2 carries anywhere from 1 to 8 warheads. The number of warheads carried by the JL3 is not disclosed. In terms of Blast you, American warheads also have a higher yield. Additionally, the Ohio class also carries mark for the 8 torpedoes for self-defense as opposed to the Jin class. The Ohio class can travel at a speed of 12 knots on the surface, and more than 20 knots when submerged. The speed of China's Jin class is unknown. Although the Jin class were built in 2007, they are noisier than the Soviet Iran nuclear submarines developed in the 1970s, and are acoustic signature of 120 decibels. As noise level directly affects the stealthiness of the submarine, the Ohio class would be much stale dear. For countermeasures, the Ohio class is equipped with mark 2 torpedo decoys and electronic warhead equipment. It is unknown whether the Jin class have similar capabilities. As both submarines are nuclear powered, they do not need to refuel and are only limited by food supplies. In conclusion, the Ohio class is superior in terms of armorments, missile range, and stealth. Due to the lack of available information, it is impossible to determine which submarine is superior in terms of speed and countermeasures. In terms of anti-summerine warhead capability, the United States is a head of China with more anti-summerine assets, sound surveillance system, as well as intelligent sharing among allied nations. Both the US and China are currently developing their next generation SSBN. The US has started building the Columbia class submarine back in 2020. The Columbia class is expected to enter service in 2021 and replace the Ohio class by 2040. China is developing the Type 96 submarine. However, details regarding its development is not disclosed.

This is seen most clearly in the latter part of the name, which comes directly from the loose people who were initially from Northern Europe and settled all across Eastern Europe. These guys of course lend their name to Russia too. The former part of this country's name constant word white in various Slavic languages. So what made the Rus of Belarus so white? Well, there's a couple of ideas. The most popular theory on the matter is that the white in their name is referenced either skin, hair or clothing color of choice, or the fact that they were heavily Christian and white is an important color in that religion. As the Rus settled so much land in Eastern Europe, there used to be many more places named after them, such as Red Rus, Galatian Rus, Black Rus, Great Rus, and even Little Rus.

248,@horizongeopolitics_video_7295022379439328544.txt," The Suez Canal, a man-made channel in Egypt, linking the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea has been a cornerstone of global commerce and geopolitics since its inauguration in the late 19th century. The canal offers the most direct maritime link between the Mediterranean Sea and the waters of the Indian Ocean and Red Sea, which is paramount for oil transit. Roughly 12% of the world's trade navigates through the Suez Canal, encompassing about 10% of global oil distribution, underscoring its significance for European and Asian markets dependent on the smooth transit of commodities. The modern Suez Canal was conceived by French engineer Ferdinand de la Seps and opened in 1869. Initially operated by an international consortium, Egypt sold its shares to Britain in 1875. Prior to its completion in 1869, vessels were compelled to sail around the Cape of Good Hope, adding an additional 7,000 miles and many weeks to their voyage between Europe and Asia. The governance over the Suez Canal has traditionally given nations a geostrategic edge. For example, throughout the Cold War, the canal emerged as a hotbed of contention between the Western and Eastern alliances. Furthermore, the decision by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser to nationalise the Suez Canal in 1956 ignited the Suez Crisis, highlighting the canal's utility as a geopolitical instrument. The canal's significance led to closures during further conflicts, notably the Six Day War in 1967. It reopened in 1975 after the Camp David Accords, an expansion in 2015 facilitated larger vessels and improved two-way traffic. Since the 1956 crisis, Egypt has retained authority over the canal, gaining considerable income and diplomatic leverage. Although officially the passage adheres to the Convention of Constantinople, ensuring it remains consistently accessible and navigable in wartime as in peacetime for all commercial or military vessels irrespective of their flag. Beyond its commercial significance, the Suez Canal also holds importance for military operations, acting as a rapid naval pathway for vessels, where it to be blocked the military endeavours of nations dependant on the canal for quick personnel and material movement would face significant setbacks, a scenario underscored by the economic upheaval following its blockage by a capsized cargo ship in March 2021. All these factors positioned the Suez Canal as an essential maritime nexus, with both global and local powers vying for leverage over its military and commercial activities. The Suez Canal's future hinges on global trade growth, technological advancements and environmental shifts. Increased maritime traffic may demand further expansions, while automation could enhance navigation safety. Climate change might necessitate adaptive infrastructure measures. The emerging northern sea route due to melting ice could introduce an alternative route, potentially impacting the canal's traffic volume. Geopolitically, the canal remains a strategic focal point, offering Egypt economic opportunities, but also presenting security challenges.",subjective

From a peak of 60,000 warheads just before the end of the Cold War, there are approximately 13,000 nuclear warheads today. 90% of these are owned by Russia and the US. However, Chinese stockpiles look likely to expand after President Xi highlighted the need for a strengthened deterrent strategy in 2022. They are numbers. Nuclear proliferation is a major concern. States other than the original recognized nuclear states of the non-proliferation treaty, the US, Russia, China, the UK and France have managed to develop nuclear weapons. India, Pakistan and North Korea have demonstrated nuclear weapons capabilities, while Israel heavily implies it. Iran and Syria are among the states understood to be developing nuclear weapons. South Africa and the post-Soviet states of Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania, having one's possess them, eventually gave up nuclear stockpiles.

On July 23, 1983 a group of Tamil separatists attacked and killed 15 Sri Lankan army members. This didn't come from nowhere. This was a reaction to decades-long anti-tamil violence perpetrated by the ruling party of Sri Lanka during that time. Over the next seven days, mobs of the singleies majority took to the streets with voter registration lists provided by the government and killed up to 3,000 Tamil injured more than 25,000 of them and then displaced about 150,000 Tamil. The economic costs of those riots are estimated to be around $300 million today. My family members shared stories about how the mobs would stop buses and they would try to identify Tamil in those buses by asking them to pronounce hard singleies words. And if they were Tamil, they would drag doubt, flugged and often left to die. Make no mistake, this was state-sponsored violence. This is the picture of then-president J.R. Jawa, who was reported saying, if I starve the Tamil's out, the singleies will be happy. I'm a Tamil man living in the diaspora. Protesting and crying out for justice publicly might be new to a lot of people in Sri Lanka right now. It is not new to the Tamil people.

This advanced system is designed to safeguard the nation's airspace against a variety of airborne threats. Let's delve deeper into its capabilities. The Spider System boasts a dual-launcher configuration, which enhances its versatility. It features both short range and medium range missile launchers, ensuring that it can engage targets at different altitudes and ranges. In the short range category, the Spider employs the Python 5 missile, which has a range of approximately 20 kilometers, 12.4 miles. This missile is ideal for countering close-in aerial threats with precision. For engaging targets at greater distances, the Spider System is equipped with the medium-range Darby missile. The Darby missile boasts an impressive range of around 50 kilometers, making it a formidable asset in protecting Philippine airspace. One of the remarkable features of the Spider System is its ability to engage multiple targets simultaneously. This multi-target capability ensures that it can effectively defend against complex aerial threats, which is vital for modern air defense systems. The Spider System relies on an active radar guidance system, which plays a pivotal role in tracking and engaging targets with pinpoint accuracy. This advanced guidance technology enhances its effectiveness in neutralizing airborne threats, as for the quantity of Spider missile systems in the Philippine arsenal, it's essential to consult official government sources or the latest updates, as this may vary over time. As of my last update in September 2021, the Philippines had expressed its intent to procure several Spider systems to bolster its air defense capabilities. In conclusion, the Philippine Spider missile system is a formidable addition to the country's defense capabilities. With its dual launchers, multi-target engagement capabilities, and active radar guidance, it stands as a significant asset in safeguarding the Philippine airspace against a wide range of aerial threats.

This is what would happen in a potential scenario in which nuclear weapons are spread across the entire United States in a massive World War III type of scenario. We're gonna go over this and see exactly what's going on with all of this and make it maybe a little bit less scary, a little bit more scary for you. So let's find out. First thing is this key right here, where if you're in the white regions, you probably would not need to shelter unless you actually saw a nuclear blast. That would be completely different. Or if the radio told you to. The darker it is, the longer you're gonna need to stay in some sort of decontaminated area. Hopefully you'd have a basement, a bunker, something like that. Lider it is, the less time you have to spend. Nuclear fallout actually has a really short half-life and within two weeks, it would be almost completely gone. However, regions you would want to avoid is down in low valleys and little gull. Where the material that is nuclear fallout would actually settle because it is just radioactive articles that are falling from the atmosphere. Looking at the West Coast, we can see some of these major cities that would be hit pretty hard. A lot of these areas, especially up here, have quite a lot of nuclear silos and military bases, which is why they'd be hit like right here in Idaho and up here in Montana. They'd get hit pretty hard because they do have air force bases and nuclear capable bombers. Also see over here on the East Coast, pretty severe. And look like even Ohio made it out clean.

But with a grinding, war in Ukraine, a spate of coups across Africa, growing discontent across the global south and a host of new international organizations now on the world stage, why exactly should we care about what happens at the UN? The answer unfortunately is that the UN is just not that relevant, particularly when it comes to issues of peace and security. Although it still plays a key role on humanitarian issues, the institution remains powerless when it comes to geopolitical conflicts. That's in part because the permanent five members of the UN Security Council wheeled vetoes to block any resolution they don't like. But the UN's downward slide in relevance has also been compounded by the rise of newer, nimble, or international organizations. There's NATO, which is spearheaded Ukraine's defense. There's the BRICS grouping that recently voted to expand its membership.

In the wake of such relentless assaults, enhancing air defense capabilities is crucial for Ukraine to restore a semblance of normalcy in its major cities. Since the onset of the war, Kiev has fortified its defenses with an array of air defense systems, including German-Iris T batteries, Hawk anti-missile systems, Avengers and Patriot units. The latest addition to Ukraine's surface-to-air missile or SAM in ventry is the Franco-Italian SAM-T air defense system. This system is capable of countering a wide spectrum of airborne threats, including cruise missiles, both manned and unmanned aircraft and tactical ballistic missiles, with a range class of up to 372 miles. This is military mechanics, and in this episode, we will take a look at the SAM-PT surface-to-air defense system. The Seoul Air Moyen Porte Tareste or surface-to-air medium-range land-based or SAM-T also nicknamed MAMBLER by the French Air Force is the cornerstone of Italy and France's contributions to the North Atlantic Alliance's tactical ballistic missile defense capability. SAM-T is produced by Euro SAM, a 50-50 joint venture between MBDA and Thales. The system entered service in Italy and France in 2011. SAM-T is composed of a fire control system that uses the Airebell multi-function electronic scanning radar and a vertical ground launcher. This launcher is mounted on Italian, Astra Iveco and French Reynolds caretacks 8x8 trucks. The SAM-T MAMBLER launcher vehicle is equipped with 8 missile containers ready for launch situated at the truck's rear. Each missile can be fired in a salvo from a single launcher in under 10 seconds. The Airebell is an X-brand 3D multi-function radar designed for surveillance, target tracking and missile guidance. It features a rectangular phased array antenna with 4,000 elements. This system is capable of tracking up to 100 targets at once and transmitting guidance commands to 16 missiles simultaneously. Designed for versatility, the radar system can be used in a mobile land configuration, such as the ground primary sensor for a medium range surface to air missile or an enable setup. The SAM-T employs an ASTAR 30 block 1 missile which features a re-engineered SEAKER, fuse, signal processing and a directional explosive warhead that focuses the larger shrapnel towards the target. Inertial guidance is used during its mid-course phase with corrections to its path relayed from a ground-based command sensor via the uplink data channel of the Airebell multi-function radar. The ASTAR 30 can reach a top speed of approximately 0.78 miles per second. It's designed to intercept targets ranging in altitude from about 164 feet to 12.4 miles. For targets above an altitude of about 1.86 miles, the ASTAR 30 can engage at distances up to 62.1 miles. However, for aircraft flying below this altitude, its effective range is reduced to 31 miles. The SAM-T has been designed to operate an extreme clutter and electronic countermeasures in bounds. Another crucial aspect of the SAM-T initiative is its compatibility with other NATO air defense systems. The entire setup can be air transported using the most recent NATO tactical cargo planes, like the Airbus A400M and the Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Securities, allowing for global deployment. In a gathering of EU defense ministers, US military officials, NATO representatives and industry executives in Paris, France, President Macron emphasized this truly is a case of Europe defending Europe. The SAM-T air defense system stands as a potent symbol of its resolute commitment to collective security.",subjective

These are the primary trade routes between Europe and China, Ocean Route, Northern Corridor, and the ever-expanding Middle Corridor. Because of the Russia-Ukraine War and Western sanctions on Russia, we actually saw 34% decline in shipping along the Northern Corridor, with the Houthis attacks in the Red Sea, and the first two months of 2024, we actually saw 50% drop in shipping along the Sue's Canal in comparison to last year. Because of those two factors, we're seeing a huge resurgence along the Middle Corridor, which was initially unappealing because of bottlenecks and transition between land and sea. This railway going across Baku, Azerbaijan, is the only east-west land transit route by which goods from China and Central Asia can transit to Europe without going through pariah states like Iran or Russia. It's called the Middle Corridor, and it is revolutionizing global trade. A conflict in Ukraine has disrupted supply chains, generated food shortages, and sent commodity prices soaring. But despite the turmoil, geoeconomic forces continue to pull Europe and Asia together. China's plan to develop a trade corridor through Russia is up in smoke, while Iran's rogue policy-making terrifies foreign investors. Now, the alternative Middle Corridor is gaining steam. Running from China through Kazakhstan to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, across the Caspian Sea through Azerbaijan and Georgia, before connecting to Europe via Turkish railways and ports, the Middle Corridor provides the shortest overland route from Asia to Europe. I'm sure you can infer that the United States is not happy with China's growing influence in the global economy, which is exactly why President Biden is now spearheading the newly proposed Middle East Corridor. I'll talk about the Middle East Corridor more in my next video, but it's an economic corridor to strengthen global trade between India, the Middle East, and Europe. When it comes to your team of order, you can expect the Middle Corridor to shorten shipping times to 10 to 15 days.",subjective

This has already happened in Germany, where the German government is taking over the gas utilities. One of the big utilities there, a uniper has been losing 100 million dollars a day. So these utilities are insolent. The governments don't have a choice. They're having to impose these price caps.

Likely to be the world's first energy-based missile defense system in full-fledged use, the Iron Beam will help create an all-encompassing defense network capable of stopping anything from UAVs to missiles and more. The main drawback of this system is that it has a lower effectiveness in low visibility situations and like the Iron Dome, it uses visuals to target an attack and cannot rely solely on radar to hit a target.

She's lost in a loan. She's lost her parents and her family and she's wondering around the world from cities to cities looking for her mom. Artistic director Amir Nizar Zerbi first created Little Amal to stir conversation about refugees, but the project turned into something much larger. We didn't expect that Amal will become this international symbol of human rights. Her message to the world is you can't afford to forget about us and to forget about children like me. We are everywhere. We're all around you. You need to see us. You need to take care of us. We are a common responsibility of mankind. Since July 2021, Amal has visited 15 countries. She's now walking across the United States, stopping in 42 cities. Before ending at the US Mexico border in the San Diego Tijuana region, in November, Amal will attend 120 different artistic events created in partnership with humanitarian groups and arts institutions along the way. In September, she stopped in Washington, DC and walked from Freedom Plaza to the Capitol. There, she was surrounded by emergency blankets and a river of children's shoes representing the refugee children around the world, many of whom are still missing. They're present and absent at the same time and it's their lives we're talking about. They're all around us. They're not invisible, although we sometimes prefer to look the other way. Upon her arrival at the Capitol, little mall was welcomed by US lawmakers. They spoke very beautifully. They spoke very profoundly about who she is and why she's there and why it matters now. And for us, obviously, it's important because it puts Amal in the center of the political debate in the centers of power. And if she's in the center of power, that means the children she stands for are also with her in the centers of power. They become visible. Amal's walk this year will also double as a fundraising event for refugee and displaced children around the world. We are responsible for one another and accountable. And I think that is something that we constantly need to remind ourselves. We as societies, we as individuals are much stronger when we care for others.

339,@shieldwalldefence_video_7094638800462351662.txt," We are going to look at, what is the Todd Missile Defense System? Terminal High-Altyd Area Defense Todd, formerly theater high-altitude area defense, is an American anti-ballistic missile defense system designed to shoot down short, medium, and intermediate range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase, de-central re-entry, by intercepting with a hit to kill approach. Todd was developed after the experience of a rock-skud missile attacks during the Gulf War in 1991. The Toddian Deceptor carries no warhead but relies on its kinetic energy of impact to destroy the incoming missile. A kinetic energy hit minimizes the risk of exploding conventional warhead ballistic missiles, and the warhead of nuclear-tip ballistic missiles will not detonate upon a kinetic energy hit. Originally a United States Army program, Todd has come under the umbrella of the missile defense agency. The Navy has a similar program, the seed-based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, which also has a land component, Aegis Assure. Todd was originally scheduled for deployment in 2012, but initial deployment took place in May 2008. Todd has been deployed in the United Arab Emirates, Israel, Romania, and South Korea. On January 17, 2022, Todd made its first operational interception of an incoming medium-range ballistic missile in the UAE. Block E is pushing for funding for the development of an extended-range VR, version of the Todd account or maturing threats posed by hypersonic glide vehicles that adversaries may deploy, namely the Chinese WU-14, to penetrate the gap between low and high altitude missile defenses. The company performs static fire trials of a modified Todd booster in 2006, and continue to fund the project until 2008. The current 14.5 in, 37 cm diameter single-stage booster design would be expanded to a 21 in, 53 cm, first stage for greater range with a second kick stage to close the distance to the target and provide improved velocity at burnout and more lateral movement during an engagement. Although the kill vehicle would not need redesign, the ground-based launcher would have only five missiles instead of eight. As of 2020, Todd ER is only an industry concept, but Lockheed believes that the missile defense agency will show interest because of the weapons under development by potential adversaries. If funding for the Todd ER begins in 2020, a system could be produced by 2024 to provide an interim capability against a rudimentary hypersonic threat. The Pentagon is researching whether other technologies like directed energy weapons and railguns are better solutions for missile defense, these are expected to become available in the mid-delay 2020s.

Little boy, a uranium-235 gun-type bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 and had a yield of about 15 kilotons, marking it as the smallest of these historical nuclear detonations. The first nuclear bomb explosion, marking the successful conclusion of the Manhattan project, occurred on July 16, 1945 in New Mexico, United States. Oppenheimer named his plutonium-based implosion test Trinity after John Donne's poetry, the bomb, known as the gadget generated a blast yield of approximately 20 kilotons of TNT, forming a mushroom cloud that rose 7.5 miles into the sky. The fat man bomb, similar in design to the gadget, was detonated over Nagasaki on August 9, 1945 and had a higher yield of about 21 kilotons, making it larger than both Little Boy and the gadget. The first French hydrogen bomb, codenamed Le Corne, was tested on July 3, 1970 in French Polynesia, with an estimated yield of 914 kilotons of TNT. Le Corne marked France's entry into the thermonuclear age, further progressing in scale on November 1, 1952. The United States tested the first hydrogen bomb, codenamed Ivy Mike. The bomb was detonated on the NWA attack at all in the Marshall Islands. Ivy Mike was a two-stage thermal nuclear device, and the yield of the explosion was around 10.4 megatons of TNT, making it around 500 times greater than that of the Nagasaki bomb. The blast resulted in a fireball five miles wide and created a crater over a mile wide and 164 feet deep. On March 1, 1954, the United States conducted the Castle Bravo test, detonating a new design of a thermonuclear device at Bikini at all in the Marshall Islands. The bomb had a yield of approximately 15 megatons of TNT, greatly surpassing its predicted yield and making it more than 700 times as powerful as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The pinnacle of the nuclear arms race was reached with the largest nuclear detonation in history, conducted by the Soviet Union on October 30, 1961. Known as the Tsar Bomba, it boasted an unprecedented yield of approximately 50 megatons of TNT. Even though its design allowed for up to 100 megatons, this was 2,500 times the combined yield of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs, and approximately 10% of all the combined yield of every nuclear test up to that point. The fireball stretched approximately five miles in diameter, and the mushroom cloud reached a height of about 40 miles, nearly seven times the height of Mount Everest.",objective

385,@militarynews.us_video_7245198448436284715.txt," This is America's Patriot and Missile Defences. Ballistic missiles are making a comeback in the 21st century because they give countries like China, Iran, North Korea and Russia the ability to strike targets hundreds or thousands of miles away without having to expose vulnerable warplanes to interception. The precision allowed by modern guidance systems allows even non nuclear missiles to deliver highly deadly attacks against air bases, fuel and ammunition depots and even moving aircraft carriers. Therefore, the ability to intercept ballistic missiles is also growing in importance. But surface to air missiles, SAM, designed to shoot down aircraft, struggle to hit missiles flying many times faster and higher. And the further a ballistic missile can go, the faster and higher it must fly and the harder it becomes to intercept. The United States has developed spectrum anti-ballistic missiles, ADMs from the Patriot Pack 3 Missile Segment Enhancement which can intercept tactical ballistic missiles, the high flying THAAD and naval SM-3 block 2 missiles which can counter short to intermediate range systems and ground-based mid-course defense interceptors in Alaska that can tackle intercontinental range missiles. The Patriot is the US Army's primary air and missile defense system. It was originally designed as an anti-aircraft system, but the newer variants of Patriot are capable of engaging ballistic and cruise missiles, loitering munitions and aircraft. It was first developed in the early 60s to replace both the Nike Hercules and Hawk air defense missile systems. The Army named the program Surface to Air Missile, Development, SAMD and the first tests occurred in 1969 and 1970. In the 1970s, the Department of Defense overhauled the SAMD to include a track via missile guidance system. The updated SAMD was renamed Patriot and entered full production in 1980. The Army activated its first Patriot missile battalion in May 1982. MIM-104 Patriot phased array tracking radar to intercept on-target. Patriot missiles are launched from Patriot missile batteries based on the ground. A typical battery has five components. One, the missiles themselves. Two, the missile launcher which holds transports, aims and launches the missiles. Three, a radar antenna to detect incoming missiles. Four, an equipment truck is known as the engagement control station, housing computers and consoles to control the battery. Five, a power plant truck equipped with 250 kilowatt generators. The Patriot is a guided missile that uses ground-based radar to surveil, track and engage targets. An incoming missile could be as far away as 50 miles, 80.5 kilometers, and the Patriot systems radar can lock onto it. That distance, the missile would not be visible from the ground, much less identifiable.",subjective

Es ist unmöglich mit einem Partner zu verhandeln, der an Doppeltes spiert hat. Es musste so kommen. Nach der Sabotage der Nord-Train pipeline und nachdem festgestellt wurde, dass die USA direkt an den Versuchen der Ukraine beteiligt waren, russische strategische Flugzeuge anzugreifen und neue nuklearere Sprenkkopfetze entwickeln. Hat Russland beschlossen, die Teilnahme am Vertrag zur Reduzierung strategischer Waffen auszusetzen. Das sagte Vladimir Putin in seiner Rede vor der föderalen Versammlung. Und eine solche Wendung der Ereignisse ist wohl kaum nach dem Geschmack Washington's. Umso mehr, als das der Anteil der russischen Nuklearstreitkräfte, an den modernen Waffen bereits mehr als 91% beträgt. Aber ich wiederhole, die Notwendigkeit, sich um die Sicherheit Russland zu sorgen, wurde allein durch die unverholen feinzähligen Handlungen der Vereinigten Staaten diktiert. Und als Washington schließlich erkannte, dass es den Bogen überspannt hatte, wurden mehrere Versuche unternommen mit Moskau zu verhandeln. Natürlich zur amerikanischen Bedingungen. Es ist ja so, dass die Vereinigten Staaten Zeit brauchen, um ihr nukleares Potenziaat zu erneuern. Und Washington hat auf Stadt viel gesetzt. Kein besonders raffinierter Trick. Anfang Februar forderte die amerikanische Seite bei der Rüstungskontrollvereinigung, bei der auch die russischen Experten per Videolink anwesend waren, diese fortige Aufnahme der Verhandlungen über den neuen Staatviervertrag, der der bisherige 2026 ausläuft. Das hat natürlich nichts mit amerikanischen Pazifismus zu tun. Washington fürchtet nur eines, das russische Atomwaffenarsenal, mit dem man rechnen muss. Und das ist nicht nach dem Geschmack einer Sondernation, die es gewohnt ist, die Welt zu beherrschen. Erinnert euch daran, dass die Massenproduktion von Atomspringköpfen in den USA 1989 gestoppt wurde, als das FBI eine Ratschia in der Anklage Rocky Fleitz in Colorado durchfühte. Bereits seit den 1960er Jahren wurden Lex und die Versorgung der Umgebung durch radioaktives Material aus dieser Anlage festgestellt. Im Jahr 1989 führte eine Fefunkktion der Anlage dazu, das Gromseure in die Abwasserkannele der Stadt gelangte. Das FBI leitete seine eigenen Ermittlungen ein, und 1992 wurde der Betreiber Rockwell wegen 10 Umweltverbrechen verschuldig befunden. Die Anklage wurde noch im selben Jahr geschlossen. Das Ausmaß der Kontamination war so immens, dass mehr als 800 Gebäude abgerissen, mehr als 21 Tonnen radioaktives Material bewegt, mehr als 1,3 Millionen Kubikmeter abverentfärmt und mehr als 72 Millionen Liter Wasser aufbereitet werden mussten. Die Aufräume arbeiteten wurden erst 2005 abgeschlossen und kosteten 7 Milliarden Dollar. Derzeit verfügen die Vereinigten Staaten nun noch über ein einziges Laborenlos Alamos, in die Manipulationen an Atomspringköpfen vorgenommen werden können. Von 2007 bis 2011 wurden dort insgesamt 29 Nuklear-Springköpfe für U-Boot-gestützteraketen nachgerüstet. Seit 2013 ist die Produktion wegen Nicht-Einhaltung der Vorschriften für den Umgang mit radioaktive Material ausgesetzt. Die Arbeiten wurden jedoch 2021 wieder aufgenommen und im Juni des selben Jahres verkündete die nationale Atomaufsichtsbehörde die Fertigstellung des ersten Sprangkopf-Upgrades für U-Boot-gestützteraketen, allerdings mit einem Jahrverspätung und mehreren 100 Millionen Dollar mehr kosten. Die Anzahl der Sprangköpfe, die von der Modernisierung betroffen sind, wurden in öffentlichen Käln nicht genannt. Es wurde jedoch festgelegt, dass die Modernisierung die gesamte Nuklear-Triade betreffen würde. So sollten die Fliegerbomben im Jahr 2020 die Nuklear-Springköpfe für Marschflugkörper im Jahr 2025 und die Intercontinental-Raketen auf Silobasis im Jahr 2030 modernisiert werden. Nach Angaben des Bulletin, der Atomwissenschaftler, gibt es in den USA heute etwa 3800 Sprangköpfe, die 30-40 Jahre alt sind. OS-Wissenschaftler haben weder holt die Langlebigkeit der bestehenden Atomspringköpfe untersucht. Im Jahr 2003 definierte die nationale Atomaufsichtsbehörde nach der Durchführung von Studien die Mindestlebensdauer von Atomspringköpfen, von 45 Jahren, ab dem Herstellungsdatum. Im Jahr 2019 wurde die Atomaufsichtsbehörde auf Initiative der Regierung von US-Präsident Donne Trump beauftragt, die Produktion von 80 Atomspringköpfen bis 2030 wieder aufzunehmen. Damals hieß es in einer Pressemitteilung der Organisation, dass diese Produktion aufgrund der Alterung der Plotoniumladungen und der Notwendigkeit das Atomwaffenasenheit zu modernisieren, wieder aufnehmen würden. Da die USA seit fast drei Jahrzehnten nicht in der Lage sind, Sprenkköpfe, in denen die für die Lagerung von Atomwaffen erforderlichen Mengen zu produzieren. Als erster Neustandort für die Produktion von Atomspringköpfen wurde die nicht zu Ende gebaut, Mox-Brennstoffanlage in Savannah River, Südkoreleiner ausgewählt. Diese Anlage war seit 2007 im Rahmen eines amerikanischen, russischen Abkommens über die Entsorgung von Plotonium im Bau, aber das Projekt wurde 2018 gestoppt, weil es zusätzliche 13 Milliarden Dollar benötigte und 32 Jahre hinter dem Zeitplan zurücklag. Obwohl die Anlage laut Plan zu 70% fertiggestellt war, während 30 bis 50 Milliarden Dollar erforderlich gewesen, um den Bau abzuschließen, die festgestellten Konstruktionsfilter zu beheben und die Funktionsfähigkeit zu erhalten.

Despite the suspension, Russian officials have clarified that they will still comply with the current treaty limits on long-range nuclear arsenals. The new start treaty is aimed at limiting the number of long-range nuclear weapons that both countries can deploy, calm and allows for mutual expression of each other's strategic nuclear sites up to 18 times per year with short notice. Some analysts notice that the suspension of the Russians' participation in the treaty is not considered a formal withdrawal, but it could create more difficulty in determining compliance. Moreover, Putin warned that Russia is willing to restart nuclear weapon tests. If the US does so, a practice that has been mostly banned since 1960. The suspension of Russia's participation in the treaty and the possibility of nuclear weapons testing have deep concerns and a potential new arms race between the US and Russia.

In 1984, crushed beneath a motor that came loose during Securement to the Test Block, an accident for which the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration find Hercules $640. The end of the 1980s was the beginning of the end for Hercules. The United States had been slowing production of nuclear warheads and needed fewer missiles to carry them. T-Coy was used less as a testing site and more as a storage location as military contracts dried up, leading to hundreds of layoffs in the early 1990s. Though the United States no longer needed the facility for strategic production, it was still strategically useful in a different way. Politics In 1991, the United States and the Soviet Union signed start, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, where both agreed to reduce the size of their nuclear stockpiles. Because, of course, neither country was just going to take the word of the other, numerous trust but verify policies were put into place. For example, both sides disabling their long-range bombers out in the open for the others' satellites to see. And each country picked weapon production sites the other could inspect. The United States provided a list of dozens of sites for the Soviets, one of which was the T-Coy Test Range, and is why the sign in Russian is at the entrance. Temporary housing for the inspection team was built in the Soviet Union to ensure the Americans had not installed any bugs in the walls or tampered with the equipment and transported to Utah, forming a small Soviet outpost in Magna, the flags of which had to be changed after the Soviet Union dissolved and inspection duties fell to the Russian Federation. T-Coy limped on during the inspection period, but in 1995 with too many cancelled contracts, and now failing Hercules' incorporated put itself up for sale, acquired by Alliance Tech Systems, an American aerospace defense and sporting goods company. In 1999, the lease on this land expired. Alliance Tech Systems did not renew, and control of the T-Coy Test Range reverted to the Skull Valley Indian Reservation, within the borders of which T-Coy sits. Though T-Coy operates no more, its work lives on. 120 trident nuclear missiles are still actively deployed, waiting with their solid fuel motors calibrated here at T-Coy to assure mutual destruction.",subjective

We're starting off this story with that because right now there's a lot of rumors and speculation stating that he has died from his injuries on Sunday. For those who don't know on Monday, a large Russian telegram group announced that on Sunday night Putin had a heart attack in his presidential suite. That account really has given mixed information throughout the past year and a half. Sometimes their stuff was true, sometimes it was false. But the big thing is that when they were true, they were ahead of the game. That sometimes made them very credible, which is why when they put out some information, people do tend to believe them. So when they announced that Putin had a heart attack at 9 p.m. on Sunday, a lot of sources started to believe it. Though the Kremlin said that's a hoax and it's not true. This channel, General SVU, is now coming out and earlier today announced that Putin had died from his injuries on Sunday. The Kremlin responded to this by denying it outright saying that is not true, but interestingly enough, there is one interesting thing going on behind the scenes. It's no secret that Putin does have body doubles. We've talked about it on this channel. They walk differently, they swing their arms differently, and sometimes in the face they look very off. It has been reported and confirmed by many different Russian telegram groups that his body doubles. Their security has been beefed up. There are some people who have said that well, Putin can't be dead because on Wednesday, he was at a meeting where they were talking about the nuclear strikes or the revenge strikes. While Summers saying it's possible that they could have cut in other footage of him to make it seem like he was all well and alive, but I just want to leave you with this. As of right now, there is no verified, no confirmation. There really is no evidence that he has died nor has he had a heart attack. I'll be sure to keep you guys in the loop because this story is breaking right now. So it's possible that a lot of other news sources are going to pick up on it.

If President Trump comes to office and continues to take a hard line against NATO, it doesn't guarantee one particular future. It could involve a future that's very dangerous at the collapse of NATO.

For example, cluster bombs, which is basically illegal in every single country except for the two big ones. America and Russia, so that's kind of nice. But there are things that should become war crimes, but apparently are not war crimes. For example, the most dangerous weapon of all time, nuclear weapons. They can blow up one city in one go. They should be banned, but apparently they're not banned, mainly because most of the most powerful countries who have nukes kind of use them as a political bargaining tool. It's not that safe. So that should become a war crime. But is it? Yeah, chlorine gas can take out a whole battalion. But, you know, nukes aren't really used for offensive. They aren't used for defending yourself. They're used for destroying civilian populations. Now, that is what I call a war crime. Same thing for cluster bombs. Basically, the only use for cluster bomb is either to scare a bunch of soldiers away or to injure civilians, which is what it's most commonly used for.

He led the state-owned oil company, Rosniyft, to produce 40% of Russia's total oil while controlling more than half of the company's shares. Similarly, the Russian state also controls more than half of the shares in Gazprom, the largest company in Russia that produces more than 12% of the entire world's natural gas supply. The CEOs of both companies are longtime friends of Putin dating back to the 1990s before he assumed the presidency. And unlike his immediate predecessors of the 1990s, Putin was incredibly fortunate because the international prices of oil and gas began to skyrocket shortly after he assumed office, and Russian financial power was once again on the upswing alongside it. In 2000, when Putin first took office in 2012, the value of Russia's annual oil and gas exports increased by around 7 fold. From only $53 billion in 2000 to $351 billion in 2012. Consequently, Putin used these funds to dramatically increase the annual budget of the Russian military by nearly 9 fold, from just $9.2 billion to $81.4 billion over that same time period. In addition to paying off the Soviet Union's entire outstanding debt and freeing up his ambitions across the rest of the post-Soviet world, outside of Central Asia, one of the biggest problems for Putin's goals were the old Soviet-era pipeline networks that took Russia's hydrocarbon resources to market in Europe.

And before I get the comment saying that I don't know what I'm talking about, or this isn't about me, I've got Varuparusky, Ajeel Varasi, Vomotavi, Ivo kraine, Itoje, Yarobotalva, Niskolkik, Oranzaci, Varasi, Ivo kraine, Itoje. Generally what she said was correct, but there are two things that like, rub me the wrong way. One was just like kind of misleading the other one is like dangerous for Black people that want to travel to Russia. The misleading one is simple. Yes, technically Zareniklis I said that there will be no trading of African bodies in Russia, because it's a moral. But Russia had the system of Serfdom, which was like their equivalent of slavery. So saying that the West European structure of slavery is immoral while upholding Serfdom is in and of itself problematic. So that was misleading. Second and more importantly, she said that if you are Black, nothing bad will happen to you in Russia. People will just want to talk to you and want to take pictures with you. And that is sometimes true, but more often than not very untrue. Sometimes people will want to know where you're from, especially if you speak Russian, because just as she said, a lot of people from Russia have never met a Black person in real life. And so they will want to know where you're from, where you're in Russia, if you speak Russian, so on and so forth. But more often than not, and this is reflective of my experience and the Black people that I have met in Russia, it is very dangerous for us to be in these spaces. I personally have been followed, I've been attacked, I've been choked, I've been spit on, I've been hit. Many things have happened to me as I'm living my life just walking down the street or sitting in a restaurant. And same thing usually worse to other Black people that I've met, especially if they are darker skin than I am. But this idea among White Russians that Black people won't have a problem in Russia is very pervasive. A lot of White Russians think that and oftentimes it comes from the fact that in Russian history, because they had surfed them not slavery and they didn't colonize Africa, race was not formalized in the same way that it was in much of Western Europe and North America. Therefore, the conception of race and racism, as we know it in the West, don't exist in Russia. But just because the conception does not exist does not mean that racism does not exist. I've had the privilege to live and visit many different countries and I will say that the worst racism I've ever experienced in my entire life, aside from Italy, is Russia. And just a quick rule of thumb if you're ever wondering what it's like to be a minority in a different country, listen to the minorities not the White people.",subjective

Here are five things you need to know about refugees and global displacement from UNHCR's latest global transfer for. One, today there are over 110 million displaced people around the world. Last year the number of people forced to flee conflict, violence and human rights violations grew by 21 percent. This marks the largest increase in a single year in UNHCR's history. Two, in 2022 52 percent of displaced people in need of international protection came from just three countries, Syria, Ukraine and Afghanistan. In fact Syrian refugees make up the largest group of refugees around the world with over 6.5 million of them living across 131 countries. Three, the majority of forcibly displaced people are hosted in neighboring or low- and middle-income countries. 70 percent of refugees are living in neighboring countries and the staggering 76 percent of refugees are living in low and middle-income countries. Four, children are disproportionately impacted by forced displacement. In 2022 children made up 41 percent of the world's forcibly displaced population even though children only make up 30 percent of the world's population. Over the last four years more than 1.9 million children have been born as refugees. Five, last year we saw the highest number of new asylum applications ever on record. In 2022 2.6 million new asylum applications were filed from over 140 nationalities across 155 countries. Latin American and Caribbean nationals made up over 40 percent of the applications with the US receiving the highest number of applications at 730,400.

459,@alexhollings52_video_7267300997293149482.txt," Let's talk about the time Wagner Group mercenaries attacked US Special Operations Forces, outnumbered and outgunned them, and then were hung out to drive by the Russian government after they lost the battle. On February 7th of 2018, a small detachment of around 40 US Special Operations troops, mostly hailing from Special Forces and Delta Force, were holed up in the Kanoco gas plant in Syria. Now that gas plant was on the Syrian Democratic Forces controlled side of the Euphrates River, and during the day Russian forces began massing about two miles away under the guise of a training exercise. But at just about 10.30 pm, they launched their assault behind a hail of artillery mortar and 125 millimeter tank fire. Now the Russian force was comprised of more than 500 Wagner Group mercenaries and Syrian soldiers, supported by two dozen or more armored vehicles, and at least 10, T-55 and T-72 tanks. On the other side, the American Special Operators were dug in, but they had no heavy weapons. They were armed only with small arms, including rifles and machine guns. About 20 miles away, they had a quick reaction force positioned with five more armored vehicles armed with 50 caliber machine guns, and a small group of Syrian Democratic Forces for support. Now at 10.30 pm, when the Russian forces launched their attack, they didn't start by advancing. They were happy just to bombard the area with artillery, tank and mortar fire. But that gave the quick reaction force an opportunity to get there. However, all of the Syrian Democratic Forces fled when they saw the level of fighting ahead of them. So by the time the QRF team arrived, it was made up of only five armored vehicles and 10 US Special Forces green berets. They quickly joined in on the fight, holding back the Russian offensive. After three hours of heavy fighting, the Wagner group forces had closed within just 300 meters of the American position, and the American Special Operators had literally nothing they could do to stop the advancing tanks. Even the most highly trained Special Operator in the world can't stop a tank column with a rifle. But just when all seemed lost, US air power arrived in the form of just about every tactical aircraft in the region, including B-52s, AC-130 gunships, AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, MQ-9 Reaper drones, F-15E, strike eagles, and even the F-22 Raptor. When the dust had settled after a 45-minute air-powered bombardment, not a single US troop had been injured. One Syrian Democratic Forces soldier fighting with them did get minor injuries, but the death toll on the other side was palpable. The lowest estimates out of Syria are better than 50. The highest estimates are more than 300. And according to one Wagner group mercenary who participated in the battle and was recorded discussing it later, it was at least 220 or so, including every armored vehicle except for one being destroyed. For their part, the Russian government still denies any hand in this operation, even though it was later revealed that Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime had actually offered Russian officials and the Wagner group in particular a 25% commission on the proceeds of that natural gas plant once it was up and running again. In other words, the Wagner group and Russian officials in Syria legitimately risked open war between nuclear powers at best and World War III at worst over a 25% commission on a natural gas refinery. Now this is a massive story, and over the past few weeks I have been pouring over primary sources. First hand accounts from the special operators who participated in the battle, as well as audio recordings from Wagner group mercenaries who also participated in the battle. And I've compiled what may be the most thorough recounting of events that has been published online yet. It'll be up pretty soon on sandbox news and it'll be followed by a full video that I'll post on YouTube.",subjective

470,@returnmediadaily_video_7220599074792410414.txt," On this day in history, April 10, 1972, the United States and the Soviet Union signed the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, Salt One, a landmark agreement aimed at reducing the number of nuclear weapons in their respective arsenals. The signing of Salt One was the result of years of diplomatic negotiations and represented a critical step towards easing tensions between the two superpowers during the Cold War. The events leading up to the signing of Salt One can be traced back to the late 1960s, when the United States and the Soviet Union began engaging in talks on arms control. In 1969, President Richard Nixon and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev initiated negotiations on limiting the arms race, recognizing the need to avoid a costly and dangerous nuclear arms race. These negotiations culminated in May 1971 with the signing of the Strategic Arms Limitation talks, Salt, Agreement, which laid the groundwork for Salt One. The formal negotiations for Salt One began in November 1971 with both sides engaging in intense discussions on various aspects of arms control, including limiting the number of strategic ballistic missiles, anti-ballistic missile systems, and underground nuclear testing. The talks were complex and contentious, with both sides seeking to protect their respective national interests while also striving for mutually beneficial outcome. After months of negotiations, on May 26, 1972, President Nixon and General Secretary Brezhnev signed the One-Shilling Agreement in Moscow. The treaty consisted of two main parts. The Anti-ballistic Missile, ABM, Treaty and the Interim Agreement on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. The ABM Treaty limited the deployment of anti-ballistic missile systems, while the Interim Agreement placed limits on the number of strategic ballistic missiles that each side could possess. The signing of Salt One was met with global claim as it was seen as a significant step towards reducing the arms race and promoting global stability. Many countries, including U.S. allies in Europe, welcomed the treaty as a positive development in the effort to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. However, the treaty was not without its critics. Some conservatives in the United States argued that it did not go far enough in addressing the Soviet threat, and that it would leave the U.S. at a strategic disadvantage. Nevertheless, the treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate in August 1972, demonstrating a broad consensus for arms control among U.S. policy makers. In the years following the signing of Salt One, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union took steps to implement the treaty. They engaged in regular consultations and inspections to ensure compliance, and the treaty was seen as a positive step in improving U.S. Soviet relations. However, the positive momentum of Salt One was ultimately challenged by geopolitical developments. In 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, leading to increased tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The subsequent deterioration of relations between the two countries led to a freezing further arms control negotiations and an eventual breakdown of Salt One. Despite its eventual demise, Salt One remains a significant milestone in arms control history. It demonstrated that diplomacy and negotiations could be effective in addressing the dangers of nuclear weapons and reducing the risk of an all-out nuclear war. It also set the stage for future arms control talks between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, leading to the signing of the follow-up treaty, Salt Two, in 1979. So it was never ratified. The strategic arms limitation treaty had several significant long-term implications. First, it established a precedent for arms control diplomacy between the two superpowers, showing that negotiation and dialogue were possible despite ideological differences. Second, it contributed to the stable asation of the strategic balance between the United States and the Soviet Union by capping the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles each country could deploy. Third, Salt One included confidence-building measures such as Darduk's changes and verification procedures that promoted transparency and trust between the two countries. Fourth, Salt One had a broader impact on global geopolitics, setting the stage for future arms control negotiations and influencing subsequent agreements like Salt Two and the Intermediate Change Nuclear Forces Treaty. Finally, while facing criticisms and limitations, Salt One is considered a significant milestone in arms control efforts during the Cold War era, with its legacy continuing to shape international relations and arms control efforts today.",

First of all, to be a tour guide at the UN, you have to speak at least two languages. And as a guest, you can request tours in over 14 different languages. Secondly, assuming a meeting is an improgress, you get to see areas of the United Nations usually blocked off to the public. For example, the Security Council Chamber and the General Assembly Room. There's also a lot of art inside the United Nations headquarters, much of which has been gifts from member states such as the Japanese Peace Bell. You'll get to learn about how and why the United Nations was formed and how it's evolved over time. New themed tours have also just been introduced and I desperately want to check them out. For example, a focus on women's history tour which just launched in March commemorating women's history month. They even have a tour for kids aged 5 to 10. Adult tickets started at $26 per person and can be purchased at UN.org. For more NYC, follow me.",
