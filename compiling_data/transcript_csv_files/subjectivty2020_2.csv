@magikalsistar62_video_7083763374659538218.txt," So can you please share what you're insecure about? I'm trying to prove a point. Housing. It's most definitely housing insecurity. I became a leader of the homelessness union for a organization in my state, because I've always faced housing insecurity. And so I started to use my voice and speak up on that and fight for the rights of people in my state. Now, this is going back from childhood. I was on my own at 16, and I started to struggle with issues like this back then. Once I became a mother, I was a little more stable for a while. But then it happened to me years ago, about four years ago. I was homeless with my kids for two years. We lived in hotels, and we lived in shelters. After that experience, and once I started to get on my feet, I decided that I was going to fight for the rights of anybody that's facing issues like I do. And that's when I found out that there's a lot of people dealing with housing and securities. And what do I mean by housing and security? If you don't know, housing and securities are for everything from not being able to pay a rent, worrying about paying rent, not being able to find a new place to rent, not being able to get a loan for a home or put money down on a home. Homelessness. These things are affecting more people than we know. But if you look into it, you'll find out that in my state, New York, there are over 100,000 people homeless. And despite my best effort, which I was doing everything right, I didn't fuck up, I didn't do anything wrong, it wasn't a bad tenant, I wasn't behind on my rent. And I'm getting evicted because my landlord sold my building to a company that wants to tear my house down so they can make a parking lot for another apartment building, an affordable housing apartment building. And although I know that that is very much needed, the way they're going about it is affecting people. And so laws need to be changed in our state. And all over the United States, especially rent prices, it needs to be a cap on rent prices. Because right now, I'm being evicted and I have to move, but I can't find a place because I can't afford the prices. I can barely make it by paying $1200 a month. Now I'm facing $15 to $7,300 a month for a rental property. Start to look into buying a house. I have to come up with a down payment for that house. The mortgage on the houses that I'm looking at are significantly lower than any rental property that I'm looking at. And a lot of people are renting out properties like this for twice to triple the price, which is fucked up and leaving people on the street.",subjective

I spent my entire life in academia so I can definitely understand money can be tight. I left medicine like six months ago to start my online business and a big part of having an online business is you need a blog. Basically you need a blog to rank on Google and the more blog posts you have, the better chances you have at ranking. Here's the thing, I always thought that blog posting is like creative writing, you're writing a story, it's like some sex in the city on her computer thing, not the case whatsoever. Same exact method that you do to figure out a research question, finding a very, very niche topic and then answering one very, very specific question. Same exact thing with writing blogs. If you're wondering what's the data, the data is literally right here. So this is Google keyword planner, you can actually get this for free, you just set up a Google ads account and this comes with it and you don't need to pay. Just search up any random word, I just searched up unique silverware. And if you look through, it'll literally show you similar words, their average monthly search volume and look at this, their competition level. If you're consistent with that for several months, you're going to start generating a lot of money because Google is going to start viewing you as an authoritative figure on that very niche topic. I'm talking about thousands of dollars every month. I'm super passionate about this so I can share a lot more on the topic if you're actually interested, let me know.",subjective
@cofi_la_more_video_7324368923913162030.txt," ¿Qué hago si se me perdió el social de mi bebé? Bueno, lo que tú vas a hacer es exactamente lo mismo que te haría si se te perdió tu social. Vas a ir al Social Security Administration Office y lo vas a poner en Google, ahí lo vas a buscar en tu mapa donde sea cerca de mí. Social Security Administration Office, cerca de mí o near mí o como tengas el ser indetus celular. Ahí te vas a salir, ya yo les enseñé cómo buscar eso en el video anterior, pero si no lo habéis, pues les digo aquí. Voy a salir la oficina que te queda más cerca. Entonces tú vas a ir, hay dos maneras de hacerlo. Para cualquier trámite que tú necesitas de hacer tienes que entrar y tienes que sacar un número. Hay una pantalla ahí, entre a la oficina le dices al de seguridad porque tú no puedes entrar ahí sin decir la de seguridad. Eso ustedes van a entrar, le dices, voy a entrar por este trámite. Entonces tú entras, ellos te van a dirigir hacia qué pantalla ir. En esa pantalla o en esa cabina o como tú le llames, ahí tú vas a tener que sacar un número, sacar un número y sacas para qué. Nuevos Social Security, se me perdió el Social Security. Entonces tú vas a preciar la opción que dice, se me perdió el Social. Tú puedes tramitar eso ahí mismo en la pantalla sin tener que pasar a ventanilla con una persona. Tú pones ahí, se me perdió el Social y pones, ahí te van a hacer preguntas en la misma ventanilla. Tú terminas y ya eso te va a llegar a tu casa y te puedes ir a tu casa ahora. Si tú quieres para mayor seguridad, tú puedes sacar un número, esperar a llegar a ventanilla y ahí mismo ellos te van a ayudar a hacerlo para que te llegue a ti. Eso es algo muy fácil de tu hacer, no creas que va a ser difícil. Hay muchas, muchas que me escriben al DM que me dicen, yo soy muy, hay una muchacha que me dijo, yo soy muy dunda para esas cosas. Hay chicas que dicen, eso es muy difícil, no es difícil, es súper fácil. Y es en cuestión de un día y de minutos, solo le recomiendo de que al Social Security lleguen temprano porque las oficinas son muy pequeñas, al menos en mi estado, no sé en el suyo, pero son muy pequeñas y hay mucha gente, así que llega lo más temprano que pueda llegar. Mi social me llegó con mi nombre mal escrito. Entonces yo personalmente tuve que ir a hacer eso. En el caso mío, yo fui, busse en la pantalla, que mis nombres, porque ahí es opción también en la pantalla, que mi nombre estaba mal escrito. Entonces yo fui, busse en la pantalla que mi nombre estaba mal escrito y coloque mi nombre bien escrito y me llegó a la casa, no cuesta nada, si estás preguntando, ¿cuánto cuesta sacar nuevamente al social? Porque se te perdió que no cuesta nada, a reglarlo tampoco, no cuesta nada. Ahora lo que no puedes hacer, porque suya es un trámite legal, es cambiar el apellido. En el caso mío, a mí me habían escrito mal el apellido, creo que el nombre, no me acuerdo, porque hace mucho años. Pero me habían escrito mal uno de esos dos, el mío, el mío, no le me decimo el mío. Entonces yo fui para que me los cambiaran, ahí en la misma pantalla hice para que ellos me los cambiaran. Si ese es tu caso, tú lo único que tienes que hacer es lo mismo, vas para que te lo cambien. Hay unas personas que me preguntan, ¿cómo hacer para cambiar el apellido? Eso es un trámite legal, no es lo mismo que tú cambies, de lópes a martines, a que tú cambies la s de lópes a zeta, porque tal vez tú has pedido con zeta y no con ese. Veis, es una diferencia. Entonces, ahí es que se equivocaron y lo puedes ir y lo puedes hacer. Para los que quieres saber si se me perdió el social, me van a dar un nuevo número, no. El número que te va a nadar es el mismo, lo que te van a mandar es la cartita, la carta del social, es la que te la van a mandar a tu casa. Bueno, amigas, yo sabía que me van a hacer esta pregunta y dije, ¿a qué les digo de una vez?

COLA stands for Cost of Living Adjustment and By-Law Every Year Based on Inflation, Social Security recipients get an adjustment to their benefit. Now before I get into what that actually looks like in dollars per month, I want you to know that I'm going to be emailing out this notice of COLA increase in my news girl news round up email tonight.

So if you sign yourself up for the round up, you can always forward it onto them. Now starting with the first payment in 2024, the average monthly Social Security or SSI check will be about 1900 bucks. That's up about $60 more per month than recipients were seeing in 2023.

@universify1_video_7192037915139132678.txt," The economic crisis of 2008 was one of the most severe financial crises in history. It began in the fall of 2008 and had an impact on the entire global economy. The crisis began in the U.S. with the housing bubble, which had been building up for years. Banks and financial institutions had granted too many risky mortgage loans and then sold them as safe investments to other banks and investors. These housing prices began to fall and more and more people were unable to make their loan payments, these investments collapsed. One of the first major banks to get into trouble was the investment bank layman brothers. In September 2008, it had a file for bankruptcy, which set off a chain reaction and caused panic on financial markets. Investors and banks began to withdraw their money from other banks and financial institutions, putting them in trouble. Banks and central banks in the U.S. and Europe had to intervene to calm the situation and keep the financial systems running. They made billions of dollars available to save banks and other financial institutions and lowered interest rates to boost economic growth. The economic crisis had devastating effects on people around the world. Millions of people lost their jobs, their homes, and their savings. It took years for the economy to recover and for unemployment to decrease. The economic crisis of 2008 showed us how quickly things can change and how important it is to be aware of risks and to be prepared. It also led to a series of regulatory reforms to prevent future crises and make the financial system more stable.",subjective

The glass will then travel up the conveyor belt where it reaches the hammer mill, and it will get crushed into a mixture of sand and gravel. The machine is able to separate trash like labels, cords, caps, things like that from the actual sand that we want. Something like this will come right out of the machine as a mixture of sand and gravel, and it'll be sifted to be separated into the fine sand that we make up to the gravel size.

The samples researchers were working with needed to be kept at minus 112 degrees Fahrenheit, and the freezer they used had a built-in alarm system that would sound if the temperature inside the freezer changed. But the freezer malfunctioned, and the alarm was sounding constantly, even though the temperature was consistent. Researchers called a maintenance crew, but due to the 2020 restrictions, it was going to take a week before the repairs could take place. Researchers put a sign on the freezer that said, this freezer is beeping as it is under repair. Please do not move around, plug it. No cleaning required in this area. But when the janitor arrived that night and heard the alarm sounding, he figured the freezer must be off. So he went to the electrical panel and flipped the switch for the freezer circuit breaker, which he believed would turn the freezer back on again. But what he actually did was cut the power to the freezer, but he also stopped the alarm from sounding, so he believed he'd been successful.

If the company sees the need that their officers need ballistic vests because there is the chance that their officers might be harmed, those officers should probably be armed. Or the company sees it as like an intimidation factor and wants those officers to be more intimidating with their vests, which I mean, been being on arm, that just causes even more risk to those officers.

So I was on a call at my client yesterday, wonderful girl on her way to an HBCU. And the first thing she asked me were their scholarships for dorms and housing. Because despite choosing her collegemate first, giving her depositmate first, giving her housing deposit shortly after that, not only does she not have housing, they put her on a wait list. They had no record of her accepting their offer and no record of her email in the system. And every time she or her mom tried to call, there was no answer. And when someone did pick up, they had no answers. Lord Jesus, there's a fire. Because what is happening on these campuses in these universities? And this is not a problem just for HBCUs, elite universities, have this overcrowding problem, Yale University had this problem, Purdue had this problem. But with HBCUs enrollment blowing up, there's not enough space to put all these kids. But why do you all keep accepting all these kids and taking their money if you can't house them? And it's a pause to read. But this has been a long standing problem. I had this problem 32 years ago, averaging a state. Some colleges have even gotten creative, putting students up in hotels, and creating dorms out of storage units, and containers like this. So we know the problem. What's the solution? How are we gonna fix it? And what can you do to help yourself in times of crisis? You definitely wanna be persistent. Call the college, call housing, email them, stay on a next. The next thing you wanna do is join a community, a group chat, Facebook, of other incoming freshmen, sophomores, at your level, at your college to see what other problems they are and how they're attacking and solving the problem. Off campus housing is something that the college is responsible for. So your loans and your scholarships can go to pay for an apartment. It's not too far from your campus. Look into that. But finally, get some scholarships. Scholarships that you win can go toward dorm, these, food. We also need to talk about food insecurity. Scholarships can help pay for your apartment, pay for housing, pay for utilities, pay for groceries. Get these scholarships today. I can show you how.

So far, New Yorkers seem to have mixed feelings on the new safety measures popping up at a Manhattan subway station. These bright yellow railings were installed at the platform at the one train stop at a hundred ninety first street over the weekend. Personal opinion. I like them. Take it provides safety. I think it's a good thing. Some at this Washington Heights stop telling us the railings do make them feel safer. And the MTA says that's the goal. They're designed to stop people from falling on the tracks and the railings are aligned. So the subway doors don't open in front of them. These new barriers are part of a pilot program. Last year, safety barriers were installed at three other city subway stations. Still some say it's not enough. It feels a little bit too little in a way. It's like they see different cities across, you know, not necessarily the country with the world that has have much more robust security. It's kind of like we should have that too. So could be not enough, I'd say. Back out here in Washington Heights, we're told that there are several other subway stops that'll be part of this pilot program, including two other stops in Brooklyn. After those get rolled out, the MTA will then look to evaluate the effectiveness of the subway railings as well as people's response to the railings and decide where to roll them out next.",subjective
@aiethicswithpaige_video_7060948344650255663.txt," I think it's time we talk about the digital divide. So the idea to create this video came from me watching a video this morning by Senade Bovel who was a thought leader in the world of artificial intelligence. I'll tag her below so that you can follow her. But she created a video where she was talking about a specific type of artificial intelligence where you could type in what you need and it will write your code for you. Now this technology is really interesting but it's not like comprehensive as a solution and she gives this example that you can type in some things that maybe able to build you a web page but you couldn't type in build me a Netflix type platform and have it do that for you. Humans are still involved in that process but what she said at the end of the video is what really got me. She said artificial intelligence is going to impact every job but we have time to prepare for that now. So why did I bring up the digital divide? It's because I believe that artificial intelligence is uniquely positioned to disproportionately negatively impact the digital divide in the United States and in the world. So for those who are unfamiliar with the digital divide it's that division between individuals who have access to information communication technologies and those who don't. Information communication technologies include the devices with which we connect to the internet and the internet itself but not just access to the internet reliable and consistent access. I research artificial intelligence in the United States so I'm going to talk to you today about this report that was created by the US government about the digital divide. Even though the report was updated in March of 2021 this data is actually from 2019 and you can take a look here and see that in 2019 10% of United States adults did not access the internet. That's 26 million people. If you look at the third line down you can see that the digital divide actually disproportionately falls on racial and socioeconomic fault lines. Third line down tells us that of the individuals the adult individuals who did not access the internet in 2019 almost 30% or black or Hispanic as compared to 8% Caucasian. And if you take a look in the fifth row down you can see income information. 18% of the individuals who didn't access the internet made less than $30,000 a year. And finally if you take a look down here you can see that 29% of individuals who didn't access the internet had less than a high school education. So why am I picking on AI? Artificial intelligence is created to mimic human behavior and it is easily automatable in most scenarios so it can be automated to do a job more quickly or more efficiently than a human can do it. What it does then is it destabilizes some of these jobs that are necessary for these individuals in a maybe a lower income situation to be able to survive. A lot of people say that AI creates more jobs but those jobs are often technical and require access to the internet. So if you fall below the digital divide you miss out. So how can we start preparing for this now? Simply put we need to be really careful about building and deploying technology that empowers some while simultaneously disempowering others.",subjective

@psych2go3rs_video_7204354549618855195.txt," Psych2Go presents 10. Rare psychological and neurological conditions that you should learn about. Let's begin. Number 1. Aradamania Aradamania is a condition where a person believes that someone, whether it's a liberty or someone they know, is madly in love with them. They hold onto their belief even when there's no evidence of such being true and may even end up with false evidence to justify their behavior. They may sometimes demonstrate violent and obsessive behavior towards that person. Other times, it can be just an infatuation they don't act upon. Little is known about this condition, but it's believed to affect women more than men. 2. Musical Ear Syndrome Musical Ear Syndrome is an auditory hallucination commonly found in people who have tenitis, though it can also arise from brain trauma, medication, and even stress. This syndrome can cause great levels of discomfort as they may be hearing the same song or sound over and over again. It's believed to be caused by the brain taking obscure, ambient noises and filling in the blanks, which can sound like music. Number 3. Visual Snow Syndrome Those with visual snow syndrome can see what can best be described as static or visual noise overlaid on everything in their field of vision. The severity varies from person to person, where some may struggle with night vision or migraines. However, the majority may not even notice it. This syndrome is not considered a disorder and is often said to have little impact on a person's daily life. Number 4. Alien Hand Syndrome Alien hand syndrome is where your hand acts as if it has a mind of its own. Your hand becomes uncontrollable unlike the rest of your body. It may also act out in opposition. Imagine picking up an object off the floor, only to have your hand suddenly and purposefully drop it down. This is a neurological condition with no cure, but there are treatment options to manage it. Number 5. Foliedue Do you know that it's possible for two or more people in a close relationship to share the same delusions? Foliedue or shared psychotic disorder is a psychotic delusion that develops in one person, the active participant, and gets passed onto a person close to them. It most commonly occurs in families. However, there are half-ping reports where it affected a doctor and a patient, as well as a person and an animal. Number 6. Hemispatial Neglect Strokes are scary experiences in general that come with a variety of complications, one of which may be hemispatial neglect. This is a rare disorder where a person ignores half of a certain space. When asked to draw a picture of a clock, they may only draw half of one. In other instances, they may eat food off of one half of the plate. This condition is more neurological than psychological, meaning these actions are not intentional, rather a result of damage to the neurological system. Number 7. A Fantasia What do you see when you try to visualize a slice of pie? Perhaps it's creamy and rich, or maybe it's a goopy and vibrant red. While it may be easy for you to imagine it, people with a Fantasia are unable to make a mental image of anything. It's an unusual condition that most are unaware of. Number 8. Sinisthesia In your imagined seeing different colored lights flash when you listen to music, Sinisthesia is a condition that involves a stimulus activating multiple sensory pathways, like hearing and seeing sounds. It can come in many forms and takes on variations within each form. While seeing colors with sound is one form, a person may also have words, numbers, or days of the week associated with colors. For example, Wednesday is blue. It's not considered a disorder, but rather a unique experience. Number 9. Faketicist Disorder Have you ever pretended to be sick to get out of going to school? People with faketicist disorder take this to an extreme level, where they intentionally try to get ill or harm themselves just to appear sicker. It can be hard to determine if someone has this disorder, as they can become highly advanced at faking their symptoms. This is especially risky, as they may take life endangering measures to convince others of their illness. Number 10. Dancing Mania Dancing Mania has appeared throughout history with an unknown cause. The dancing plague of 1518 was characterized by the citizens of Strasbourg, breaking out into spontaneous and uncontrollable dancing. People who dance until they collapse of exhaustion only to begin again after resting. It killed approximately 15 people per day and went on seemingly without end. While the exact cause of it is unknown, most historians agree that it was likely a mass psychogenic disorder, then see affected cities where under extreme stress from famines and disease.",subjective

The article goes on to describe the kinds of people and families that we're seeing in shelters, and you're not seeing people that are historically poor. You're seeing people who have $100,000 a year in their job, who now have medical debt. You're seeing people with advanced degrees. It's happening to everybody. It could happen to you. I think people moralize these issues because it allows them to put distance between themselves and being house-less when all of us are at risk. And instead, we should be asking what are landlords doing to make the rent so high that people who grew up in these cities can't afford them anymore?",subjective
@yadavinder.singh_video_7337168811235364114.txt," Have you ever wondered how the global economic landscape is shaping up in 2024? Dive into a world where digital currencies, artificial intelligence and climate change are not just buzzwords, but significant variables impacting the world economy. In the year 2024, the global economy is in a state of flux, with these factors playing a pivotal role in shaping economic trends. The first major trend causing ripples in the economic waters is the rise of digital currencies. The world has taken a quantum leap from traditional cash-based transactions to digital ones. Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies are no longer speculative assets, but have become mainstream. Central banks worldwide are grappling with the idea of launching their own digital currencies. This shift towards digital currencies is revolutionizing the financial sector, providing transparency, reducing transaction costs, and facilitating cross-border transactions. Artificial intelligence is another game-changer, driving productivity and efficiency across sectors. From healthcare to manufacturing, AI is revolutionizing business processes, leading to cost reduction and improved quality. However, it's not all rosy. AI is also disrupting job markets, with automation replacing traditional roles, leading to growing concerns about job security and income disparity. Lastly, climate change is not just an environmental issue anymore, it's a significant economic concern. With increasing natural disasters and extreme weather events, economies worldwide are bearing the brunt of climate change. The cost of adaptation and mitigation is soaring, leading to a shift towards sustainable and green economies. Green bonds, carbon credits, and sustainable investing are gaining momentum, reflecting the changing priorities of investors and governments alike. So, what does the world economy look like in 2024? It's a fascinating mix of digital finance, AI-driven industries, and climate conscious policies. It's an economy where digital currencies are becoming mainstream, AI is redefining business processes, and climate change is reshaping investment priorities. But remember, with these changes come challenges, the need for robust digital security, the ethical use of AI, and the need to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability, it's a world full of opportunities but also one that requires careful navigation. The global economy in 2024 is not just about numbers and growth rates, it's about how we adapt to these changes and make the most of the opportunities they present. It's about shaping an economy that is not only prosperous but also sustainable and inclusive. It's about ensuring that the economic benefits of digital currencies, AI, and climate action are shared equitably. In conclusion, the world economy in 2024 is a reflection of our evolving world, a world that is more digital, more automated, and more conscious of its environmental footprint. It's an exciting time, full of possibilities and challenges. So buckle up and get ready for an economic ride like no other.",subjective
@teosysk_video_7219370004020464938.txt," The majority of modern banking crises can be traced back to the fall of the Glass-Steagall Act, enacted in the wake of the Great Depression, separated commercial banking from investment banking in the United States. The act aimed to reduce the risks associated with financial speculation and promote stability in the financial system. Proponents of the repeal of Glass-Steagall argued that the separation of commercial and investment banking was outdated and hindered the competitiveness of American banks. The Glass-Steagall Act was repealed by the Gram Leach Bliley Act, which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on November 12, 1999. The repeal was seen as a major step towards modernizing the financial system and allowing banks to compete more effectively. However, critics argued that the repeal led to increased consolidation in the financial industry, as large banks grew even larger and engaged in risky activities that ultimately contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. The 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act was introduced in both the House and Senate in 2013 and 2015, but did not pass. Some states have taken action to separate commercial and investment banking activities within their borders. For example, in 2019, California passed a law that would prohibit banks from engaging in certain types of speculative trading and require them to separate their commercial banking and investment banking activities.",subjective

@finaidguy_video_7301367507225464106.txt," So as messages are confirmed that just because you don't actively live in the street, that doesn't necessarily mean that you're not homeless according to the definitions provided by the Department of Education when it comes to completing financial aid application. According to the definition by HUD, which is the Department of Housing and Urban Development, in order for individuals to be considered homeless or at risk of homelessness status, you simply need to lack fixed, regular and adequate housing. So if you're a student that's currently living in a shelter, in a motel, in a car, or in a park or temporarily living with other people because you have nowhere else to go, you technically count as a homeless student. One thing to keep in mind is that in some cases, you might be required a submit documentation to confirm that status. As such, if you have some form of letter from a HUD advisor that specifically confirms that you've taken advantage of shelter services within your local community, or if you can get a member within your high school to provide an attestation that you have, in fact, been self-supporting on living by yourself outside of your home, that can serve as well for those purposes. Remember that students who are homeless or at risk of homelessness do qualify for independent student status consideration. And we want to make sure that you receive as much of those benefits as you qualify for given your specific status. So when the next class application rolls around, make sure that you do report that information correctly on that application. And if you need any help or assistance regarding any of that information, feel free to drop them in the chat or send me a message. I'm happy to help you through this process. I hope this helped.

@jay.b.roaming_video_7153053077313047851.txt," So when you land in the airport and Ladyville, the main airport, and the national airport, you're looking at paying at least $30 to head into the city. So that's pretty standard for most airports. There are drivers outside with taxis, and that's the main method of getting around because there is no Uber or Lyft out here. So from the airport, there are a few ways you can get to the islands, which are more touristy, more popular areas. You can get to the islands via a plane, a smaller plane, and those tickets are going to run you at least $100, maybe no more than 200. Or you can take the boats, which is what I did. The boat rides are going to cost you about $40, and those boat rides can take you anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour and a half to make it to your destination. Once you get to your destination, especially on these islands, there aren't many cars. You realize that a lot of people are driving golf cars. You can either rent a golf cart or you can hell a golf cart driver to give your ride. And those rides can cost you anywhere between $5 to $10. So if you're getting around a lot, you may just want to rent one, depending on how long you want to be here. And if you rent multiple people, you can split the cost of the golf carts. So the price of the golf carts depends on who you're renting from. For example, I'm renting one right now. I've been in San Pedro for about a week. And so of course, it does add up if you're getting around like I am. So it's costing me about $75 a day for the golf cart. And yeah, that's not so fun. But if you want to walk all over the place, you can. But you got to understand, as a tourist, some of these rides are probably going to start attaching you to get around. So it's better to just invest in your own golf cart for rent. Another big question that I got was about safety. For those who know me, like I said, I travel solo often. I live in Atlanta essentially by myself for about 12 years. So safety has always been paramount to me. When I travel alone, I share my location with the least two friends. I think right now at least four people have my location at all times at nowhere I am. I also advise that people plan and I tolerate that they can send to their friends to know where they are at all times, send them the location to the Airbnb's or hotels. And also watch your back and don't be so trusting up everyone. There are nice people all over the place. But make sure that you have something that you can use as a weapon or make sure that you have some hand-to-hand combat. That's fresh and that's, you know, you can put the use if you need to.

But did you know that there are laws in place to protect you, the consumer? My name is Ryan Peterson, and I represent consumers against these billion dollar credit bureaus. I'm going to empower you with knowledge about consumer protection laws so that you can hold these companies accountable. Let's start with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA. This statute ensures that your credit reports are accurate and that you have the right to dispute any errors. For example, if you notice a credit card account on your report that you didn't open, you have the right to dispute it and make the credit bureaus investigate that dispute. Here's another powerful statute. It's the Fair Credit Billing Act, or the FCBA. This protects you from fraud. For instance, if you see a charge that you didn't authorize, you have the right to dispute it with the credit card company, and you aren't liable for it. And one of my favorites is the Truth and Lending Act, or TILA. This law requires the disclosure of the terms and conditions of any loan or credit agreement, including the interest rate or fees. For example, if you're taking out a mortgage, the lender has to provide you with a breakdown of all the costs associated with your loan. By knowing your rights under these laws, you can hold corporations accountable and protect yourself against fraud and inaccuracies.",subjective

@nixonbcmortgage_video_7358540855696805125.txt," With high interest rates, isn't inflation supposed to be going down? We weren't from 2.8 to 2.9. Let's take a look at the data. Food at stores are increasing at a decreasing rate. This is a positive. No surprise here. Shelter inflation is up again. Transportation is no longer bringing inflation down. It is up and that is no surprise. Gasoline prices are up in the month of March. And guess what? The month of April will have the carbon tax, which is also going to bring this number even higher. 12-month change in CPI. We were going down and now we're going flat. Here are the numbers we have officially stalled out, and I'll tell you why at the end. Why did we increase the 2.9? It's gasoline prices. A clear sign or economy is not doing fantastic. Household furnishing and equipment is down and also footwear and clothing. It's because we don't have enough money for discretionary statistics. Canada has provided us a historical chart on clothing and footwear. I would say this is the health of our economy. If you take a look, we're weighed down. And the reason is people need to pay for shelter, and they also need to pay to eat. They're not buying shoes. And that's why I say our economy is not as great as what they're presenting us. If you want to know why inflation is an issue, all you have to do is look at the Bank of Canada's interest rates. They're causing 1% of the 2.9% inflation. Statistics Canada has actually provided us with a chart, so we could see how much mortgage interest costs is affecting inflation. This is mortgage interest costs. This is rental rates. They're bulk highly elevated, and it's because of the Bank of Canada's interest rates. So what's increased inflation this time around is gasoline. The problem is last year we had these low prices, we're way up here. Plus, we have not considered the carbon tax yet in May. We're going to get our April reading, which is going to have the carbon tax, plus the increase in oil prices. So why is the Bank of Canada not cutting interest rates if they're responsible for 1% of this, which would mean we would be below 2% inflation if they lowered mortgage interest costs? And the reason is probably what you expected. The federal government's budget, which is going to be highly inflationary, as well as oil and gas prices. With all the economic data, the market believes there will be a rate cut in June or July of 25 basis points. That is also why you could see a rapid decline in the loony. With the US economic data continuing to show bullishness, they're probably not going to cut interest rates they might actually increase it. So we need to monitor the Canadian loony.

Notice the fat lines on this filet and also notice that this salmon is labeled wild copper river sake salmon from central Alaska. So sake will never ever have any fat lines on it is a very, very lean fish. And generally the filets are also super, super red. So anytime you see a very dual toned filet of fish, it is probably sake. It will pretty much never be this color unless it's something that's been caught during a spawning season. But you really don't have to worry about that as a general consumer. What you need to look for is fat lines. And if it says it's sake, it means the store doesn't know what it's selling or it's misrepresenting what it is selling. Also copper river season is in the springtime. So whatever this fresh sticker is doesn't really mean anything. This is not freshly caught. It was frozen likely and then thought for display. And it's not sake anyway. So that kind of defeats the point of any of the stuff on the label. It's all lies.",subjective

They turn to me and before they got your paper. Because they laid me off. And they knew I'd be mine and boom. Well, the contractor from West Virginia that you worked at before there. Oh, you meet the same fucking contractor. He's just out of another local home. So then I call Miss Karen. She's the payroll lady for this. Send contractor. And I worked for this contractor under three different local unions. And I've had no problems with my payroll. So I believe Miss Karen. She said, no, we sent any in May 17th. But before she even got to paper for unemployment, because like I said, they was the one that laid me off. And they knew that we were one in the pool. So then they said, well, his show was here that you worked for this contractor in Ohio. Okay, well, you got my wages. Because I only worked for them two weeks. I had forgotten about it. Well, it looked like a dime age now, don't you? Well, his since here, man. We know him. And it's really them talking like that because they look like idiots. We've not got wages from West Virginia.

So they check you in that you're at that location for the week so you can't go to another one and then they give you a number with your household and then this one I go to I wait to be called down and I get a shopping cart and I literally get to shop based on the number that they gave me for my family. So like the number of the household that I have for my family there's like signs all around and you grab what you can per the number that they give you. So like if you have like a family of seven they'll have like a number seven and then like under it it's that you can grab like six to seven items and then it's like that for all like different families.

Now, what does it mean biomarkers? I mean to measure something Physiological one example of that might be that eye movement abnormalities have been observed in bipolar disorder So sometimes part of the diagnostic process for bipolar is measuring somebody's eye movements There have been other attempts using things like brain scans or measuring the levels of hormones or neurotransmitters But as it stands in most cases It's going to be a conversation or if you're lucky and hopefully a series of conversations with a mental health professional And so where does that leave us with the state of coming up with psychological phenomena? We can't measure anything concretely from the brain or the body to come up with diagnoses So what we're really basing our Definitions of mental disorders on our groups of behavioral traits or experiences So on that basis, yes, they are invented based on observation But the observations are Years of seeing the same traits cropping up together and cooling it a psychological phenomenon There is the possibility that in future generations as technology advances We will have a better grasp of how to measure particular biomarkers and associate them to psychiatric Diagnoses and in which case it could completely change the landscape of diagnostic criteria It's positive that depression for example in years to come is probably going to be broken down into many different distinct disorders Does that mean that the feelings and experiences of people who resonate with the current diagnostic criteria are any less valid? No, and doesn't mean that those diagnostic criteria are not helpful Well, they're not always helpful, but in a great many cases It helps us to hone in on the particular experiences and struggles of a patient so that we can more accurately help them And their particular needs there also people for whom the current diagnostic criteria do not resonate at all and that experience is also valid You know everyone's mental health journey is unique in a certain sense and as mental health care and science continue to evolve I think we'll be better equipped to help each person more effectively",subjective

@alexisanddean_video_7220469124319776046.txt," Hey babe, what's the SBA and how do I get an SBA loan? The SBA? Yeah, what's the SBA? The SBA is the small business administration. It's government agencies. How it works really is the SBA does a lot of things but their primary function is to help small businesses get financing pretty much. Financing for purchasing real estate financing for working capital financing for a company. Yes, it will complicate it. Yes and no. It depends on the lender. More often than not, no. More often than not. Standardized SBA lending needs. You need to have two years worth of operations in your company. Some banks can kind of push the limit. That gets to be complicated. From a high level, the SBA is there to help small businesses grow. Got it. How they do it really is through a loan guarantee program to the banks. What people don't realize when they talk about when they hear about the SBA is the SBA doesn't lend you money. The SBA guarantees loans that qualify under its guidelines and they guarantee loans for the banks. For example, when I do an SBA loan, we underwrite the loan. We qualify it based on the government guidelines. You check all the boxes. It gets pretty complicated. But what happens is the government gives us a guarantee percentage, a large percentage of the loan. At times more than 75% now it's like 75% of the project, whether it be purchasing equipment, purchasing real estate is guaranteed by the SBA. It allows the banks to take on more risk on these loans. Because SBA loans are usually for small businesses and small businesses risky. There are caps on it. There's like a 5 million cap per SS number of a guarantee. The max you as a person as a business owner can get. The SBA loan is 5 million. You can get a million on this company. 2 million for this. But me as a person I can only get 5 million. It gets eligibility and all that as a matrix it gets complicated. But that's the general way it works. There's two main types of SBA loans. It's called a 504 program and a 7A program. A 504 program is only for real estate. It's usually when the government comes in as a secondary lender on a real estate. For example you buy a 10 million dollar real estate for a warehouse facility or a manufacturing facility. You need to borrow 8 for example. 5 million or 7% is a larger percentage where the loan comes from the bank's money. Then there's a second loan in the back. That's an SBA loan to give more proceeds to the loan. Then there's a 7A program. It's more common. They call it the 7A program. 7A programs you can purchase real estate, equipment finance, working capital financing, inventory, blah blah blah. Everything. But the cap is still like 5 million. But the key thing is to understand is what the SBA is there for is to promote the lending. How they promote the lending is they don't lend their own money. They don't lend money. They guarantee loans for the lenders like banks like this. It makes us and we, for community reinvestment purposes and all banks as a requirement, we're encouraged to lend money by the government for these kinds of projects. You have to be in business for two-year startups. Some banks will do it. Some banks get a little bit complicated. If I want to get the SBA loan, how do I do that? I just call a banker. Do I ask for that? To see that's why they don't do a good job of disseminating this. Yeah, you call a business banking division or whichever bank you bank at. Our bank is a commercial bank. Pure commercial bank. We don't have consumer services or resident. We do have residential lending but we don't have consumer. Anything that comes in as a business loan, now another important thing about the SBA is you want to go buy a piece of real estate to invest in it. You cannot qualify. That's not considered. That's not eligible for SBA. It has to be an operating business. You have to borrow the money to purchase real estate for your operating business. Or if you need working capital for your business, it has to be an operating business, not a passive investment like real estate. I can keep going on and on and on. There's a lot of things involved in it. But the basics is if you need one, you should push things first. It's called whoever you bank, your business banks with and go from there. Okay.

So if you recall there was some uncertainty on whether to include these state payments on your federal income tax return which will mean that you will have to pay taxes on this money So the IRS is finally saying that you do not have to include these state tax payments on your federal income tax return Therefore having to pay taxes on it which makes a lot of sense because if you're going to provide me relief on the lens of a Disaster then don't turn around and try to tax me on that same money, right?

@victoria.therese_video_7299191293509422341.txt," I may be a psychic, but I did have a master's in political science of the concentration in public policy, so I just want to have a very serious conversation about how policy analysis rewired my brain to approach public discourse and just politics very differently. I feel like the way that I approach it is a lot more effective, and I understand how government works so much that I know my place and what are the important things to discuss and how to consider issues as we move forward. I think in the cusp of a potential revolution, I very much hope that people have a greater understanding of how policy works so that you can also make more efficient decisions and create better, better lasting change in the world. So let's get into the basics. What is public policy? I just like to define the thing that I start up with, but it's basically a practice and discipline of making tangible written rules that govern a group of people or society at large. It can also be a set of actions, plans, laws, behaviors adopted by a government, can also consider courses of actions and funding priorities, so a lot of these different things that are all involved. One of the things that really changed my life was realizing that in public policy, no decision is a decision, so that means that if a problem is brought into government and your government decides not to do anything about it, that is a government decision, okay? That may mean that they don't want to take accountability and they don't want to upset certain stakeholders or it may be too expensive or they may want it to simply uphold the current legislation that is affecting these things. There's also two really big consequences of policy or legislation being introduced from government who have the output and the outcome. Now why are these two so important is because the output is the direct effect of that legislation. So for example, you made something legal or illegal, but the outcome is also a consequence. What is the outcome? The outcome is the societal changes that are direct effects of that policy. So consider the fact that policy actually creates ripple effects. So in a very specific example, making abortion illegal makes abortion illegal, but it also creates high maternal mortality rates, higher likelihood of women having miscarriages being put in jail and being punished. And as we see in America, a lot of doctors leaving and moving to different states and actually collapsing maternal maternity care centers in the United States. I'm laughing because it's really, really scary. All of these things are consequences of policy. You also have to understand that something is very important is usually not one single thing that causes one other thing. Like there's not just like a single singular cause and effect. There's usually a lot of different factors that result in specific problems that governments need to address. Governments will also do this thing called cost benefit analysis. I didn't learn this in my policy program. I learned this like when I was reading a book, the happiness industry, William Davies. Jeremy Bentham is considered the father of public policy and Jeremy Bentham developed the happiness principle, like largest amount of happiness for the greatest amount of people. So a lot of the times, governments do kind of seek to adhere to that principle, but more often than not, we actually look at it regarding stakeholders. So stakeholders are essentially people that are for against and persuadable in this policy being introduced. Which means that it's not just civilians that we are affecting. It's also like, for example, corporations who feel like their different industries are being threatened and they may lose money. You can look like certain political figures who feel like they may like lose something in the stock market or they will lose donations from, you know, certain very wealthy stakeholders. So like wealthy people and people in power are typically considered stronger stakeholders. It doesn't mean that civilians and civilians that organize and also join interest groups or nonprofits or international organizations. They also matter a lot. And then you also have this thing called the cost benefit analysis. They will literally come up with a bunch of different solutions and they will also do the math to identify how expensive something is. All of these different things contribute to policy. Now, the thing that I find really annoying as somebody who is like super in favor of universal basic income is that poverty is like a lot more expensive than we just gave people like free money. And in Canada, corporate welfare is also one of the biggest parts of our Canadian budget. And they still don't have to pay taxes. That annoys me. Anyway, so those are just some of my random scattered thoughts regarding policy. If you have any specific questions, I hope I can answer them. If not, yeah.",subjective

@chaotic_hungry_video_7313543662082854174.txt," So the comments of that video have shown me that a lot of people don't understand the difference between a food bank and a food pantry Because they are very very different food pantries is a general term food closet food Whatever and these are the actual agencies in the communities where people go to pick up distributions of food This may be a church may be at a you know any kind of agency that runs these things the general collective term for this is food pantries And these are almost always an individual's access point to these services a food bank However is much different a food bank is generally a large organization that serves an entire region and is usually a warehouse situation where Millions of pounds of food are stored they run like distribution centers similar to like a Cisco or a Gordon's food service They source their food from very different places usually they get a whole soda nations and or wholesale purchase orders But they also get like the big boxes you see at grocery stores and that all gets inventory and stored on shelves or in coolers Food banks are also usually the ones who run Regions USDA commodities programs, so they store the food from the US government as well. There's usually one food bank for a big region For instance here in Tennessee there are five food banks across the country across the state and each of them serves about a fifth of the state and Almost always they're a part of an affiliate group with feeding America or some other agency like that that works nationwide and they might also have Regional associations that they talk to each other with so a food bank is the large macro Agency and the food pantries are the smaller agencies where people actually get service And the way this usually works is that a food bank will have partner agencies that are food pantries and food pantries can buy food from the food bank to Distribute usually it's pennies on the pounds so you'll say I want you know 10 cases of green beans and it will be like three to ten cents a pound and Most of the time almost all of that is just covering administrative costs and then because USDA commodities are usually free They will sometimes add on you know a little bit of costs for delivery I think it's like that most of the time it's free if you order something else and in my experience working in the food pantry It was it was usually like a lot of like you know every Tuesday or whatever You would have the chance to bid on food items that you know the other 300 agencies were also bidding on Which can make a tricky because even if we had usually around 700 customers a month and so If I'm gonna get something I want to make sure I've got at least 700 of them or an aggregate of 300 of this and 400 of that and in our case It was one of those things where the earlier we got our orders in from the sheet the more likely We were to get what we asked for now all that being said food banks Don't usually do direct service to clients, but there there's a lot of exceptions I've seen it to where food banks won't do regular distributions, but they'll do emergency services Most of them if you reach out to them they'll They'll tell you where your closest affiliate partner paint pantry is But if you just show up to a food bank looking for food, they're almost never gonna turn you away But that's just not their role in the system their role in the system is to be the aggregator and distributor to other smaller pantries That being said a lot of food makes now we're doing what are called mobile pantries Well, they will load up trucks full of food taking to specific locations that are predestined and pre-scheduled and do Distributions to people in their cars, but that takes a lot of effort and a lot of planning a lot of volunteer labor So to this comments point yes if you were donating directly to a pantry Money is still always better because money allows those pantries to have a better chance at getting what they need from the food bank Or going and buying themselves But if you know that a local pantry near you has a very specific need please go buy that Like if you're telling everybody we really need green beans go buy a case of green beans if they're asking for it But even in a case like this it still stands that they're more likely to be able to get the same products cheaper From the food bank or from the own from the grocery store that you're going to go to with your taxes and status So unless they're specifically asking you to buy things specific things for them It's still a better option to give them money because then they can also pay their staff with it Another really important thing to mention about this is that food banks can engage in a lot more Things like advocacy than food Patriots can often a food bank will have an advocacy arm that Advocates around things like snap and WIC and other food access programs They're also likely to have people on staff who do things like sign people up for snap this snap program Many of them have like a government relations arm where they have lobbyists on staff who do things like make sure that legislation that's being introduced in their region is not harmful to people who are in need of food They will also have staff whose job is to engage with partner agencies around the state Who do things like that and build those interagency connections to make sure that the food system as a whole Is stronger so food banks do a lot more than just provide food and actually as we're seeing right here in Davidson County Tennessee there are A lot of things they can do in the case of like something like a tornado for instance They are prepared to activate in situations of disaster and emergency and oftentimes what that means is just connecting with the Painteries in those areas where the emergency happened and making sure that they are set up for success for the people that are inevitably going to come Yeah, hope that helps",subjective

@kenoshayououghtaknow_video_7311191533955386667.txt," Hey, Kenosha. You ought to know that this coming Tuesday, December 12th is an important school board meeting. The school board meeting will be held at Indian Trails High School. And the reason for that is they're expecting a lot of people. It will be at this school board meeting that the district will decide or the school board will decide whether to accept the district's recommendation for right sizing. Right sizing is a fancy way of saying school closures. KUSD is looking to close a bunch of schools. They're doing it because they say of declining birth rate is causing a lot of schools to be under capacity and that this is not financially efficient and that they are facing a budget crisis. So they are proposing to close a lot of schools and change the school boundaries. So even if your child's school is not on the list of when the school is to be closed, it's possible that your kid could go to a different school because of the changes made to the boundaries. So let me really quickly go through which schools they are saying they're recommending to the board to close. For the elementary school it's Epsola, Jefferson, McKenley, Stacker, and Vernon. This is going to affect about 20% of the students are going to be displaced and have to change schools. For the middle school, they're talking about recommending closing Lincoln school. But on top of that, they are talking about closing Washington school and taking all the students as a whole from Washington and putting them at Epsola. That's going to impact about 15% of the students. For the high school, they're talking about closing Ruthir. They had a school board meeting, a special one a couple weeks ago at Ruthir where a lot of people gave very passionate speeches about why Ruthir should stay open. They had students, former students, current students, faculty members, all people saying that Ruthir and the program at Ruthir is really like changed the trajectory of their lives and is a very important school. So if you have kids in the district or are just a community member that cares about KUSD and what's happening, you should come to the school board meeting on Tuesday, December 12th at 7pm at Indian trails because you ought to know what's going on. All right, talk to you soon. Bye.",subjective
@britfoley_video_7207150968281042219.txt," Alright, so health insurance was definitely one of my biggest worries when I was considering taking time off from my job and I think this can be one of the main barriers for people who if they want to quit their jobs or maybe work a part-time job where there aren't benefits but there are a few options. So at my old job I had full health insurance benefits and then included dental and vision and I would pay like a subsidized premium each month. I think I paid probably like $55 and that would give me all my health insurance benefits and things like that. And then when I quit there's something called Cobra where you have the option to extend your current health insurance dental and vision plan for up to 18 months after you leave your job. You just are responsible for the whole premium. So that option I think altogether is like $340 a month which is obviously more expensive but it's a good option if you're maybe only going to be unemployed for a few months or you're between jobs and then in Massachusetts there's also Mass Health which is like a public insurance company and this is for people who qualify based on their income level or disabilities and it's basically a tiered system where you pay copays and premiums depending on how much your income is. And that's a victim as health but I do know that with like Obamacare I think there is a national health insurance system where there are different public insurance plans at different state by state. You could also just go to a private insurance company and rule and pay the whole premium yourself there. I assume that would be the most expensive option but I'm not entirely sure but yeah so few different options there I would definitely recommend looking into it before you quit your job and just see what works best for you especially if you have specific health needs or things like that.",subjective
@owneractions_video_7265666980923903275.txt," This could be the biggest news in the history of the SBA. Last week, the small business administration updated their guidelines for down payments when buying a business and they lowered the threshold to zero down. And here's how you can do it. So technically, the SBA requires you to make a 10% down payment or what they call an equity injection. But part or all of that can come in the forms of seller financing, meaning that the seller is making your down payment for you. And under the old rules, you are not allowed to have the seller make all of that down payment through their seller financing. But now you can. And for the seller financing to qualify, it only has to be on standby for 24 months. And what that means to be on standby is that you're not making principal or interest payments on that note for at least two years. And we do a lot of deals and we'll say, sellers are very open to that. They'll have no problem with 10% on standby for two years. I think those are pretty easy deals to make. For those skeptics out there, here's the direct wording from the SBA, pages 110 and 111 of their standard operating procedures. Now, most banks won't go to zero down. It's up to their discretion. They don't have to go all the way to the SBA guidelines. But we do know that there are lenders out there that will. And I probably would only expect 0% down if you have experience in the industry that you're purchasing or really good management experience. I don't think the banks are gonna do zero down for an absentee-owned business outside of your area of expertise. Check out our profile to see the types of businesses that you can buy. The SBA will lend you up to $5 million to buy these businesses. And you can sign up for a search assistant to find one of these businesses near you.

@kimmconn_video_7104639399253560578.txt," Today I wanted to talk about an aspect of solo travel safety that I feel is kind of rarely talked about, which is safety in transport. So when you're going between places, from a hotel to another hotel or hostel or airport, etc. So what I always say is to have at least two points of contact at all times. And by points of contact I mean people, companies or entities that are aware of, or at least are kind of semi-responsible for your safety. People organize your transfer from the airport through your hotel. So that way the transfer is obviously responsible for your safety, getting you to the hotel. And the hotel is responsible for the transfer as well. So no repeatable hotel who wants to get a good review would hire an untrustworthy driver. And the driver also wants to get jobs again from this hotel. So that gives you two points of contact for your safety. Also often book tours through my hotel as well. And if I don't book things through my hotel, I always try to book them online. So even better than having the hotel be one of your points of contact is having a large travel company online such as Viader or Get Your Guide. Also be responsible. Generally Viader get your guide, etc. They all vet all the tours that they list on there. So you can read reviews and you can be a little bit more confident in the safety of tours like that. And also rather than taking a taxi, always opt for Uber because Uber has a lot more responsibility over people's safety than just a random taxi that you don't even know what the company is. A transfer driver or a tour driver is coming to pick you up. Make sure you know the name of the driver. And when the driver shows up, ask him his name and make sure it matches. Make sure not to say, are you so and so because then they could just say yes, even if they're not. And they can get you in their car. That happens sometimes. You have to take a cab which does happen in some places. Just do your research and make sure you know the reputable cab companies in the area that you are know what their logos might look like. And make sure they always use the meter and try to check online what the distance and pricing might be so you could have a ballpark before you put in the cab. Taking public buses, they're usually fine. I find that the more crowded something is the less likely anyone's going to do anything crazy. So you're generally fine. But in order to maintain your two points of contact, try making friends with someone on the bus. If you can, if it's a country where English is not the first language, ask around if someone speaks English, confirm the destination of the bus. Then you at least have a friendly face. And if you have a hotel that you're going to maybe call the hotel and let them know your bus number. So at least they are aware of your whereabouts. When it goes for trains, just kind of ask people on the train. Maybe find a familiar face to chat with and kind of make a temporary friend. So that does kind of looking out for you. Always ask for help. I find that people are inherently good throughout the world. Obviously not all fingers, etc. But always ask for help. Preferably someone in uniform. And generally people will always want to look out for you and show you a good time in their country. For people aware of and caring about your safety, the better.

So I graduated with a public policy major from a liberal arts school and originally I declared public policy because my 19 year old brain thought, oh, this sounds interesting. I'm just going to declare my major but not even a consider what my career path is going to look like. But after taking community organizing classes environmental law and policy, urban policy, whatever and running entire year long senior thesis on public policy, I realized that I don't really like it. I realized, hmm, maybe I chose the wrong major. So I switched to marketing after graduation and actually I unknowingly went into marketing because I wanted to have graphic design jobs instead and somehow it's kind of correlated with marketing and I thought, oh, maybe if I do graphic design, it'll allow me to have a more creative outlet because I want to practice creativity. I've done marketing jobs after graduation, social media, graphic design, but never have I ever used my public policy degree. So yeah, I really admit that I took an O on that one because I spent thousands of dollars on a degree that I don't even use. But right now, I'm actually very relieved to know that my entire life isn't screwed just because I didn't choose the right major. Thank you very much.",subjective
@sheisapaigeturner_video_7245995446022245675.txt," Yes, it does. I know people don't want to believe it costs that much, but it absolutely does cost that much money. And I'll show you how. These are the rates in my town. This is for infants, so it's $110 a day. That's the lowest you can pay and that's if you're going for five days a week. The most you'll pay if you do one day drop in is $153. It drops when they become a toddler, which is 15 months old, and it drops even more when they become a preschooler, right? So $97 a day if you do five days, I think it's less and less as they get older, which is fantastic. But just for context, for one infant, one, and most people have two children. One infant for five days a week, $2200 a month. So when I tell you I have four kids and I pay $5,000 a month in childcare, not making that number up. That is the reality and the cost of childcare. For the people who are going to recommend, hey, you should do a nanny and nanny's way less expensive. It's also not, right? The more kids you have, the higher the rate is that they're going to charge you for childcare. So I have four children and we need 40 hours a week at a minimum. That'd be like $35 an hour at 40 hours a week, $5600 a month. So day care does cost this much and nanny does cost this much. Child care is an insanely expensive these days and inaccessible and I'm really tired of you older generation and I say that because this is Grammy, I'm really tired of them not acknowledging the fact that the cost for childcare is vastly different today than it was when they were raising kids.",subjective

I love your story, everything that you just said, you know, for the audience, we're trying to talk about marketing and finance and so one thing that I'm interested in is what are the economic trends and marketing insights for 2024? Great question. So next year, 2024 kind of comes down to two major scenarios that are being heavily debated right now. So you have the scenario one where we get a soft landing, where we avoid a recession, unemployment is low, and the Fed successfully tames inflation. Scenario two is we have a hard landing. We do have a recession, unemployment is high, and the risks associated with that are available in on the table. Is it a rolling recession? Has it happened yet? And a lot of times that word is kind of thrown out there with a lot of negativity or emotional weight, I would say. And I'm sympathetic to that because in a recession, there is economic pain, specifically in the form of unemployment or maybe bankruptcies. My family was impacted by the 08 recession. I'm sure you were in some way. And the reason I want to highlight this, though, is just to make sure people understand that recession is also, even though there are some hard parts about it, for sure, it's also a healthy and natural part of the economic cycle. So the economic cycle moves like an S curve. You go through a period of expansion and then peak and the contraction of recession and then trough and then expansion again.",subjective

So where are things that are light in color that are not taking up too much bandwidth with the busy pattern? Good lighting helps. Consider the patient's individual needs. If the patient needs an interpreter or another family member to be present, make sure you know how to merge those. For, develop a website manner.

It's called Feel Monitoring and we're doing this for disaster relief. We're in Perry, Florida. So the way you find these jobs on, indeed, or through word of mouth, doesn't really matter how you get here but to get here. I work for a company called Eisenhower-Russell. All they require for employment is the pair of steel tow-booms by vehicle, two forms of ID and that's it. No background checks, none of that. And you're in. Now the trick is staying in. You get out here and don't do well. You get put on standby. Anyway, here's what I do. See this truck over here? It's a dumpster. On the front, and a trailer on the back. I watch my driver fill this trailer and dumpster with debris and I write him a ticket. Well, I print him a ticket and then he goes to the dump. I put in about at least a minimum of 84 hours a week. The pay is okay. It's 2000 and up most times. But when you think about it and the grand scheme of things, it's only like maybe 18 bucks an hour. So to get that 2000 a week or so, you're putting a lot of hours and the hours are there. You're going to put them in every day between 11 to 13, 14 hours a day. And for a lot of us, that's really good pay. Some of us can't get jobs and to bring in 2000 a week is very decent. I did it because I got my insurance plans of Justice License when I left a medical school program last year. So I wanted to get out because I hadn't worked in a year and a half to see what it's like. And this helps my communities will flower the communities. Helping people clean up their communities is a pretty, it feels good on the inside. It's getting paid to do it. Feels even better.

@jesspaone_video_7286954414609337643.txt," Hey, just here, Dr. Genneth Hall, counselor at a Addiction slash Mental Health and Patient Facility. I pride myself on doing groups that are original and outside of the box. So yesterday, I used the artist Ren and three of his songs. The songs were High Ren, Chalk Outlines, and Sick Boy. And then I had the clients say how they could relate or what they got from each song. So Ren just wanted to let you know you are making a difference out here. And I wanted to share with you some of the words that some of the clients thought. For High Ren, voices in my head telling me I ain't shit. Me telling them I don't care when you say I'm awesome. High Ren really highlighted the intentional battle that takes place in individuals that suffer from various diseases. For me personally, I saw the negative, demented side of Ren as my struggle with addiction. High Ren, I've been living this way for so long. I can't tell the two personalities apart, understand the concepts, voices just sound the same. Another one, the entire chorus is wild for me. Every time I start to get a handle on, shit the other shows up to shit all over the place. And insist that I remember I'm worthless and that I need him to be valid anyway. For chalk outlines, I related this to loss of self, loss of identity, and killing myself slowly through addiction. I erase myself when I am using. I am not who I want to be and do not live up to my values while I'm in active addiction. I'm dying and watching everyone around me taking meds that put me in a funk and not a fun guy to be around. I quit one addiction just in place of another. I felt like he was trying to convey sense of hope at the start, but fighting to keep himself together and not one empty. Not an empty shell. Another part is that he feared being okay and I constantly have to fight daily to be and to stay okay. And then for sick boy, it seemed to relate to a trauma loop and loss of patience with no immediate fix. This is the same type of story for my life. A lifelong problem that has no quick fix and requires patience, diligence, dealing with past trauma. Sick boy, this is obviously about tree-minimum mental illness. Although this person themselves has not had a lot of experience with mental health prescriptions outside of anxiety and depression, I've heard stories of people having their meds changed and hearing one thing from a doctor and something different from another one. Another feedback for sick boy. In this song, I heard my own thoughts about the many bad experiences I've had with the mental health, slash substance abuse, industrial complex over the past 30 years. The reason I'm sharing all of these are because for me as therapists, there's nothing worse than running a bad group and there's nothing worse than sitting through a bad group as a client. I try to take a different approach with some of my clients and I try to make the groups engaging and make them thought-provoking and get them to feel something. So, yesterday we showed the video high-read twice. The first time, they were just watching it. The second time, they really had to engage with it and give me their feedback. They had a written assignment to do yesterday where they told me how they related to it. Ren, I just want you to know, you gained a lot more fans in here. They've been asking for more of your songs because they felt the emotion that was coming through it. You're a very talented artist and I would like to thank you for making a difference for not only individuals with mental health but also for individuals like me with substance abuse and we constantly fight our demons, the good versus the bad. And we need more focus on that. Thank you.",subjective
@www.check1two.com_video_7300632751831633182.txt," Good morning. So I came up with another idea and this is a way to stabilize the our current monetary system that's in place now. So what happens is that you have you know like the International Monetary Fund with countries and stuff that agree to work together and so that you have these waves of inflation right. So inflation happens and then everything crashes and then people lose everything. They lose their houses, their cars, their trucks, their businesses, their ability to earn and then everybody goes out of business even banks you know so it hurts the whole economy and then the banks end up with all this junk you know like they don't really want and I'm not saying junk but I'm just saying they don't what do they even do with all these trucks or houses so then everything just devalue it's and now everything's worth nothing you know so for example if you bought a truck during COVID it was very expensive 100 grand and now the same trucks worth 50 grand so to stabilize all this stuff what we should do is maybe when the money has less value then your loans also have less value so instead of owning a hundred grand now it's 50 grand instead of your payments being 3,000 or 1,500 and that allows people to keep their houses, keep their businesses, keep their stuff and then it doesn't hurt the economy or the government because if people lose all that stuff then they can't meet their obligations and you keep having these waves of you know inflation crash and inflation crash and you know over and over and over but by doing it that way where when if stuff costs more like if the money has more value your loans should stay the same if money has less value your loans should be less that way people can maintain their obligations and that would help the whole economy it would help everybody it would help all the governments all the banks you know because even banks go out of business and it's it's really sad because I'm sure those people spent lots of money and lifetimes you know to be able to do that little business and then they lose it all and it's just you know this will be a way to stabilize it and keep our current monetary system strong and you know hope you like the video and let me know what you think in the comments thanks for watching",subjective

It was caused by a combination of factors, including the explosion of the subprime mortgage market in the United States, where many people were given loans they couldn't afford, and risky financial practices by banks and other financial institutions. This led to the failure of several major banks and financial institutions, which in turn caused a global recession. The crisis also had ripple effects around the world, leading to economic turmoil in countries across the globe. The US government intervened, bailing out several large banks and financial institutions in an attempt to stabilize the market, but the crisis still caused widespread panic and led to the loss of jobs and homes for many people.

So if you have 100 units, you want it to be gone as soon as possible. But you want to also have your inventory from your manufacturing show up in time to replenish your inventory that's sold. That's really where all supply chain comes in. You want to make sure that by the time that your order is gone, you have stuff to replace it and you're constantly moving in a cycle where your inventory is flowing in and out. If you can strike a balance of understanding when to order your inventory so you're not sitting on a whole bunch of stuff in your warehouse or extra bedroom, then you're going to be in a really good spot.",subjective

Any week you worked less than 30 hours, for that particular week you count the number of hours you worked. I'll give you an example. Say a student came to Canada in September 2019, from 1st September 2019 to 2020 December 2019, that person was working 20 hours a week for 16 weeks, so that's a total of 320 hours. During the winter break the student worked from 1st December 2019 to 6th January 2020, for 40 hours per week for 2 weeks. But the total number of hours you will count is 60, 30 times 2 is 60, because you won't count any number of hours over 30. For every week you will count the number of hours you actually worked, and for any week you worked over 30 hours, you will count 30 hours for that week. At the end you will add up all the hours to a total, and that total should be greater than 15, 60 or 15, 60.

@backwardshatbarrister_video_7358585023328455978.txt," Did you know that you might be eligible for a quicker approval for disability benefits from the Social Security Administration? Now the first thing that I want to tell you about this program that is called presumptive disability is that it only applies to SSI applicants. So this does not apply to people who are applying for Social Security disability insurance only, which are the benefits that are based on your work record and paying into Social Security. SSI is a government welfare benefit for people who are disabled. Now presumptive disability payments are only available to applicants who have a remarkably high chance of being approved. This generally applies to people who are much older when they're applying for SSI benefits or people who have a very severe, maybe terminal health conditions. This list is non-exhaustive, but some examples of medical conditions that might qualify for presumptive disability payments are amputations, total blindness, total deafness, cerebral palsy, down syndrome, a severe intellectual disorder as an adult, or perhaps something like ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease. So very clear, most people watching this video will not qualify for presumptive disability payments. Now to receive presumptive disability benefits, you must submit a disability application through this standard process, and it's important that you provide medical evidence, some medical evidence at the very outset. That's going to be your best chance of having it flagged by Social Security as saying, once we do a full medical review, this claim has a great chance of being approved, so we're going to do a presumptive disability. So the decision to grant presumptive disability payments is solely at the discretion of the Social Security Administration. As an attorney, I can beg, I can plead, but the chances of me getting them to PD one of my clients is very rare. It's very, very different. Umptive disability payments can be provided to somebody who is applying for disability benefits for up to six months while the Social Security Administration makes a final decision on disability. So let me be clear, when somebody is awarded presumptive disability payments, that does not mean that they are approved. It means that Social Security thinks there's a high likelihood that they're going to be approved. So they are agreeing to pay that person while they are undergoing medical review. It is very possible, and I have seen this happen, where Social Security does presumptive disability payments for somebody and then later takes away benefits when they do a full medical review and finds that they are not disabled. You do not need to pay back these benefits if that happens to you. If you have a question about presumptive disability payments or you want to know if you have a condition that's likely to qualify, follow me and leave a comment, and I'll be sure to respond to you.",subjective

@humphreytalks_video_7319297293251890474.txt," Three things that you guys should be doing financially that's easy as fuck to do. And honestly, if you're just doing these three things, you're gonna save yourself a lot of money and you're not costing yourself any money by not doing these. All right, the first thing is a high yield savings account. It's the same thing as a normal savings account, but it just pays you a much higher interest rate for having your cash in there. So right now they're paying about 5%, 4.5% for a lot of the good ones. And so if you're not touching any of that cash, so let's say you have some money in an emergency fund, it might as well be in a high yield savings account that is actually generating you some interest. The next thing is to have a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is an individual retirement account where you put in after tax dollars. But as a result, when you invest in the Roth IRA, all of your earnings are going to be tax-free. So you're not taxed on any of the gains that you make in that account. So let's say you have Apple stock in the Roth IRA, I don't know, and let's say in 50 years, it like, you make like $2 million from it, you don't pay any taxes on those gains if you put it in a normal brokerage account, you might owe 30 to 40% in taxes. The last thing is in emergency funds, you want to have between three to six months of living expenses saved up. Obviously, if you can have more, that's even better. The best part of an emergency fund in my opinion is that you're not worried about, let's say, a $300 vet bill or maybe a speeding ticket or something like that. It's not going to ruin your day. And the thing is, it gives you a lot of freedom and flexibility to perhaps look for different opportunities. You don't really have your back against the wall if you're living paycheck to paycheck. It is something that just gives you a lot of peace of mind and allows you to kind of operate in a position of power and so don't undervalue that position of power because of the emergency fund. I'm going to make another one of these videos tomorrow on a financial tip, so I hope you come back.",subjective

But what we're not going to do is throw her away. Hi, I'm a microbiologist and while I totally get the thought process here and I respect it, I also love cheese. I am here to give you some bad news in that removing fungus from your cheese in this way isn't a safe way to deal with it. However, I can give you some information on a safer way to do this. It's not 100% safe. There is still going to be risk, but it's definitely better than what we saw in that clip. So something really important to understand about fungi is that they kind of are like icebergs in that the tip what you see sticking out of the water is not most of the iceberg. It's actually a very small fraction of it. We can use the same rule for fungus. Pretend this is a block of cheese. I don't care. Use your imagination. Oh no. Mold. So while we see a white dot on the surface of our cheese, what this actually reflects is fungus burrowing into the cheese. We just can't see it. Key takeaway. What you see is a very, very small fraction of what is actually there. So when we look at that clip where we have a block of cheese where every surface is covered in several large colonies of mold, what do you think this means for what the inside of the cheese is like? I'm just anoculated herself with so much fungus. This is where I tell you the safer way to do this. However, before we get there, I have to give a disclaimer. The following information is not a professional recommendation. I personally do not do this. However, I understand that we live in an imperfect world where a lot of people are poor and hungry. If you can't afford to throw out a block of cheese or a loaf of bread, I understand. The following, again, is not formal advice. It's just information that you decide what you're going to do with as it is up to you and only you, the level of risk that you are comfortable with assuming when it comes to food safety. And of course, if you have a history of fungal allergies or you are immunocompromised, you absolutely should not do this. In the event that you have a solid piece of food example, not shredded cheese, and you find a single isolated colony on the surface that's small, like pencil eraser size or smaller, not the size of like a quarter. You can remove 1.5 to 2 inches from that, discard the food and your risk for getting food poisoning is lower. It is not 100% gone. There is still a risk for food poisoning for mycotoxins, but it is lower than, for example, if you have a block of cheese covered in mold and you just shave it off and eat it anyway. I understand why people are led to simply remove mold from their food before eating it. Just understand that shaving your food is not the best method and there's always going to be some risk.

My name is PageSparks, I'm an employment lawyer, but my law partner does a lot of consumer protection law, so like illegal car repossessions. Given the current market and interest rates, we are anticipating a lot of repose to happen this coming year. During the pandemic, a lot of cars were sold to people that had no business buying it. They didn't do the proper checks. They didn't even check credit or finish all the paperwork for some of our repokases we have right now. I know missing a car payment is embarrassing, but don't let the repo people bully you and make sure you know your rights. The repo companies have a ton of rules they have to follow because they're repossessing property. So for example, if they don't send the proper notice before they repossess the car, it may be an illegal repossession. If they threaten you or disturb the peace in any way while they're repossessing the car, that's another violation. If your car gets illegally repossessed, don't be embarrassed, talk with the consumer protection lawyer and let them know everything that happened, that way they can see if there was any violation of law. If there was a violation, we can see certain damages like asking for your car back, your stuff back, and then additional money for your attorneys fees and the inconvenience since they broke a law.

And that's why so many of us remain stuck because we're constantly trying to think our way out of things instead of feeling and tapping into the inner guidance. And the last thing, number three, is I'm a firm believer because this has been my experience. We don't choose our purpose. We don't just choose some random thing we want to do in life. It's about tuning into the inner guidance and following our calling, our consciousness, our intuition is literally calling us in a certain direction.

@a_biology_teacher_video_7162891991011937578.txt," I think we need to talk about this trend that I've seen in education recently. And that trend is to make classes 100% virtual or online. Let me make sure I say this right. I think we can collectively agree that online education was not the most beneficial for students learning over the past couple of years. It was definitely needed during certain points during the pandemic, but most of the data coming out right now is showing that student achievement is a lot lower right now. And there are many factors that go into that. But one of them is definitely online education. Now I do think that online education does have a place, but I've seen a trend in school districts to start making classes that are all online. The problem I'm having with this trend is teachers are already overwhelmed and stressed. There's a national teacher shortage and there are so many open positions that are not filled. Teachers are overwhelmed with just everything that's going on with an education. Four-seem teachers to make an all online class on top of everything else they're dealing with is just one more thing that's going to push more teachers out of the profession. I just think we need to have a bigger conversation about this trend.

@rachelle_summers__video_7208304215591095557.txt," Borderline personality disorder and fear of abandonment. Let's talk about it. Borderline personality disorder belongs to the cluster B personality disorders alongside histrionic, narcissistic and anti-social personality disorders. What they all share is erratic and dramatic behaviors, but one of the characteristic traits that sets borderline aside from those other cluster B PDs is this fear of abandonment. Of course nobody enjoys being abandoned, but for somebody who has borderline personality disorder, the level of emotional distress that they will experience in response to abandonment, either real or imagined, is going to be much, much higher than somebody who doesn't have borderline personality disorder. And in fact, part of the reason that people who have borderline personality disorder have an unstable sense of self is because they wrap their identity around how other people are feeling about them. So I'm a good person, if you tell me I'm a good person. I'm attractive if I'm constantly receiving reassurance to tell me that I'm attractive. For example, in the face of rejection or abandonment, this entire structure of identity can just collapse and it can feel like evidence that you are not worthy of love. In many cases, people who have borderline personality disorder have experienced some form of rejection or abandonment during critical stages of development. That's not always the case. Sometimes people who have borderline personality disorder are mirroring behaviors and traits that they saw in parents or caregivers. But these early life experiences of abandonment can be anything. It could even be a parent that passes away. Events that happen during childhood can very often affect the development of our brains. So one example is that the brain of somebody with borderline personality disorder, the amygdala will be more reactive in response to negative faces compared with somebody who doesn't have that disorder. Meaning that they're kind of always on the lookout for mood changes in the people around them, of course, being a possible signal for upcoming abandonment or rejection. If you love somebody who has borderline personality disorder, it will be very important for you to learn how to give very clear and consistent reassurance over time. Borderline does tend to get better as people age, especially in the presence of a strong support network and therapy. But it will be particularly important inside of a romantic relationship that there is a strong foundation of support and that they can ask for reassurance when they need it, which is likely to be often. And if you have borderline, let this be a small reminder that you are worthy of love despite what your brain is trying to tell you.",subjective

Since I graduated high school, the last time I lived somewhere for, sort of, what, three years was when I was 19. And when I left my mom and house, I made that shit like I was, I was one of those people like, yo, yo parent, they single parents, whatever the case may be, but once you're grown, you gotta find you somewhere else to go, type shit. So I was that child that was like, oh, I'm gonna find me somewhere to go and I'm gonna make this shit work. And I did. All of these years been motherfucking moving every year you could think of. And sometimes in the middle of the year, sometimes like it is just an ongoing cycle. So currently, I'm really just in a phase where I'm uncomfortable. And I say that to say, I'm not where I want to be. I'm still in school. I still have a lot going on. I still got another year left. So in things can change in the matter of a day, a year, a month.

First, mental health relapses happen and it does not mean that all your progress was just thrown out the window. It does mean that change is possible and you can do it. So learn to rest and don't quit. You can reset, readjust, and refocus as many times as you want. Second, your anxiety and depression is lying to you. There are so many more options than what your symptoms are convincing you is available. Learn to recognize the difference between your feelings and the facts in front of you. Once you learn to observe that space, you can start dialing into what you do get to control. Third, anxiety and intuition can seem similar. Anxiety is more of a consistent what ifs. Intuition is more of a consistent state of knowing. Four, what we resist persists and this is true with emotions as well. If we don't speak it, then we have to store it and that just gets plain heavy. Learn to get it off your chest, even if it's writing in a journal or talking to a pet. Fifth, it's okay to not be okay.

What is going to happen to them? Because right now, if you don't know, I believe the figure is something around 35% of black workers and 40% of Latino workers have the necessary digital skills to not only do their current job effectively, but to transition successfully to a new job that pays them better. And at a time when the pace of development in the artificial intelligence sector is outstripping our ability to successfully communicate it and then actually leverage it as the development is going on, what is going to happen to all these workers? Is the current skill the divide is going to get worse? Is there going to be a new tier of the skills divide? Probably some kind of combination of the two, but regardless of what the outcome is, it really highlights to me just how we sleep at the wheel our policy makers are. As it relates to making regulations, making policies, and ensure that not only will the benefits of this new economic mode be equitably distributed, but even just the ability to participate in it will be equitably distributed or equitably enabled because if the current skills divide is so bad when the primary mode we're talking about is the internet and just computers at all, how the fuck are we expecting that these people can catch up and participate in an AI fueled economic boom? I think the answer is that policy makers don't really give a shit if they can, which should not surprise anybody of course because most of America's policies are based in either explicit or implicit, but basically still explicit racism. And it sucks, it sucks ass because at the same time that you have tech bros, just ranting and raiding about the sort of utopia, about the sort of sheer boom that AI poses, you don't really hear them talking about the fact that there's already whole classes of workers that can't even enjoy the form of the world.

A lot of y'all know that I took care of my husband's Aunt Billy and she's like, she's fixed to be 90, okay? And I moved her in our house years ago, but mother is the one that told me all these things that helped and she's going to tell you about good old deodorant right here. When you use deodorant on an elderly person, if you will put it in the coccyc area that is towards your back, towards the crack area, there's an area there that will stay moist and you want to keep that dry. Putting deodorant there will make sure that that skin does not break down to begin with and that is usually the number one place that elderly people will have a skin breakdown. And by doing that, that really keeps all of that area dry and you won't have that problem. So that's the number one thing I recommend you do if you are an overweight lady and you can apply that underneath the breast, underneath the abdomen and in the groin area that will keep all of those areas dry to where you won't have the chafing of your skin which tends to cause your skin to break down. And my husband's Aunt Billy, okay, she's probably ever bit of 80 pounds. Mother's something to put deodorant on her on her backside because she's so bony and Aunt Billy's never had a bed sore. Never had a bed sore. It'll stop them from catching bed. They won't get any bed sores. I took care of both my dad and my husband. My husband was bony like Aunt Billy and my dad was heavy like myself. Neither one of those had any skin breakdown and when I would take them to the hospital, they would say their skin is in amazing condition. So remember to do that's very helpful. Yes. Another thing you've taken care of, I don't know if you have time for the yoga one, but if another thing is a lot of elderly people who have diabetes, they get yeast infections. Yogurt. Get them plain yogurt. Okay. Right, mama? Right. That is right. Literally apply it to the infected area. It will stop the irritation, itch and itch and itch. It takes the redness away.",subjective
@goatforreal216_video_7270582651218873646.txt," All right, so this goes to show that banks are just as shady as car dealers, maybe even worse. So this article goes on to talk about how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has found auto lenders that have kept money that they should have paid back to consumers that is tied into what's called power booking by car dealers. So what's power booking? So power booking is when a car dealer sends an application over to a lender and they lie about the equipment on the car. They say that it's got a moonroof or it's got leather interior or something like that. Something to increase the value. So when the deal gets sent over to the lender, it looks like a better deal to the bank. Maybe it's because of loan to value or it can be done just to increase profits by the car dealer, okay? So it's illegal. It still goes on in the car business, unfortunately, by unscrupulous dealers. But what's happening is this. So these lenders are finding these dealers that have power book vehicles, right? So they're saying, okay, well, you lied to us about the equipment on the car. So it gave you a loan for X amount of dollars based on that value of that car. However, we realize now through customer interviews and some other sources that they have other avenues that the vehicle may not have had all those options, okay? So they're doing what's called charging back the dealer. So they're sending a charge back to the dealer, which usually requires the deal. We've got to check back to the lender in the amount that they lied about the value or power book, the car, okay? It does happen by accident occasionally, too. But when dealers get caught doing this, they happily ready to check back to the lender, say, you know what, our mistake, you know, don't cut us off, you know, don't get us into any trouble, you know, we messed up. So they'll kind of check back to the lender. Now, that lender gets to check back to the dealer, lowering basically their exposure on that loan with the consumer, you know, due to the loan amount or whatever. What should happen is that lender should then go to that automotive loan for that consumer, and they should cut back the amount financed and how much interest is paid on the vehicle that was figured at the higher value. So the amount of interest figured on the loan, you know, when it was securitized, you know, was X amount of dollars, that was based off of a higher dollar amount of sale because the vehicle had a higher value due to the power booking. However, the lenders were not doing this. They were not, they were getting it checked back from the dealer, or for decreasing and minimize their risk on the loan and putting them in a better position on the loan because they got a refund back from the dealer. They should have then went back and decreased the amount of interest that was going to be charged on that loan due to the fact that it was lower because they got a, you know, a check back from the dealer that would go against the loan. So they're, again, their exposure there was a little bit less. So they should have went back and readjusted the interest on that loan at the lower amount. However, the lenders were not doing that. So they were in essence getting money back from a dealer, minimizing their exposure on the loan, and then they should have went back and took the interest that was figured at the higher dollar amount of finance and reduced the loan or reduced the interest amount on that loan that the consumers should pay in their payment or whatever. However, they were not doing that. So they'd like to say, oh, you know, it was an oversight or something like that, but these people make billions of dollars by being accurate with money, by being accurate and how much their exposure is on loans, auto loans, you know, whatever it is. So believe me, they have the controls in place that would have allowed them to catch this and they should have went back and done the right thing and adjusted the amount of interest paid by the consumer on the lower dollar amount. However, they didn't. So again, you'd like to think that it was an oversight, but banks don't normally make oversights when it comes to their money, their exposure and the risk, and the interest that they're going to collect on a loan.

Chicken meat, like all meat and animal tissue, is porous. It holds onto bacteria so when you run water over it, we are removing a small amount, but most of the bacteria is still there and the best way to make it safe to eat is cooking it to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. What does happen when we run water over meat is that we aerosolize that bacteria. We spread it all over ourselves. It splashes onto our counters, onto sponges that might be near our sink. In fact, bacteria that has been aerosolized by water can spread up to three feet away from your sink. I don't know what your kitchen looks like in the context of my home. Anything from my sponge to soap bottles, my microwave, the watering can handle, or even my paper towels are potentially left contaminated by salamanella or other bacteria in the meat. Career did make a second video, somewhat responding to some of the comments she was getting, being like, I'm confused, I wash my sink out, which is a good thing. We should be cleaning the areas of our kitchen that we use for food prep, including our sinks, however. Cleaning out your sink or bleaching your sink does nothing for the bacteria that you spread onto yourself, onto services three feet away from your sink, or into the air. The USDA actually performed an observational study regarding washing meat in the home, and they found that of people who washed poultry 60% had bacteria in their sink after washing, and 14% still had bacteria in their sink even after sanitizing and cleaning their sinks. So if the bacteria is still in the sink after you clean it, there's probably a lot of bacteria on surfaces that haven't been cleaned that are within that three feet radius. I understand that a lot of the people who wash their poultry are simply trying to remove the slime, or that pro-tenacious layer that's produced by the muscle. If this bothers you, the best way to deal with it is simply patting it dry with a paper towel. Food safety is also better to assess the safety of the meat, as meat that has spoiled or has bacterial overgrowth, the point where it's no longer safe, won't come dry from the paper towel, and what does come off will be like a yellow green color. I promise you, salmonella is not something you want to experience. Even once, and with an infectious dose that can be as low as 10 individual organisms, it's just not worth the risk. Food safety is really important knowledge for everyone to have, as we will all inevitably have to eat food, prepare food, weather for ourselves, or for other people, and best practices for food safety are one of the primary ways to avoid foodborne illness. Thanks for watching, and I hope you learned something new.",subjective

@animal.track2_video_7358519029696351531.txt," Why is it risky to lay steel coils flat when hauling them? It's actually safer to keep them upright. Handling steel coils requires utmost caution. Because if you have to break suddenly, the consequences could be disastrous. One reason why laying steel coils flat is a no-go is their sheer weight. A single coil can weigh up to a dozen tons. If you lay them flat on the truck bed, all that weight would bear down on the bottom, putting strain on the structure and supports, potentially distorting the coils themselves. Another reason is the complexity of handling them. You need specialized equipment like cranes to precisely locate and secure the coil's core for lifting these heavy loads. If they were laid flat, the equipment wouldn't find suitable positions, making handling even more challenging. So, clearly, standing them upright is the way to go. And it optimizes truck space usage too. But securing them properly is also a skill. Some drivers opt for quick fixes. Only to find coils loosening or breaking on the road with dire consequences. Do you have any good tips for safely and effectively transporting steel coils?",subjective

@blind.to.billionaire_video_7342788021391019307.txt," Automatic $1,400, 4th stimulus check in 2024 as the economy is crumbling. I have all the details and exactly what you need to know, right here in the video. Let's get right into it. I know in this video I do want to focus on a $1,400, 4th stimulus check right here right now in 2024 and I do want to share with you the details of what I just got done reading in regards to what they're suggesting is likely going to happen over the coming months. As we all recognize right now is a very busy time and it's also a very important time because we all know what's happening in November. Do you think they're going to allow the economy to go down in a ball of flames just months before November and what's happening then? Well again, I want to share with you the details of what they're suggesting and why this is so incredibly important because if you've been in the camp of somebody that wants a 4th stimulus check right now for 2024 and over the last couple years to be real, well then this is good news and something you certainly want to hear about. Let's get into it and I'll explain all the details, what I just got to done reading and what all this means for this year right now 2024. Really fast before we do. Thanks for joining me.

And also feel free to share the video with your friends, family, social media. There's a share button right down below the video as well. Again, we've got to stick together right now and the more people we have here in this community, the bigger the influence and impact we have. Anytime we reach out to lawmakers asking them for very important things because the low income and fixed income and virtually all Americans here have been really, really struggling financially the last couple of years. You've seen all the reports and studies I've shared with you over the last couple of years here. Yeah, not a good situation, which by the way, we have well over $1 trillion just in credit card debt in this country. That's massive. Every single time we get the new report to come out, it's a new record of credit card debt. That is not a statistic that we want to have. Okay, again, why do we think this is happening? Because nobody has any money. Their floating balance is on credit card. So again, that's a one other topic. We're not going to discuss that here in this video. But again, you've heard me talk about this stuff before. It's a bad situation out there. Anyway, let's talk about what's going on here. And again, why I say automatic stimulus checks. Now, here's the thing. Let me point out the details of some information that I was just reading. And again, why I want to bring this here attention. Now, stick with me for a minute here. You're going to think at, you know, first glance here. Wait, what does this have to do with anything to do with stimulus checks? It has 100% to do with it. Okay, let me explain the details about this. Now, remember, it's all about the economy. Okay, that is literally what it comes down to every single time. You've heard me say that before. If you've been watching the video, you're on the channel. You know what I'm talking about. I say this all the time, which is it's all about the economy. But most importantly, it's about jobs. Okay, this is really what it comes down to. The job market and unemployment numbers are really basically like the dog or the, yeah, basically I look at the dog that wakes it up. Okay, so it's very, very important. So either way, let me share with you what I just got done reading. They're anticipating within the next few months here, basically sometime between right around mid-summer or so. Again, it could be give or take a little bit here, but they're anticipating by mid-summer, we're likely going to be in a major, major economic recession, economic contraction. And they likely see unemployment going up to about 5.5%. Now again, you might be thinking, okay, we don't care. But what does this have to do anything with the distribution of another stimulus check? It is 100% predicated on this. Now, this is very, very important because the higher that we see the unemployment rate go, it simply means more people are out of work. It simply means that more businesses, big, medium, and small are cutting back on hiring. Maybe they're going bankrupt, maybe they're closing. There's a whole variety of factors. So when we start to see the unemployment rate ticking up, that's not a good sign, right? It simply means that the economy is contracting in a pretty big way. And remember, as of a few months ago, there's about 186 million people in the workforce in the United States, okay? Even an uptick of unemployment by say 1.5% or 2% is a lot of people. That's millions upon millions of people, right? When there's 186 million people in the workforce, and we're talking to say a 2% increase in the unemployment rate over several months here, that's big. That's very, very big, okay? That's very important to understand because we're talking some serious people here. We're talking millions upon millions of people that are losing their jobs. That's not a good situation. Again, is that a sign of a healthy economy when people are losing their jobs? No, okay? You don't need to be an economist. You don't need to be a statistician, anything like that to understand. Jobs being lost means the economy is not doing great, right? It simply means we're not an expansionary period of time, right? Now, something else I want to point out as well. We've been seeing for a while now. Remember, the last year and a half, actually, it's been longer than that to be fair. It's been a long time now. Well over a year and a half, the Federal Reserve was aggressively raising interest rates, right? In fact, over about a little more than a year's time, they raised interest rates 525 basis points or 5.25%. That's a lot. That is like historic, okay? They've never done that, okay? That's very, very important. Now, do you think this is going to contract on the economy? Yep, sure is, okay? Now, here's what else they're suggesting and what I discussed in reading as well. In these reports, now they've said that generally aggressive interest rate hikes like this out of the Federal Reserve generally take about 18 months to actually see the effects on the economy. Well, guess what? That's about right here right now. And that's about mid-summer is when they're anticipating this to all happen, okay? So they're anticipating these massive unemployment spikes up to about 5.5% give or take a little bit. And we're likely going to see all the effects of this 525 basis point rate hike from the Federal Reserve likely hitting the economy sometime around mid-summer. Give or take a little bit.",subjective
@mariedoesstuff_video_7328186584212327722.txt," If you ever eat reheated rice, you're putting yourself at risk of being really, really sick and maybe dying. And it's called reheated rice syndrome. So that's something that comes across my FYP every so often. And then you'll go to the comments and people will be like, I eat reheated rice all the time. I've never been sick. And also, fried rice is a thing that you do commonly, and a lot of cultures all over the world, with your leftover rice. So what's the problem? So let me give you the microbiology background. So let's think of this from a controlling microbial growth perspective. Most things that are going to cause human disease have an optimal growing temperature between about 20 degrees Celsius and 30 degrees Celsius. Most things, not all things. So that's room temperature to just under human body temperature. So that means don't ever let your food that needs to be cooked sit out at room temperature. You don't want it to be at that level of temperature for any length of time. It's either cooked and you are eating it hot or it's been refrigerated and it has stayed cold. You're not leaving it here for hours and hours, that idea. So with rice, what can cause the reheated rice syndrome is one organism specifically called bacillus serious. It's on the same branch of the microbial family tree as things like anthrax and botulism, antetnus, and cdiff. And what all of those have in common is that they can create something called an endospor, which is when the bacterial cell decides to hold up because there's not enough water or the temperature isn't right or there's not enough nutrients around. So it just kind of dries itself out into this almost like little seed and it's just going to wait until things are good. So if those spores are around in your rice, they can resist the cooking temperature at your rice. But then when your rice hits that 20 to 30 degrees Celsius, they're going to say, oh look, there's plenty of water. The temperature is just right and look at all this food and they're going to go crazy. And when they start growing, they are going to make this toxin that will make you very ill and want to throw up. Well, you throw up, not just want to throw up. You have to throw up. It's a medic. So why is this particularly bad with reheating your rice? Well, if you have cooked your rice and then let it sit at room temperature for very long and then put it in the fridge and then go to recook it and you think you're fine because you've cooked it again. No, because you still have spores around that perhaps you didn't germinate the spores the first time around, but now you did. And the second time around or the first time around you did germinate spores, you gave them enough time to grow and create a lot of toxin and then you reheated. Reheating does nothing to the toxin. The toxin is still around will still make you ill. So the biggest lesson that you should take away from this is wash your rice because not only does it have heavy metals and other dirt and stuff, it has these spores on it. So wash your rice. You won't get rid of all of the spores, but you'll reduce your chance of this happening. And second thing is this goes for any food. Don't let it sit out at human body temperature. And if you ever have heard the myth that you can't put hot food in the fridge, it's a myth. Go ahead and put warm food in the fridge. The only exception to that might be that don't put enormous amounts of very hot food in the fridge because it's just not going to cool efficiently. Right? The whole point of this is that you're trying to avoid that middle ground. You either want your food hot or you want your food cold. Don't leave it right here. That's where things grow. There you go.",subjective

@davebondy_video_7317316200348896555.txt," Okay, government waste. This just coming in. Take a look at this right here. This is happening in Michigan. I'm sure it's happening in other states as well.

Almost 6,000 people under the age of 15 got 90 million and 1200 almost 1300 people over the age of 85 got 18 million. So where is this money going?

@theconcepttrading_video_7328310041201708290.txt," What's up traders, Julian from Concept Trading. Wanna chat to you guys about economic trends in February? That can help us get a better read on the market. The way I see it, there are a lot of thematics going on, but the major ones seem quite persistent. So we've got disinflation. Looking for a rate cut in the second half of this calendar year, which would be great for all those homeowners. We've got the China Gross Story, Kebion Iron China obviously, they're one of the big growth engines that drive everything, we've just got a print from them. It was below a little below expectation, by 0.1% but above 5%, which is a good thing. We've got geo-political tensions, which I see as moderating, could flare up at any time, that will in itself provide an opportunity, but we're seeing it base in the world prices as a bit of a proxy for what's going on over there. So what this means is the market will be in a bit of a range. Outside of any major news, we'll start to sort of become to the current scenario we're in. Great for range traders. So a good range, I see at the moment, is in equity markets, the Aussie 200 is a good example. In the top of the range, this is mid-January. We want to look for opportunities where that starts to short and then we find a good direction and that hopefully will stay for a while because these branches are quite big. Data will dramatically change this, especially if it's outside of what animals are thinking. So February's quite busy. We've got three interest rate decisions in the first part of the month that is from the US Bank of England and the RBA. And they've got a raft of data starting pretty much straight away with the farm payrolls and then we go into Porta Reed's GDP, CPI, retail sales, those sorts of things that will really give some picture. Outback with looking units, it's a bit of a slow period, November to December January and so you want to keep that all in mind. Gotta be mentally prepared for the month ahead. Hopefully this has helped you out and you're ready to tackle all those situations. Gotta get them.",subjective

Um, I'm at my shop because I have to do some organizational work here, but I am not open today because I need mental health day. Um, yeah, I have been dealing with housing insecurity for over a year now. Um, I am staying at a land project. I'm going to not say the name of hit on here. Um, but, uh, I've been the sole caretaker there for almost a year and that is, um, that is 10 months longer than I was hoping to be there. So, um, uh, having a really hard time finding a place to live, um, with my sweet, beautiful pets who are my support system. Um, I, uh, have never really had like a long-term stable situation. Um, I left home early, um, to get away from some toxic shit in my childhood, my family. Um, and I've pretty much been in survival mode since then. And I'm fucking tired, you guys. I am exhausted. And before COVID, out here where, uh, is the little tiny small town, um, it was easy to find a place to live. I didn't have a problem before, but since COVID, um, I don't know that everybody went into like panic mode about properties and, um, like lots of out-of-state people came and bought up properties, um, or people are, they're sitting there on the market for sale and, um, people that bought properties want to charge like outrageous amounts for them now. Even though there's like no economy out here to support that. Um, so, uh, yeah, it's been about a year now that I have not been able to find my own place. Um, in the meantime, you know, any, any, like money I had, uh, to try to find a place, um, has just been bleeding out because the place that I'm caretaking, um, requires a lot of me. Um, you know, I'm, I'm supporting the animals that live there plus my own pets. So every morning before I even leave to go anywhere, it's like a lot of work. Um, there are multiple buildings and, um, I am not, I have not been able to, you know, maintain everything to a standard, you know, the board of directors and understands that I am only one person. So, um, it's just after a while, it becomes really overwhelming. So where I lived does not feel like comfortable or home like, um, so I, um, have this little shop here which makes me very happy. But, you know, as I said, it's a small town. So there's not a lot of traffic to support it, which is why I am on TikTok because someone suggested that I can, you know, get an audience here that will help me with my business. So that's what I've been up to. Almost in panic mode because I do need to come up with, uh, money to go find housing. So that's where I'm at today. Have an RF day. And I think that a lot of people are experiencing this housing insecurity situation right now in the world. So, um, yeah, I don't know. I'm not sure what to do about it or how to, uh, you know, pull myself up by my bootstraps as they say, which is such a shitty fucking saying. I hate that shit. I have never been a lazy person since I left home. I fucking worked and worked and worked and worked for like barely anything, worked to make other people successful and have no savings or anything to show over it. Um, nor have I ever been able to buy myself any property or anything like that. So, at this point, I'm not lazy. I'm fucking tired. I am exhausted.

Like, um, it might look better than wherever you're from, but we're fucking struggling with poverty and, um, the homelessness epidemic here in the United States is like really fucking gross and disgusting. It's getting crazy out of hand. And I mean, I was homeless when I first left home. I ran away from home and I lived on the streets for a few years. Um, that was a walk in the park to what people are dealing with now homeless people. Um, it's, it's crazy. And so, you know, it's like, am I there? Does that be next? Because I don't understand how we're supposed to, I don't know, I don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to do. So, anyway, this is me being really honest today. I am struggling.

@kaitalayna_video_7300724659438243115.txt," This is a great question, so let's go through why I chose $20,000 as my emergency fund goal. First off, I calculated what one month's expenses looked like for me, specifically for my needs and bills only. If I were to have an emergency pop-up, I wouldn't spend as freely as I do on my wants. My rent is about $1,150 per month. I estimated $300 for utilities. I do typically spend about $400 on groceries, but if I were to have an emergency pop-up, I would scale back to $300 per month. My car insurance is about $100 per month. I am estimating that I would spend $150 on gas per month. My phone bill is $100 per month, and my student loan debt minimum payment is about $350. I could scale back on my subscriptions if an emergency popped up, but if I were to get laid off, I do think I would want my hulu and Netflix subscriptions to pastime and be depressed for a little bit, so I would probably keep those at $250 per month. And then I'm also adding a $300 buffer for miscellaneous expenses that could pop up that I'm not necessarily thinking of right now. This brings my scaled back monthly expenses to about $3,000. The next step is choosing how long you want your emergency fund to last you. Common emergency fund lengths are three months, six months, nine months, and one year. And this just depends on your risk level. I went with six months because I have a pretty stable job. I do have a boyfriend, but we're not married, so I'm technically single with no dependence, which means I don't have a lot of financial responsibilities, and I do have two other jobs and sources of income. So now we'll take my $3,000 monthly expenses and multiply it by my six month emergency fund, and that gives us $18,000, which isn't a nice round number, so I'm going for $20,000 in my emergency fund. Let me know if you have any other emergency fund questions and follow me for more personal finance tips.",subjective
@christinakdub_video_7286656712533216554.txt," You know what? Not a lot of people are talking about right now. It's how closely tied our healthcare insurance is to our actual employment and employment status. Like it's actually disgusting how closely tied they are because if you don't have a good corporate job or a good company job, then you most likely won't have good insurance. And the cherry on top to all of this is that if you've been laid off either from a big tech company or a good company, they'll try and sell you on this co-brush it. And that health insurance might let you hang on to what you had at your original company before, but they'll charge you a thousand dollars a month as an individual to continue that coverage. Now if you decide to opt out of it, you get thrown into this amazing world of confusing information. So let this be known that if you're going through the unemployment process or if you know somebody going through that, healthcare is the next thing to worry about. Because once you don't have employment, you have to figure all of this out by yourself. At the end of the day, it's not the end of the world, but I'm just throwing it out there because we're not talking about it a whole lot yet. So food for thought and good luck!",subjective

But where are students enrolled after their school closes? Instead of getting the opportunity to enroll in a higher performing nearby public school, students are more often than not sent to a lower performing school that's further away from where they live. And what's primarily driving all this? A system that relies on exclusionary school boundaries. Those most impacted by this process are students of color and students from low-income families. Going through a school closure is painful enough. We shouldn't add to the pain of these students by denying them access to better educational opportunities just because of their address.",subjective

I think it's so important, especially as healthcare workers, that we stop stigmatizing addiction and mental health issues, and this exactly why I partnered with an amazing company that is near and dear to my heart called Lion Rock Recovery. Lion Rock is the leading telehealth provider for substance use disorder treatment and recovery in the US. It allows nursing professionals to have an accessible way to get help and get recovery in the comfort of their own homes. And schedules, we all know that nurses and healthcare professionals have these crazy schedules, which makes it really hard for them to get help if they need it. But Lion Rock Recovery knows that and has provided a personal track for nurses to get help. This is something I really needed years and years ago, so to know that it's available now, I want everyone to know about it. And also, if you want to know my personal journey into recovery, I did a podcast with one of the owners of Lion Rock. Her name is Ashley Low Blastin Game, and she has a podcast called Courage to Change. I am on it telling my story this Tuesday, November 21st. This is a really great opportunity for anyone struggling with mental health issues or addiction issues to reach out to Lion Rock Recovery for a free consultation. And if you mention me, Hospice Nurse Julie, you will get a free three-month trial of their LionRock.life recovery groups, which is basically access to a bunch of peer groups to help you get help. And as much as we all resist getting help in a group setting, I really do feel like we heal in community. You're not alone, you can get help, and you can get help today. Reach out to LionRock.

If you're a young person and you've experienced housing insecurity over the course of the pandemic, you're not alone. We've been left out of federal rental assistance programs where availability is already very limited with only one in four eligible households receiving any support. So it's clear that resources and support for us is even more deprooritized. Not having access to housing makes it possible for young people to focus on our futures, build community, and grow emotionally, physically, spiritually into the people that we want to become. It doesn't make sense that securing housing takes this much suffering. In order to address the youth housing crisis exacerbated by the pandemic, policymakers need to give us a seat at the table.

@chelseaspursuit_video_7288871303208029445.txt," A common misconception about emergency funds is that you only need $10,000 or $15,000. This is incorrect. Your emergency fund is completely custom to your financial situation. So a one month emergency fund should cover all of your needs and all of your debts if it's applicable. So the emergency fund would cover your rent, would cover all of your insurances, would cover your pets, would cover yourself to eat, throughout the month. That means groceries, not restaurants, but basically all of your necessities that you need in order to live. That is one month of an emergency fund and that completely varies from person to person. And how many months of an emergency fund should you have? Well, that also completely depends on your situation. If you're a full time, salary, employee, you don't own a home. Three months of an emergency fund should be more than enough. If you own your home, I would definitely say at least six months of an emergency fund. And if you're self-employed, I would say six to 12 months, ideally, of an emergency fund. Last but not least, make sure that you keep your emergency fund in a high yield savings account that's easily accessible if you ever need it. Don't invest this money. Keep it cash somewhere safe where you can get it anytime.",subjective
@clearpathnyc_video_7102156379435109675.txt," Hi everyone, welcome to ClarePath NYC and today we're telling you everything you need to know about hospital architecture. If you live in a big city or even if you live in a suburban area, you may notice an influx of spikes, of barriers, of leaning bars, or maybe even just more blocks on the street. Hospital architecture also known as defensive architecture or unpleasant architecture or exclusionary design is a design strategy that seeks to curb certain behaviors in public spaces. While it may seem harmless, this is a design that is used to physically make people uncomfortable to sit down. This is a leaning bar, it's something that you can only really rest your backside on and it prevents people from sitting down comfortably or from laying down on these benches. In England, this is a photo of a sanctioned bench, it's called because they are separated from one another. This is to prevent people from laying down, specifically targeting the poor and those experiencing houselessness. In China and under many underpasses of the United States, you will find spikes aligning them solely to keep people from sleeping under them during inclement weather. Going against everything that harm reduction seeks to improve is blue light bathrooms. This one can be found in Canada. This is a bathroom that is blue lit solely to prevent people from finding things that are in the correct position to use intravenous drugs. However, they increase the risk of infections and also increase uncleneliness in that bathroom because you really can't see anything. Critics of hostile architecture like Clear Path NYC, we agree that this is in humane and it solely targets teenagers, those that are suffering from housing instability, and those that don't have other places to congregate accept public spaces. The worst, probably most, egregious part about hostile architecture is just how it lacks self-awareness. This is a statue of a man sleeping on a bench occupying said bench so that other people cannot sleep on it. Now, when we identify hostile architecture, we want to identify it with these three questions. One, what behavior is being curved? Two, whose behavior is being curved? And three, who is directly benefiting from this curb in behavior? And the answer is usually follows something like it's sobbing people from laying down or congregating in large groups. It's directly targeting people who are homeless and children who are coming out from schools. And three, it's benefiting wealthy people who don't want to have to see something that they deem unsightly. And now that you can identify hostile architecture, please stitch this video or do edit and let us see hostile architecture in your neighborhood. And we're going to go through the cost of hostile architecture in our next video.",subjective

@quarterchart_video_7321107805711207712.txt," So follow this two trends to predict if the economy is going to melt down in 2024. First, the inflation data. Currently, the CPI is trending down. This is great. It means that prices are getting more stable and have stopped rising. However, the next CPI data is expected to be slightly up. We will see the CPI report next week. The second trend you need to look for is business growth. Data shows that businesses cannot raise their prices because consumers are not willing to pay more anymore. This is great from an inflation standpoint, but the thing is, businesses want to grow. If they can't raise their prices and can't increase the number of sales in the current economy, they will have to lower their costs, which usually means cutting jobs. This would be a really bad trend that could push the economy into a bad recession. As long as the inflation is low, the Fed will be able to lower interest rates to stimulate growth in the economy. But if inflation goes back up, the Fed will not be able to do that anymore. And if the growth goes down at the same time, we could be in a stagflation territory. This is why I'm looking at growth and inflation.",subjective

Being lonely and socially isolated is equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. That's really serious. So biological aging is the result of all of our stressors and our psychological stressors and relational stressors. Our lack of connection is really important. A lack of physical touch, lack of intimacy. There's a huge role, not lack of being understood and seen in witness. There's a huge role in so much of the ailments that we're suffering. We're not just mental on this, but also physical illness and our longevity. So this whole idea of socio-genomics, I actually came up with this term years ago when I was in Haiti and then it became part of medical literature, not because of me, because other people also started climbing onto it. And it was the idea that our social relationships and our social networks may be more important than our genetic connections in determining our health and our health outcomes. Our lifestyle certainly influences our genes, but so does our social connections, our relationships influence our gene expression. And it's really not an abstract theory or notion. It literally is biology. Our thoughts, our beliefs, our relationships all drive real changes that we can measure in our gene expression. That can control inflammation, stress hormones.

@maru.sarah_video_7296941370298699013.txt," As someone who goes to Japan every year, the one thing that I make sure to prepare is my internet access while I'm in Japan. Hi, I'm Sarah, I'm half Japanese, and I'm here to give you all these Japan travel tips. So free public wifi in Japan is not as common as you think, and even as somebody who goes to Japan every year, it can be difficult to navigate Japan without internet. When I go to Japan, I always buy a data simpl plan to have the most comfortable trip. I use apps like Google Maps and Navi Time while on the go because Tokyo's train network looks like this, and things can get complicated really quickly. It's also so easy to get lost in Japan's alleyways while you're walking. And if you're not confident with your Japanese, you'll definitely want reliable access to some translation apps so you can communicate with the locals more easily. Also, don't forget that Japan is prone to earthquakes and typhoons, so it's important to stay connected. I personally prefer data sims over pocket wifi's, so I don't have to worry about recharging it or returning the rental after the trip. If you're looking for a plan for your Japan trip, Texter's E-Sim Japan data plan is offering reliable access to their 4G and 5G networks with major Japanese network companies such as NTT Docomo and SoftBunk. E-Sim is a virtual SIM card instead of one that you insert into your phone and it comes with its advantages. No physical SIM card means no shipping costs and no anxiety about hoping your SIM card will come in time for your trip. Right now, Texter E-Sim is offering a huge sale on all their Japan data plans. And their 10 GB plan is on sale for only $18. And if you use my unique code, Sarah10, you'll get an additional $3 off making the plan only $15. You can find Texter E-Sim on their website below that I'll link in the description and you can also find them on their mobile apps. As usual, if you have any questions, you can leave them in the comments below and I hope you have a wonderful trip to Japan.",subjective

And I wanna be really careful as I venture into this territory. Let me start by acknowledging this. I do believe that mental illness is a very real thing. Let me start there, okay? So hear me on this. My undergrads and psychology, I've studied all this. I know at times chemicals can be off. I know at times brains can be broken. And so there are some people who need doctors and medicine. There are. I think for a lot of people though, that's not the problem. I think a lot of people today in our society are suffering mentally because they're not obeying God in their thinking. Can I tell you how God says to think? First off, He tells us in Romans 12, too, that we need to be transformed each and every day by the renewing of our mind. Here's where that happens. It happens by you bearing your face in the pages of this amazing book, God's Word to you so that you can know how to think rightly. Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10, 5, that you and I as believers in Christ should take every thought captive and make it obedient to Jesus Christ. And so here's how that works. Every thought that passes through your mind, you just wrestle it down to the ground and you ask the question, is this God honoring or is it not? Is this helpful for me or is it not? And if it is, you hold onto it. If it's not, you reject it, devil, get out of my mind and quit messing with me. You bring every thought under the Lordship of Jesus Christ.",subjective

These days, the divide is between people who are using technology to become almost super human. Think about someone who has mastered how to use a computer, who can connect to anyone in the world, can access any piece of knowledge they want, has taken dozens of online courses on any topic you can imagine, and the divide between that group and everyone else who doesn't have those advantages just gets wider and wider. The average person with a personal computer connected to the internet has resources, informational resources that the president of the United States did not have even just 20 or 30 years ago. And they're using those resources. They're using them to become even better, even faster, even richer.

And the SBA is too lending as the FDIC is too banking. So it's a guarantee source or banks, but you aren't gonna go to the SBA to get a loan. You're gonna go to your local bank and they're gonna approve your business loan subject to an SBA guarantee. If you default on the bank loan, the bank can go back to the SBA and recoup 75% of their original loan value. So it's very important for lenders to use. The terms of SBA typically are you're gonna put 15 to 20% down. It's going to be a 10 year term, prime plus 2% interest. So it's not cheap money, but it's usually necessary in small business ownership.

@ciscoflapjacks_video_7280749390447299883.txt," I just got off the phone with my mom. She is in a long-term care center, aka a nursing home because she has Alzheimer's, and she's been in there since mid-July. She doesn't realize that she has Alzheimer's. She doesn't think there's anything wrong with her, so she doesn't understand why she's there, and it's a big point of contention. I go over there about twice a week by myself and spend a good hour there with her. Spend time with her, just listening to her fucking vent about being there because she thinks she works there, so venting about her co-workers, aka the staff. In addition to that, I go pick up my dad who's still living at home by himself right now, and I take him over there, and we spend a good two hours there, and they hold hands the whole time. During those times that my dad is there is when I see her the most lucid. She knows who he is, who we are, they reminisce about things. She's calm, and she's pretty lucid. The rest of the time, she's off the fucking rails. She calls me every day, multiple times a day. I would say one-fourth of those calls, she's pretty calm, and she's kind of just checking in with me, you know, telling me, oh, I just got off work or whatever. Three-quarters of the time, she is freaked the fuck out, like screaming at me to call the police because she's being held hostage. She's telling me what a terrible shitty daughter I am for making this decision about her life and putting her in this place. Majority of the time, though, she is just freaking out about my dad, worried she thinks he's in the hospital, she thinks something's happened to him, she can't figure out how to get home, she doesn't know what happened to her car, and she's just worried about him. Whenever we speak, she makes it clear that she doesn't remember that we've ever been there. We are with her hours every week. I take pictures and video every time I'm there, just so that I can remember some of the things she says and have pictures and video of her with my dad, and she never has any recollection of it. She's like heartbroken, thinking that my dad and I have abandoned her there. I try so hard to be patient and loving with her always. I mean, having a kid with autism has kind of prepared me for this role, but I try to meet her where she is. She tells me she borrowed someone's car and drove up to the mountains. I'm like, oh, were the leaves turning yet? Did you see any wildlife on the way? She tells me she just got off work and she needs me to come get her and give her a ride home. I say, I can't come right now because, you know, I'm right in the middle of stuff with the kids, but if you hang out there and get a bite to eat in the restaurant and just chit chat with your coworkers, I can be there later. Within a few hours, she usually forgets that we even talked. It feels like all I do is gaslight the fuck out of her to try and like redirect, distract, and calm her down. And it only works for like a minute and then hours later, we're on the phone again and she doesn't even remember that we spoke. I don't know why this phone call hit me so hard. I was telling my mom, I can't come get you right now. I'm not coming to get her at all. So I can't come and get you right now. I'm pulled in a lot of direction and just like, yeah, that's all I hear from you. And I just started crying and I couldn't not stop crying. She was like, what's going on? Is there stuff going on with the kids? I have two sets of twins. They're close in age. They're 2018 and out of the four kids, three are off at college. So they've left home and then one is going to college and living at home, but he's having a hard time struggling right now with some things. And so between that and the fucking shit going on with my parents, it's a lot. And I just could not stop crying and her tone like immediately shifted. Like whatever's left of my mom, like she kicked it into mom mode for a second. And she just sounded like herself. She just was like, well, you need to just take it easy and take care of yourself a little bit. And I was just like, I miss you so much, mom. I just miss you. I just miss you and I miss dad. And she was like, well, I'm right here. Why don't you come get me? We'll go get a sandwich and we can just, you know, talk about some things. I'm there all the time. It doesn't matter. I could go over right now and spend hours with her. And she goes to bed tonight. She'll get up tomorrow and she will have no memory that I was ever there. And part of the difficulty is that she is so fucking hateful to me most of the time. And to everybody around her that I just dread going over there, I fucking dread it. But I'm not going to just abandon her there either. And I just don't know how to get through this when she has one foot in reality and one foot in Lalla land.

@livingwith.adhd_video_7277601576624180513.txt," So many people watch me cry about my mold, which is brilliant. It's just a clue if you think so. Number one is I'm not going to clean everything or piece of furniture that has mold on it. One because you can't properly kill mold whilst there's still a mold issue. Like even if I clean the mold it's going to come back anyway. So I don't want to disrupt the mold and put the mold spores in the air for me to breathe in and probably get sicker. I'm just going to leave it to fester until my landlord sorts out the issue. Number two is I open my windows every single day. I have my dehumidifier on all the time and I have those little shitty throwaway ones in like cubits, my wardrobe, my chest drawers. I have them in the moldiest parts of my living environment. It's still molding. Number three is I live in a terraced house that's converted into flats and I live on the ground floor. It's old-ish terraced house. I resort the terraced houses have naturally higher humidity because they lack insulation. I have a bay window, absolutely no insulation. All of the walls to my house are just brick. Like there's no insulation anywhere. The walls inside my house they're just like corrugated car like they're fucking hollow. So I resort they had an actual higher humidity anyway. Also for the people telling me to put my heating on for one it's 24 degrees in my flat. Two, when I put my heating on in the winter it doesn't hold heat. My lounge normally sits about nine degrees. It drops down to about nine degrees overnight. When I put my heating on it doesn't get the boyteen and then as soon as my heating's off within half an hour an hour it's dropped back down to about 12. So the people telling me to put my heating on and leave it on. One, I'm on a pre-payment meet and that will cost me literally all my wages and more. Two, my flat doesn't hold heat at all because there's clearly no fucking insulation so it's kind of redundant for me to do it and for the rate as soon as the heat ends off the humidity goes straight back up. So for those of you who tell me to put my heating on because that'll get rid of the mold. For starters it is still 24 degrees in my flat even over the humidity is like 80% at the minute but even when I have my heating on the humidity still stays at like 65% of the percent. It never drops down. I've never had my humidity go below 60% like never. Even with my heating on, never.",subjective

@allyssaablon01_video_7221369148910193921.txt," Someone's jumped over in the night and put salt all over the land. So if you don't know a very similar thing happened in St. Lucia and Brisbane, except it was done by the government. A collection of local gardeners built this beautiful garden because during this cost of living crisis, there are lots of people who are starving. And these people volunteered their own time and money into building this garden so that other people could get food for free. But the biggest problem was that they'd asked for approval from the wrong people. Not the council, but local Aboriginal elders, the traditional owners of the land. And they had door knocked throughout the community, families were excited about the prospect of this garden. There were local families with children who were excited to plant seedlings and watch vegetables grow. But then what happened was that a select few wealthy people in the area who took it upon themselves to speak for the rest of the community said that they did not want this garden. So they called the cops, called the council, and the government, our government, wasted taxpayer dollars to go out of their way to destroy this garden that was there to provide free food to poor people. They bulldozed it. And it really highlights how hollow and empty it is every time colonises acknowledge the traditional owners of this land. Like all the time, we pay our respects to elders past and present. Yeah, well, the elders of this land, this land for tens of thousands of years, they said we are happy for the community to plant a garden here, to feed people. But the council said no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We can't possibly have that. And this councilman was trying to convince people oh, there's no need for this free garden because we have community gardens 500 metres away. But failed to highlight that the community garden that is council approved, you have to pay for a membership. You have to pay for a membership. Your membership has to be approved by the committee, the committee of the community garden, and they're allowed to stop letting you use it if you don't contribute enough. And that's after you've paid your membership. Bro, that's not a community garden, that's just a really shit outdoor store. These were some comments on his post by local constituents, who were also upset that the garden got taken down. If you don't know, St. Lucia is the suburb where the University of Queensland is, so there are a lot of poor uni students who live in that area. University students who are currently starving, while taxpayer dollars are spent on bulldozing a garden that was supposed to provide free food to the community. When destructive decisions like this are being made by people who are old enough, that they definitely got to go to university for free. I don't know if we're still making Hunger Games content, but if you don't remember, the only reason why Katniss knew how to hunt how to use a bow and arrow is because her and Gail were illegally poaching food in the wilderness, which was illegal, because the legal thing to do was to starve in silence. These teenagers broke the law daily in order to feed their families. And the one time Gail got caught, this happened. And like we can all see that that's wrong, right? Like in the movie and the books you can see that that's wrong. But we're supposed to believe that it was good for the council to tear down this garden because they didn't get the legal council approval to feed starving people.",subjective

@nixonbcmortgage_video_7336315085234687238.txt," This video is on inflation in the US and in Canada. The market believes that we're going to slide glide right into the 2% target. And the reason they believe this is because Jerome Powell came out and said he's going to be serving up three interest rate cuts this year. If we're going to see all these interest rate cuts, then the market definitely believes that we're going to reach that 2% magical number. I want people to understand how inflation is calculated. They use a year over year comparison. So if inflation went bananas last year, it's much easier to show a lower inflation amount this year. The problem is the inflation numbers are starting to bottom out and forming a bottom. They're no longer disinflationary. The issue is if you look at the CPI for the month of January, it rose 0.4%. If we annualize that, that's 5% core inflation. 5% inflation is nearly doubled the 2% inflation target. So they should not be talking about interest rate cuts and how many they're going to be doing. They should be talking about how many interest rate increases they're going to be doing this year. More proof that they need to be talking about interest rate hikes is that the household debt in the United States has now surpassed 17.5 trillion dollars. And credit card debt is now at all time record high of 1.5 trillion dollars. What's even more significant is that while we have record high credit card debt, we also have record high interest rates on that debt. So when you have record high debt and record high interest rates on that debt, that's a massive burden to borrowers. Higher interest rates are supposed to do two things. First, the borrowers are boring less because they cost more to borrow and two, they're saving more money because they get more of a return in their saving account. What we're seeing right now is these higher interest rates from 0 to 5% have not done anything to cut back on borrowers spending. So the higher interest rates are not getting the desired outcome. Meaning these interest rates are definitely not high enough. The problem is they can't increase interest rates any further because the consumer cannot afford it. The government can't afford it and the economy cannot afford it. The problem is the government and the Federal Reserve have spent the last two decades getting people hooked on cheap credit. This is like getting people hooked on drugs. After you remove the drugs, you can't expect them to act the same. They're going to definitely have a hangover. Jerome Powell noticed that people are starting to have a hangover and that's when he stopped talking about interest rate heights and he pivoted to interest rate cuts. They're trying to prop up the economy and stop it from collapsing. This is an election year. But the fact that the consumer continues to spend means that there's going to be continued upward pressure on prices. The problem is the consumer is not boring record amounts of money at record high interest rates because they have a choice. They're boring because they have absolutely no choice. They're not boring the money to buy fancy cars or large ticket items. They're boring the money to fill up their tank of gas and to pay for food to feed their families. They're going to the store to buy food and they are also picking up two or three jobs just to survive right now. The problem does not stop at the consumer. The Federal government is spending money like crazy. They just passed a $95 billion aid package to be sent overseas. They don't even have that money to spend. They're either going to have to print it or they're going to have to borrow that money. The US Federal budget has now exceeded $34 trillion. The government continues to borrow money when these high interest rates should have the same effect as it has on the consumer where they actually start cutting back on spending and increase taxes. Titer monetary policy is supposed to create tighter fiscal policy. All of this government spending is definitely stoking inflation. So what does all these higher inflation numbers mean for the market? Well the market thinks that oh well you know what we're just going to get rate cuts later on this year and all the rate cuts that were supposed to happen this year are now going to take place in 2025. At most what they could do is just pause long term and not do anything but they could definitely not increase interest rates because the market has already priced in six interest rate cuts meaning if they start increasing interest rates it would implode the market. So once inflation starts heading back up the Fed can't change their stance and even if they did change their stance the market would not believe them. The market believes that we're going to get to the 2% target and that we're going to have that soft landing that they've been selling us. They are convinced that we are in a magical fairy tale and we're going directly where we need to go. I personally believe that the US is already in a recession that I don't believe any of the economic data that they keep pumping out. We see all over the place major companies laying off tens of thousands of people regularly. People are going to think that this is great news that there's a bunch of layoffs and the economy is going into recession but the problem is it is not great news because if the economy goes into recession or already in recession the US Federal Reserve is going to have to do QE and pump trillions of dollars into the economy and that is definitely going to cause a ton of inflation. They're already running trillions of dollars in deficits every single quarter. Think about this. This is what's really sad is the higher interest rates did not stop borrowing at all. It didn't stop borrowing for the consumer. It did not stop borrowing from the government. It has resulted in something else more inflation because the cost of borrow money is inflationary. If it costs it's like anything else. If you are borrowing money and it's costing you more that is inflationary. Businesses will need to pass on those extra interest rate costs to their customers and what sucks is the businesses don't want to pass on these costs to you and I the problem is if they don't they're going to be out of business. See all of this could have been avoided. It's not the consumer. The consumer needs to spend money to eat and shelter themselves but if governments were more fiscally responsible and they started actually making tough decisions and start cutting we would actually not be in this mess right now. The problem is in the US there's an election every four years and they will do absolutely anything to be reelected even if it destroys you and I the consumer and the people and in Canada we rely heavily on the United States and we can't do anything about it. If they start cutting interest rates we're going to start cutting interest rates and guess what if inflation is still a problem we're going to have a repeat of the 1980s. It's looking more and more like the likely scenario is called stagflation where we have a weak economy and we have rapid inflation. That is something that we definitely need to pay attention to and that's why I have created my channel so that I can inform everybody on where we're at.

We need to work out a solution, for example, for real estate, where I know when there's regulation, then there's no incentive to remodel.

These trends impact our daily lives and here's just two examples. First is health care. With private equity firms buying up medical practices, their $150 billion investment in 2021 means changes to how you access health care, often leading to fewer staff and longer wait times for appointments if you can even get one. Second is housing. In cities like Nashville and Phoenix, large investment firms bought up blocks of single-family homes contributing to the skyrocketing house prices and rents. This trend affects not just home buyers but renters too altering the landscape of the real estate markets.

@thetiredscientist_video_7268642065179790597.txt," I am annoyed as hell, but we're gonna use this as a learning moment. So environmental health is a pretty nuanced area. There's the obvious bit where it's how does the natural environment affect your health? Like with the water fires happening literally everywhere right now. So many that I don't even know how to make videos about them because there are so many. Environmental health is also what are the things in your environment that impact your health? So let's do an example. I live in an apartment building. My neighbor's smoke. My neighbor's smoke on the back balcony. And the cigarette smoke comes in to my apartment. Now ignoring the fact that I'm an asthmatic and so it triggers me acutely. This would be an environmental health factor for anybody because secondary smoke is a lung cancer risk. And you can cause all sorts of health problems with your lungs. That is something in your environment outside of your control that is going to impact your health. This can also look like if you live somewhere with more damage or really bad air circulation. Or if you live in an area with high amounts of air pollution. All of these things from the environment impact. A lot of environmental health impacts have to be addressed at a policy level. Different stages could be local, could be federal, it doesn't matter. So as a using my neighbors as a case study, if we wanted to address the smoke coming into my apartment. We could say either the apartment complex could say, hey, no smoking on your back balcony. They already say don't smoke by the front door, but they could also say don't smoke on the back balcony and make a designated smoking area across the parking lot. But they don't do that at a local level or a federal level. There could be a policy saying that you are not allowed to smoke within so many feet of a residential, like a communal residential area. So that would look like dorms, that would look like apartments, that would look like living like long term care facilities. That you're not allowed to smoke within a certain number of meters of feet of a opening. So windows or doors on an individual level though. These are things that are very outside of people's control. I can only do so much to stop my neighbor from smoking, but our healthcare system is focused around individual behavioral modes of change for health. So it the individual like the behavioral model of healthcare. And so it assumes that if my asthma is getting worse, it's my fault. And really my neighbors are just assholes.",subjective
@a_voice_4_compassion_video_7212721964559912238.txt," The economic trends for men have turned downwards along four dimensions. One is wages, most men today earn less than most men did in 1979. An employment with a drop in labor force participation of 8 percentage points, which means 9 million men now, of prime age are not working. We've seen a drop in occupational stature and so there are now more men working in employment areas which are seen as lower status in the past. And we've also seen a drop in the acquisition of skills, the kinds of skills in education that boys and men need. If boys don't get educated and men don't get skilled, they will struggle in the labour market and across all of those domains we've seen a downward turn for men in the last four or five decades. And so the way in which social class divides have opened up, economic inequality has widened. It's really important to understand in the context of gender inequality. If we only focus on gender gams, then we miss the fact that both men and women at the top have done increasingly well, but that's much less true of everybody else and especially it's less true of those from lower income backgrounds, working class boys and men and black boys and men. You see many of those trends are amplified and so those boys and men are really at the sharpest end of many of the social and economic changes. On the one hand we have a huge and successful and laudable effort to get more women into STEM jobs, so science, technology, engineering and math. On the other side we have what I call heel jobs. That's health, education, administration and literacy, almost if you like the opposite side of the coin to STEM jobs. And that's where a lot of the jobs are coming from, health and education alone are huge growing sectors in the US and so by my estimates for every one job we're going to create in STEM between now and 2030, we're going to create three in heel jobs. But those jobs are at least as gender segregated as STEM jobs, but in the other direction. And unlike STEM becoming more so over time, so if you look at the heel sector, only 24% of the workers in those sectors are male and that number is falling. And in particular sectors we're seeing a really precipitous drop in the number of men. We have a drop in the number of male teachers. We have a very sharp drop in the number of male psychologists that's dropped from 39% male to 29% male in the last decade alone. And among psychologists under the age of 30, only 5% are male. So we roll that forward and we're going to see psychology becoming essentially almost an all-female profession. So these jobs which are both crucial I think for society and where it'd be very useful to have more diversity are actually becoming more gender segregated and so we have absolutely no effort to get more men into heel jobs, which is where I think the future lies and where we should be helping men to move. One of the problems that we face is what I call in the book a dad deficit.",subjective

Let's start with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Under the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act the consumer has the right to dispute the debt. You dispute the debt by sending the debt collector a letter. In short the letter says hey buddy you're saying I owe you a hundred bucks? I don't believe I do. You need to provide me evidence that I owe you this debt. Once they receive that letter they have 30 days to provide you with proof that you owe them a debt. During this period they must cease any and all collection activity. They can't call you they can't email you they can't contact your employer they can't put a levier lean against you they can't report negative on your credit report.

@watchfulcoyote_video_7229422895800372522.txt," I understand that most people are perfect all their lives, and this video is not for them. So if you're perfect, feel free to keep scrolling. Okay, now that it's just those of us emotionally mature enough to recognize that literally everyone causes harm, let's talk about it. I'm really glad that some of you all have resonated with my videos, and I need you to know that what I share doesn't just come from books, it comes from hard earned, expensive wisdom. So if you've ever hurt someone, I think this video is worth the nine minutes. When we recognize that we've caused harm, we often feel shame. The name is a big word in English, it tries to encapsulate two opposite meanings. The first meaning is self-hatred. This is a growth prohibiting stagnating emotion. It's selfish and harmful and allows us to continue causing harm because we're identifying with being harmful. I cause harm so I am a harmful person. The second meaning of the word shame is learning. As in, oh, I'm ashamed of myself for not realizing that my mother-in-law was doing dishes while I sat on the couch like an elf, so I'm going to pay more attention and get up next time. In the second case, I'm not identifying with the behavior I'm ashamed of. I'm learning from its effects. It's easy to see that with a small example. It gets much trickier when the harm you've caused is more serious. And here's the thing, guys. In 15 years of menswear and men's groups, I've never yet met a man who has not caused serious harm to women in his life. As in, on the spectrum of sexual assault, domestic abuse, serious harm. Our expressions of these patterns vary greatly and that matters, but we all carry these patterns and we've all acted on them. The difference is that some men have had the support and or courage to face our inherited patterns of dehumanizing women. And most men think that, ah, that girl screamed at me or ran out crying that one time because she was crazy. Spoiler alert, bro, it wasn't her. You can spot these guys in my comments because they're the ones who feel the need to go type, I've never heard a woman or you're the problem. That pressure that drives men to say that is the fear of facing the possibility that they have. This is what modern male cowardice looks like. If you were actually the only man in the history of Western civilization who's never harmed a woman in any way, you wouldn't feel the need to say it because you'd be able to see how the trend I'm speaking to is accurate regardless of your exceptionality. Every single man in our culture was taught to dehumanize women until you face that potential in your own history in life, you're unsafe to everyone close to you. The shame that comes up for men when we face the fact that we've caused serious harm is literally lethal. I know. It drove a decade of suicidal addiction for me when I faced the fact that I had unknowingly done seriously harmful things. This isn't hyperbole. I spent years thinking the world would be better off if I were dead, like fucked up on drugs with the barrel of my gun in my mouth. I know what that self hatred for having caused harm feels like. I had the mixed blessing of some degree of community support in my awareness. I had close male friends who lovingly helped me see some of the impacts I was having on my partners. I had X's who told me how I'd hurt them, not everyone is so lucky. Because I live in the same tiny rural community I grew up in, and because I've led a very public-facing life even before TikTok, there are a lot of people around me who know my patterns of harm from 15 or 20 years ago. There's a lot of people who've never met me, but heard about my patterns and hate me for it. If you're a man, there are almost certainly people who hate you too, whether you know it or not. And this is what I want to talk about. Knowing that you've hurt people and knowing that there are people who hate you for it asks a great, great deal of you as a human being. It asks us to evaluate what our values are, what we were taught that led us to behave in ways that violated those values, how that led us to detach or dissociate from our essential unwound itself, and how can we build healthier identities that lead us into closer integrity with our values? It's work of deconstructing our inherited self and constructing or recovering who we want to be. I believe that the reason Shane leads us to feel suicidal is because there are parts of us that we can feel are out of integrity, parts of us that need to die, and we can let those parts of ourselves die and become healthier without them. Everyone in our lives is impacted by sexual assault and domestic abuse, and those things rightfully bring up very strong emotions. They've also been in the dark for far too long, and me too movement has been necessary medicine, been a long time coming, and all this pent up emotion about this makes us men feel even more terrified of having caused harm anywhere on that spectrum, and feel even more shame when we face the fact that we have. It also brings us to the other edge of the double edged sort of community support. Some of the same people who supported me in seeing my patterns of harm against women in my life 15 years ago have never been able to see my growth since then. Their identity in our friendship became about the harm that I'd caused. This is well intentioned, right? They're trying to enact community support, but that didn't make it any less harmful for me. As I grew, their relationships with me weren't just informed by the knowledge as I'm in my past, but were entirely defined by it. Their identities as allies in this way became restrictive for me. I'm a decade clean and sober, happily married to the only woman I've been with in many years. I've publicly acknowledged the ways I've been harmful, apologized, repeatedly offered community process, anyone who felt harmed by me. Some people took me up on those processes, some didn't, which is obviously fine, but none of that matters to some people who know my patterns in 15 or 20 years ago. Their identities are now built on me being a perpetrator, a monster threat. These are well intentioned people, some of whom would say they love me very much, and some of whom would say they fucking hate me, but for all of them, my growth threatens their sense of self. I deeply understand this because I was this way. I started trying to do accountability work with men in my community long before I was aware of my own harmful patterns, and I dehumanized and isolated those men. I harmed them and drove them away from support and relationship with me. My identity as an ally or as someone on the right team locked them into an image for me that I couldn't let them grow past, so they stopped engaging with me. In the same way, I've had to cut people I considered friends out of my life because their identities were built on an image of me that was no longer realistic if it ever was, and I wish I'd been able to see clearly enough to do it sooner. I know that my circumstances are a little extreme, but I believe this pertains to everyone who's caused harm, and here's my suggestion. Don't try and stay in relationship with anyone whose image of you locks you into patterns that you've actually healed from. All that will do is slow you down and make self love and continue to healing harder for you. This is true for people who hate you and true for people who love you. If you've caused harm in ways that are known, it's very, very likely that you've also been harmed by well-intentioned people trying to make the world a safer place. We are all raised in a culture that teaches us that the appropriate response to harm is more harm. It's called punishment for consequences, but it's just a perpetration of the cycles of harm that it's trying to heal. In order to grow, you will need to not only face the harms that you've caused, but also forgive the people who well-intentionally tried to help their community and harmed you in their efforts. This is incredibly hard work. The irony and self-defeating nature of it can tear you apart and make you better. Again, ask me how I know as a man who's out as having caused harm and working on it, people in my community often come to me about other people causing harm. And some of those people causing harm passionately hate me for the harm I caused and are quite public about that. The irony of knowing the patterns of violent harm being perpetrated by people who hate you for your old patterns of harm is a bitter pill to regularly swallow. It's made me reflect a lot on how I tried to practice accountability before I knew my own patterns. But forgiving those people continuously, as they're harming me, my family and my community with their righteous hatred, has been some of the most intensely liberating work I've ever done, far more liberating, grounding, peaceful, relaxing than the heavy work of facing the harm that I caused. So that forgiveness is not for their sake. It's for mind. It sets me up to create and live in the world that I want to live in. If you want to heal the cycles that led you to cause harm, you have to heal it all the way through just being less harmful, but remaining bitter and angry about it doesn't actually help. It's a way to cause harm in other ways. Some people I harmed have forgiven me and I hope that some day those who haven't forgiven me can as well. Not for my sake for theirs, so they can also grow and heal and together we can make a safer community and stop the cycle of just passing trauma back and forth. Despite that hope, know that there will be people for whom it will never matter what you do. Your healing is irrelevant to them because of the harm you caused, whether real or exaggerated, it's now foundational to their sense of themselves as an ally or a safe person or one of the good men or a feminist or whatever. Learn to spot that early on. Courageously take their feedback, let it inform your awareness of your own patterns of harm and if they can't grow with you, let them go. Whoever they are, sure make a good faith effort to help them grow the same way they did with you, but if they can't see it, if all they can hear in your efforts to help them grow is the idea that you need more validation for your growth or something else that isn't the point that all let them go. It would take an incredible, herculean, the amount of work for those people to see you now because it would require a shift in how they think of themselves. Not only that, if they're part of a community whose identity is contingent on you being harmful, then for any one of them to acknowledge your growth would risk them being demonized and ostracized as not an ally, they no longer be in the in-group of the good guys. You can't do that work for them individually or collectively, all you can do is heal yourself. If your sense of healing or growth remains hung up on what a single person or group of people think of you, you're limiting your own growth. My therapist explained to me how if we have codependent history, we can actually heal in our current relationships, but remain in functionally codependent relationships with people from our past, especially people who hurt us or who we hurt. Don't let those outdated codependent needs for validation define your growth. You are free to heal and grow regardless of what anyone else thinks of you. If you want to think about protecting your family, consider this. If you remain in community with people whose identities are based on an outdated harmful idea of you, then anyone you date, your children or your future children, can only exist in those communities in the shadow of the past that you've worked so hard to heal from. Again, I'm not saying to cut off anyone who knows your harmful history, the people I'm closest to in my life know my history the best. I'm saying that if someone's concept of you cannot keep up with who you've worked so hard to become, then consider carefully how much access to your family and you they get, because their projections of your past for the maintenance of their identity are going to cause harm, so it might be a chance to practice a hard boundary. This is the next layer of community growth that we must face if we want to heal the cycles of harm. If your efforts at community growth or accountability or safety are chaining, your friends or community members to the worst expressions of their historical wounds long after they've healed those patterns, then you are planning an active role in perpetuating cycles of harm by rebranding those harmful cycles as support or healing. We all instinctively want to distance ourselves from those cycles, and the primary way that expresses is in pretending that this is an individual problem. If we catch this one man, we've done it. This mindset makes it harder to see that it's not one man, it's all men, including you or the man sitting next to you. When we accept the public dehumanization of people branded as harmful, we become complicit in the ongoing colonial violence of dehumanization, excusing harm, which perpetuates the cycle. We're a collective species. Ostracization feels like death because it literally is. We're all carrying harmful patterns every one of us, and fear has never stopped a single crime, which is why the entire US penal system is statistically just a factory from making more criminals, and until we liberate our efforts at both community and individual healing from the carceral punitive mindsets we all inherit, we're not actually healing the cycles at all. Me too is necessary to drag these issues into the daylight, but it's not the end. Now we need to do the hard, dirty, painful work of figuring out how to actually support everyone's growth and the healing of masculinity.",subjective
@healwithbritt_video_7024294971024887046.txt," Here are seven signs that you may be experiencing chronic loneliness. First, what is chronic loneliness? Well, chronic loneliness can be described as the constant separation from others and the world, or the inability to connect with people in a deeper way. In a time when we are literally more connected than ever, via social media and technology and the like, we are actually lonelier and more isolated than we've ever been. According to the CDC, we are in a loneliness epidemic and this started even before the pandemic. Rates of loneliness in the United States have doubled in the past 50 years. Over 50% of Americans feel isolated or alone. Gen Z has been deemed by the CDC as the loneliest generation ever in the history of our country, and over 68% of Gen Z feels like no one knows the real them. So here are some quick signs that you may be experiencing chronic loneliness. Number one, oversharing or over explaining when there's finally someone there to listen. Number two, putting other people's needs or wants before your own. Number three, avoiding conflict, confrontation, or sharing how you really feel. Number four, feeling like you don't truly belong or the odd man out. Number five, not being able to express your boundaries to others. Number six, becoming obsessive or codependent with your friendships. And number seven, being a constant helper, fixer, or people pleaser. Are you experiencing chronic loneliness?

I know how much you love them, but I have good reason if contaminated raw oysters can carry a pathogen Belonning to the vibrio genus and cause an illness called vibrioosis Vibrioosis can cause symptoms like abdominal cramping Watery diarrhea vomiting fever chills. That's what I think now I personally preferred grilled oysters anyway. They have better flavor and I don't like the texture and it's just not worth the risk to me Number two is candied apples. I don't know if you say something so I'm not trying to be a hater. I love a good fall themed treat, but let me explain why There is a pathogen called Listeria monosatology is that is naturally occurring in the soil and there's many points of Contamination during the harvesting process of apples where the apples can be contaminated with this Now the reason why Listeria can be a problem with candied apples specifically is that there's obviously a spear here It's a spear that punctures and pushes that bacteria on the outside of the apple inside the juicy sugary center now pushed into the sugary center the Listeria now has food and it grows and grows and grows replicates You eat it and it makes you sick When ingested by pregnant women it could cause a phenomenon called spontaneous abortion not good Yeah, so I avoid it plus it's overrated anyway number three keenwa I didn't really want to say anything here.

@npr_video_7268726001343991086.txt," There's a new field of research that could allow same sex and trans couples to have babies that are biologically related to both parents. It's called in vitro game to genesis, or IVG. Basically, the technology would let scientists take any cell from a person's body and turn it into a sperm or an egg. So maybe you take the DNA from someone's skin and with the magic of science, boom, sperm or egg. It's a little more complicated than that, but that's the general idea. And IVG could help anyone struggling with fertility issues, like a woman who lost her eggs due to cancer treatment could have new eggs produced, or a man with a low sperm count could have other cells from his body turned into more sperm. But critics are worried that people could use his technology in a bad or weird way. Like could you take the DNA from a deceased spouse and have their baby? Or what if you stole DNA from a celebrity and used it to make a baby without their permission? Or what if you made a baby using only your own DNA? You know there's some rich Meglemaniacs out there.

@zachdoeswhatever_video_7314163510123056426.txt," Thank you for your comment. I'm not a professor, so if I say I'm not disagreeing with you, I just have questions. You got questions, and I think I might have some answers. Not to all of your questions, but to some of them. Like, for instance, why can an ACS worker break into your home and then the police officer says it's a jurisdictional issue? That makes no sense to me. I don't understand how that possibly works in the law. I'd have to look it up, but my gut instinct is telling me that that police officer was just lazy and didn't actually understand the law. They're not trained in the law. Anyways, that aside. One question I do think that I can answer is, why are they asking super specific things like what appliances you use and what's your home security? And how does that relate to things like infrastructure? Well, my answer is it relates to a lot more than just infrastructure. Infrastructure is definitely part of it. Appliances really help to figure out energy usage, things like that, where that energy usage is coming from, and how we might need to upgrade the power grid in certain areas. So that's important there. But things like what home security system are you using? That might feel a little more intrusive. And that actually has more to do with trying to get at people's attitudes and understandings. So a way of actually seeing that data in reports used is when we see an increase in the number of people who have home security systems, especially in certain areas, things like that, we can better understand people's sense of safety. It tells us more about their trust of the general public, which can help us understand where people's ideas might be coming from, or how people might be feeling, and how we need to address different priorities, so that people feel safe and comfortable. This is all to say that, yeah, there's a lot of really, really specific questions in those surveys. That data is so important for people like me who are using that for policy advocacy. A lot of times people don't trust things without data behind it, especially politicians. So it really helps when we're able to come at them and be like, hey, actually here's verified research. Now for what seems to be your more pressing question, which is why you and why not your neighbor that is willing to take the survey? Well, the best answer I can give you is probably survey methodology. So survey methodology, very complicated art form in and of itself. We have a lot of gold standards, but we rarely ever meet those standards because financial costs, issues of people not wanting to take surveys, things like that. However, when we are dealing with the ACS, which is the government's main source of data and arguably one of the most reliable data sets that's available to public policy researchers, they really, really want that to be accurate. There's a reason there's always a big push for the census. And this is basically just census light that fills in the gaps between those 10 years. So we need to be accurate. And while, yes, you not taking the survey and your neighbor taking it, wouldn't skew results that much. When we scale that up to the entire nation, now we might have some issues. We're going to start to get a selection bias where folks who want to take surveys are more likely to fill out the survey, and therefore the data is going to skew towards folks who like to take surveys, which might sound dumb. And it kind of is. But in reality, that little skew of people who like to take surveys, we don't know the ripple effects of that. And chances are it would probably skew more educated. It would probably skew richer. And that's just some of my guesses, based on what I know about trust of government and government surveys. Now, this is not to say that I agree with the practices of the ACS or that I really think that the privacy and safety of citizens should come second to data validity. I think that it is very, very important to try our best to start with that random sample. But I also don't think that that is good justification for absolutely harassing random Americans. In my head, it would make more sense to ask a person three times, make that push best you can to get that top quality data. But if they say no, go back to your random selection methodology and randomly select somebody else. And yes, that still has a potential to skew towards people who like taking surveys more. And yes, that can mess up our data a little bit. But we got to find a better trade off than breaking into people's homes. And ACS workers, it's not your home. Stay out of it. Don't go in. Leave people alone. That's weird.",subjective

And to do that we can create community support teams. Step 1. Reaching out. It's always great to help a person living on the street with a couple of bucks if you can afford it. But, if you can help them find and navigate resources, that might actually be what they really need. And a great way to find out is to talk to them. It might be a bottle of water or a sandwich or possibly something a little bit more involved like finding a place to stay. Step 2. Locate resources and connections. Reach out to medical clinics, mental health resources or food banks, and collaborate with folks that understand social systems like welfare. These systems might not be anarchistic, but learning how to navigate them will help you help others. Getting to know reliable and trustworthy people within those industries will help your entire team get resources that you need. Step 3. Plan operations. Will this team walk on foot throughout the neighborhood or is there a community center you can use? Will you be going out at night or working in high risk areas? You got a plan to be safe. Perhaps using community donations or crowdfunding to get things like yellow vests, bottles of water, and first aid kit. Step 4. Train, learn, and set goals. To go to harm reduction orgs, learn how to deal with mental health crisis and learn first aid. Learn how to administer Narcan, understand local laws and human rights.

@backwardshatbarrister_video_7358925835052584234.txt," For those of you applying for disability benefits, we have exciting breaking news today from the Social Security Administration that is especially going to be impactful for those of you who are applying for disability benefits who are over the age of 50. Social Security today announced that they are going to be publishing a final rule tomorrow in the Federal Register changing the definition of past relevant work in disability adjudication. Now up until now past relevant work was defined by social security as work that was performed generally on a full-time basis but earning at least what they call substantial gainful activity. That amount changes every year but this year it's $1550. They would look at your past work in the past 15 years. Today however, Social Security announced their intention to change the look back period to only being five years. But why is this so significant for those of you who are over the age of 50 in applying for disability benefits? As we've talked about in my videos in the past, when somebody is over the age of 50 you don't have to prove that there's no work at all that you can do. You have to prove that you can't do your past relevant work and that you can't do more than sedentary work. Similarly when you're over the age of 55 you don't have to prove that there's no work at all that you can do. You can't prove that you can't do your past relevant work and work which is it more than the light level of exertion. What that created in the past was a scenario where social security could deny people over the age of 50 and 55 saying that they could go back to maybe less physically demanding work that they did 10, 12, up to 15 years ago. With the change in the law however, now they're not going to be able to do that. They're only going to be looking at the last five years of your work history. This is going to make a huge difference for millions of people applying for disability benefits. Now I don't want you to think that this is only going to make a difference for people who are over the age of 50. It's also going to make a less cumbersome application for people who are under the age of 50 because even if you were only 38 when applying for social security, social security still sends you paperwork asking you to describe the work you've done in the past 15 years. Now it's going to be less work to do is you only have to describe the last five years of your work history. Although the rule is going to be published in the federal register tomorrow, this is going to go into effect beginning on June 8th of 2024.

@eyebvee_video_7346751084871847210.txt," So here are three things everyone needs to know about emergency funds. First of all, having only a thousand dollars in your savings account is not an emergency fund. Now, getting to this amount is a good goal, especially if you're starting from nothing, and it can definitely come in handy for those smaller, unexpected expenses that pop up. But a true emergency fund should contain enough cash to help you get through significant life events, such as a job loss or illness. So whereas a thousand dollars is a great rainy day fund, an emergency fund should have about three to six months of living expenses. And for anyone who doesn't know, a rainy day fund and an emergency fund are not the same. Also, a regular savings account is not the best place for your emergency fund, although it is a good place for your rainy day fund. Regular savings accounts have lower rates, meaning that your money is not going to grow much over time. So the best place for your emergency fund is a high yield savings account. And lastly, emergency funds should only be for true emergencies. And I don't know who needs to hear this, but going on a vacation or buying a new purse, those are not emergencies. Descriptionary spending, down payment funds, vacation funds, or any planned non-emergency expense that you have coming up is smart to have separate sinking funds accounts for these.",subjective

My name is Sam Sparks, I'm a consumer protection attorney, so I have quite a few clients who have been scammed by time shares. These contracts are usually super predatory. They can lock you in for life. They can technically make you have a mortgage that you didn't know you were signing up for. It's crazy. And if you don't pay all of their fees, they can really hurt your credit. Depending on where you sign the contract, they can be pretty hard to get out of, but there are ways.

More than 100 schools in England with buildings containing a potentially dangerous type of concrete have been told they must immediately shut them. Less safety measures are put in place just days before you go to school. You've probably been picking up a new pencil case or some smart, chic new shoes. But what used to be if your school falls down? The buildings in question are those with reinforced, autoclaved, aerated concrete. Or RAAC for sure. Chappron to collapsing. And the safety measures the government are asking for include things like propping up ceilings. The schools now are scrambling to address this issue. And if it's not fixed, I have to shut it down.

The risk of injury or death from a school building collapse was very likely all critical, according to a report by the National Audit Office back in June. And it highlighted concerns about RAAC in school buildings. The Department of Education hasn't given a timeline on replacing the RAAC.

@mattrieck_video_7357776099989867807.txt," People are telling me that they're applying to hundreds of jobs in their local areas and not getting calls back for interviews or even a return email for a rejection a lot of the time. So in this video today, I did a bunch of research to find jobs that people can do at home in customer service from their computer, some of which you don't even need to talk to people on the phone for. So I want to share these resources with you guys. The first company that's currently hiring is tesla.com forward slash careers. By the way, everybody, I put all the links for these jobs down in the videos so you can just go copy and paste them to be able to apply. So at tesla.com forward slash careers, again, you can make up to $28 an hour and you're going to be answering questions on Tesla social media channels. And this job also comes with Tesla benefits and perks. The next company that's hiring is cvs and cvs you can apply at jobs.cvshealth.com and these jobs pay up to $35 an hour. There's no experience required to start, but there's a sliding scale to make more. And the jobs do require a high school diploma. The jobs also come with cvs benefits. The next company that's hiring is American Express. They pay $22 an hour for customer service and you can apply at AmericanExpress.com forward slash careers and pay increases as you go in this job. And the last company on this video is going to be Disney. And Disney has jobs that can be applied for at DisneyCareers.com. These jobs pay up to $28 an hour and they also come with Disney benefits and perks. Now in addition to all of these jobs, I'm going to make another video that will have some more than I found for you guys, but I didn't want this to get too long. But I want to encourage you guys that even if you have never worked remote at home from before, you've never worked from your home computer, a lot of these jobs in addition to the things that were listed as far as compensation and benefits also either provide a computer or pay some or all of your internet access in order to facilitate you being able to do the job from home. And some of these jobs, like I said, there's no talking required. It's simply answering questions for customers either on their website or on their social media channels to be able to help customers that are having issues with their products and services. So in addition to that, I also want to encourage people that if you've only been applying for jobs locally, please realize that working a job that is remote or from home can have some additional benefits if you're either in a small town, if you're not in a metropolitan area city, or if you're in a state that has a lower minimum wage than some of these companies that have their headquarters in major population states like California or New York. So let me give you an example. Let's say you live in a state like Texas. And last time I checked in Texas, I believe the minimum wage is a little bit more than $7 an hour. If you apply to a state like California, where the minimum wage is over $16, then you are going to be automatically making more than you might be able to make in your local market. So at California, $16 an hour for someone living in Texas or these smaller population states can be a huge benefit to folks that are just trying to get a job right now and haven't had any success in their local area. If you guys have other companies that you have been successful, getting online jobs for that you want to help other people get jobs in 2024, please put them below so that people can go and apply. If you have any tips that will help these folks to be able to get hired at these or other companies, also please put them below so that we can help everybody possible that's looking for a job in 2024 and wants to get out there and work. I hope this helps and I'll see you guys in the next one.",subjective
@sherveen1_video_7222799812687645998.txt," I'm always looking for news that indicates some sort of micro trend that might be part of a bigger economic story. The past week has three good examples of this. First, we had McDonald's doing layoffs and that's a front-mind sort of business. It's retail, it's brick-and-mortar, it's about food, so core goods, and them doing layoffs after tech has kind of had its recessionary season or still going through their recessionary season was really interesting to me as an indicator that other businesses are starting to feel the burn. Then you have PC makers seeing a massive slump in sales, including Apple recently reporting that they're basically down 40% year on year. That might be some of the whole pulled-forward demand that we saw in general for a lot of companies during the pandemic. People are at home, they want laptops, they want tech, and now they have what they need, and they're going to be able to use older hardware for a little bit here. In general, the numbers look pretty stark. Yesterday it was the kicker. Amazon is starting to charge for some returns when it comes to EPS delivery. We think about the past decade and what Amazon's been trying to do with shipping. That definitely seems counter-trend to me. If you tie these three stories together, what do you see? These are businesses outside of the tech bubble, venture capital sector that has mostly been taking the brunt of the economic hit over the past year, and you're talking about businesses that we might have expected to be a little bit resilient until a true recession was going to hit. Again, these are just three stories, but I always like to find the micro trends that happen before we get the macro trend.",subjective

@madmedicine_video_7327792589103500586.txt," That's your mission! Amazon is now launching their own primary health care service for $9 a month. And I don't know about you, but health care is expensive, so I'm definitely looking into this, so let's check it out. So for the general public, people that are not Amazon Prime Members, you can get it for $199 a year. And then for primary members, you can get it for $99 a year. And then just to add an additional member, you can get it for $66. So the next few years in medicine are going to be extremely interesting to watch for many reasons. As we see more companies coming into the world of medicine, this will either end up very good, or it's going to suck even more. Now I'm an interim medicine doctor. I see patients in the hospital. I also see patients in my clinic, which are primary care patients. And I also see patients via telemedicine. I see all the gamut that we have. And I will tell you that telemedicine is only going to grow in popularity. You see before the pandemic, patients had to come in person to see their doctors. Telemedicine was not as widely adopted, but because the pandemic shut everything down, a lot of patients and doctors realized that they could see patients virtually. And really, we're not missing a lot of their care except for like a physical exam and their vitals. And for most young patients who are healthy, that's okay. We don't necessarily need that all the time to assess them. We just really need their history. Now because of the pandemic, because we've noticed that patients are able to be seen virtually, telemedicine has blown up. It's increased tremendously. And it's only going to keep increasing because doctors are able to have a more flexible lifestyle. Patients are able to be more flexible in terms of getting their care. And it's kind of a win-win situation if used properly. Now the fact that Amazon is noticing this is a huge plus for telemedicine. It means that it's only going to grow. Here's the problem though. At some point, Amazon knows that they have to make money. And the way they're going to make money is by physicians and providers seeing patients. So at some point, it's going to cost someone some amount of money, right? And we don't know where that's going to go. We don't know how that's going to end up. We don't know if insurance is going to get affected. If that's going to cost patients more, we don't know if patients are going to end up paying more prices. We don't know if providers are going to be unhappy and they're going to be forced to see 60 patients a day. We don't know any of that yet. Then that is really the uncharted territory with Amazon going into medicine. One thing is clear though, Amazon knows that they're going to be able to make a lot of money off of, honestly, patients being seen in the healthcare sector. They know that and that's why they're coming into this. I'm not going to say that they have some altruistic motive that they're coming into medicine to help people know. Amazon is first and foremost of business and they know that medicine is also a billion dollar multi-billion dollar industry where telemedicine is only going to grow and they see the money. They're coming for it. How that affects patient care, how that affects patient quality, honestly, we don't really know yet. People can say it's going to be horrible, people can say it's going to be great, but over time we will find out. I will say one thing about telemedicine. For many people, it's not the right choice and you should be seeing your doctor in person because we have to see you in a sex eclenically. However, for a lot of people, especially young people who are generally healthy, it may be a good option for them to get that routine care that often they end up missing out on. In those situations, it might be beneficial for you to pay a miniscule amount to get your routine care and make sure things don't get missed or other times that might get missed. We'll see.

Here you have to decide if you're going to incorporate or not. For my understanding, this is to separate you as an entity from your business so that in the case as a lawsuit, you yourself are not liable. If you have the funds, I say go for it. And also if you have a high risk product or service. After this, you get a registration number where you can open a bank account. This I also think is optional, but as an accountant, I really suggest that you separate your finances. Also now when you register your business, you also get a business number. You don't have to get a GSD number with this CRA on this to make over 30,000 a year. And then after that, you can get a business license and it's really easy to do online. And then after that, optional again, but you can get business insurance. And of course along the way, you're gonna be working on your social media and your website, but I'm not an expert at that.

@janelle_rb_video_7327350162307681578.txt, Question I get asked a lot by clients who I negotiate seven agreements for is can I apply for unemployment and when can I apply for unemployment? The first thing to consider is how is your severance payment being paid? Are you getting weekly or biweekly payments or are you receiving a lump sum payment? If you're receiving ongoing severance payments and those payments are less than the maximum unemployment benefit rate that you would be eligible for Then you can still apply for unemployment while you're receiving those severance payments. If the weekly payments you're receiving exceed the maximum unemployment benefit rate that you'd be eligible for then you should not be applying for unemployment while you're still receiving those payments. You may also still be able to apply for unemployment while you're receiving severance payments if your first severance payment was made longer than 30 days after your last day working. If you're receiving a lump sum payment they're going to calculate the weekly pro-rated amount of what that would be. And then the same rule applies. If it's greater than the maximum unemployment benefit rate you'd be eligible for then you shouldn't be getting it while you receive that payment. If it's not then you can still apply for unemployment. In order to save yourself the headache of being denied and then having to reapply or appeal I recommend that you wait until your severance payments are received and finished before you apply for unemployment. And when in doubt consult with an employment attorney.,subjective
@skellicose_video_7218791639454666026.txt," Yes, I can. So I specifically mentioned three of the theories for why things become a law or other things don't specifically stakeholder analysis narrative policy framework and window of opportunity. But before I get started on that, understand that public policy is an incredibly wide field. It's why I went into it to be good at it. You need to know your history, your law, your economics, your psychology. You need to know the present and all the stakeholders and the present and you need to know the future. You need to know how to be good at writing, you need to know how to be good at teaching, you need to know how to be good at convincing. Just a whole bunch of things together, just the ceiling is so high on it and that's why I wanted to go into it. It's a fascinating subject. I recommend it. Even mind that these three theories are alternate mental frames for why something is a law and other things aren't a law. Right. So window of opportunity, it's a law because the right window of opportunity happened for the law to be passed, whether that be a war or a depression or recession or a moral panic or a new technology or crazy election, the right situation happened for it to become a law. For an easy example, just think of economic regulation after a big crisis and then the window of opportunity passes when the economy is recovered and people forget about how horrid the recession or depression was in the first place. Another theory for the same thing is stakeholder analysis. Right. So for example, you wouldn't pass an airline regulation law if nobody was profiting off of airline flights yet. Right. You need the stakeholders who believe that something is to be gained or lost to involve themselves and this really requires people who know how to read people who understand who is close to the leave as a power, how to influence people. This is stakeholder analysis. Who's interested? Why are they interested? How are they getting stuff done? Analyzing a law in this way would be like, oh, this person, this person, this person, that person, we're all interested in the law becoming a law and only this person, this person, we're opposed and they're not close to the levers of power. Therefore, it's pretty easy to explain why it became a law. All end with narrative policy framework. This is the one I'm most interested in. It's also the newest one. It's the idea that a law is a law because it provided the most clean answer to a very easy to tell compelling story. And this theory relies more on psychology. It's the idea that people think of the world in stories. Like there's clear heroes, there's clear villains, there's an antagonist like a crisis that needs to be covered. And, you know, whoever has the best answer to that story, that's the answer that's going to get passed into law. Whether that be about abortion or intersex people or trans people or about criminal justice reform, etc. Whoever can tell the best story and their law is the clearest answer to that story, they're the ones who get their law passed. All right. So hopefully that introduction was good.",subjective

@zorayrmanukyan_video_7199515332426353962.txt," 5 economic trends affecting small businesses The global economy is constantly changing and evolving, and this has a direct impact on small businesses. To stay ahead of the curve, it's important to be aware of the latest economic trends and how they might affect your business. Here are some key economic trends by Zora or Monocyan that business owners need to watch out for in the coming year. 5 economic trends that will affect small businesses Rise of the Gig economy The Gig economy is a term used to describe the growing trend of people working freelance or short-term contracts instead of traditional full-time jobs. This trend is being driven by the increasing popularity of online platforms like Airbnb, Uber, and Etsy, which make it easy for people to find work that fits their schedules. While the Gig economy can offer flexibility and freedom, it also comes with some challenges. For businesses, the biggest challenge, according to Zora or Monocyan, is managing cash flow as income can be irregular. For workers, the lack of job security can be a worry. Rising inflation Because of the volatile economic situation globally, inflation is rapidly increasing in many countries. This means that the cost of living is going up, but wages are not keeping pace. This can be a real challenge for businesses as they have to find ways to increase prices without putting customers off. Moreover, businesses need to be extra careful about their cash flow as they may find themselves having to pay back loans at a higher rate than expected. Increase in minimum wage According to Zora or Monocyan, in many countries around the world, there's been an increase in the minimum wage in recent years. This is good news for low-paid workers, but it can be a challenge for businesses, especially small businesses with tight profit margins. To offset the increased cost of labor, businesses may need to raise prices or cut costs in other areas. Alternatively, they may look to automate tasks or replace human workers with technology. Growth of e-commerce The growth of e-commerce is having a major impact on the retail sector. More and more people are shopping online, which is putting pressure on brick and mortar stores. To compete with online retailers, brick and mortar stores need to find ways to stand out. This might involve offering unique products or experiences that can't be found online or making the in-store experience more convenient and enjoyable. More focus on sustainability As consumers become more aware of the environmental impact of their purchases, they are increasingly looking for sustainable options. This trend is being driven by a younger generation of consumers who are willing to pay more for products and services that have a positive impact on the environment. For businesses, this means there is an opportunity to differentiate themselves by promoting their sustainability credentials. To appeal to eco-conscious consumers, businesses can highlight their use of recycled materials, renewable energy or ethical manufacturing practices. The conclusion Zore Armanoquan has highlighted some important economic trends that are affecting businesses around the world. It's important to keep track of these trends and how they might impact your business. By doing so, you can make sure that you're prepared for whatever the future might hold. Thanks for watching.",subjective
@that_investor_video_7279962042335857962.txt," The food you eat in America is so toxic it's actually illegal in other countries. U.S. chicken is actually bathed in chlorine before being injected with saline solution and then packaged for sale. It's only up to 15% of the chickens weight in these packages can just be salty sugary water. It's supposed to be so it tastes better but like all season it myself thank you. The EU has banned the sale of American chicken because of this chlorine wash because believe it or not you're not supposed to consume chlorine. At least not in high doses. I mean it's in our tap water so it's literally inescapable. My name is Patrick and here are 10 more foods that are illegal outside of the United States. I guarantee you have some of them in your pantry. Since we started this with chicken I might as well let you know that U.S. pork is also banned. This is thanks to a controversial drug known as Ractopamine which is banned in about 170 out of the 196 countries in the entire world. Sea Ractopamine accelerates weight gain so that these animals become plump and we can get more bang for our buck as producers. Don't mind my conspiratorial brain here but last I checked we had no B.C.D. epidemic in the United States. Yeah I just checked. The CDC says about 74% of us are overweight at least as of 2020. It's almost like there's this weird incentive to keep us overweight and like slightly disease ridden. Not dead because then they can't profit 4.3 trillion dollars off of us. Annually. It's not profit it's net income I get it it's 18.3% of the entire GDP of our country. Anyway did you know that Twinkies are illegal not because of high fructose corn syrup but because of the yellow coloring. Those numbered food coloring such as red 40 which gives the maraschino cherries such a vibrant red color are banned for a good reason. Those colored dies are actually derived from crude oil you know petroleum this stuff that makes gasoline and carousine and diesel and plastic bags yeah we're eating it. It's widely known that these food coloring cause a host of physical and mental illnesses such as allergic reactions asthma ADD ADHD straight up immune deficiencies. Another epidemic here in the United States I mean how many of us here right now watching this video have ADD. Go ahead raise your hand in the comments is it clicking. Stovetop stuffing has BHA and BHT. A synthetic antioxidant which prevents vegetable oils from going rancid and is a common ingredient in plastic or wax paper lining for packages. That was BHT. BHA is actually an anti wrinkling agent so you know thanks givings coming up so rather than eat the stuffing just spread it on your face. Coffee mate coffee creamer full of hydrogenated seed oils same with rich crackers actually and in small amounts it's actually not that bad for us but the problem is it's everywhere. You're consuming too many seed oils and not enough I'm just going to call them meat oils that's when you get into problems see when I was studying nutrition our teachers would explain to us that it's more about the ratio between these two rather than just the over consumption of them. I'm going to end on a banger here and I would appreciate it if you would share this one out because I really do want people to understand what they're putting inside their bodies. Audi builders are going to love this one. Milk. US milk is banned outside of the US. Pump our cows full of growth hormones. Bovine growth hormone to be specific. It's a GMO hormone believe it or not which actually increases the cows production of milk. Researchers mixed on this one although conclusive enough to ban US milk in Canada, New Zealand, Japan. Some of the growth hormone gets into the milk and then increases our IGF1 which does help build muscle but also linked to breast cancer. Careful what you put inside your body because...",subjective

You can buy a profitable business and the bank will pay for it. I'll tell you how right now. My name is Legend. I am a business broker. Companies will hire me to come in, look through their financials, tell them how much they're worth currently and then find them a buyer, and then they pay me for that service. That being said, if you've got a million dollar company, that means they're probably doing 250,000 to $500,000 a year in profit. You can then go to the bank, the SBA, small business administration, get a loan called the SBA 7A that will pay up to 90% of that loan. $900,000. You've got to cough up 100 grand. I know it's not cheap, but you can do it. I believe in you. You can do that and then now buy that company and you're making 250 to $500,000 a year. There's a reason the rich get richer.

@ivy_roadmap_video_7274723931628555562.txt," 90% of the people who say they do science research are just faking it. So I'm going to show you how to do real science research and get published while you're still in high school. And you can keep your $5,000. Everything I'm about to say is totally free. There are three key components to real science research. First, you need to do it with a real mentor who's an actual scientist. Second, you need to do it in a real lab, not just your high school. And then third, you have to write a paper that's actually aimed at getting published. The first step is getting a mentor. And most people fail here because they're being selfish. You can't just cold email professors with no skills whatsoever and expect them to take you on their lab. On the bright side, this is really easy to fix. Just take any free data analysis course with Python. That'll actually make you a useful contributor to the lab. With skills like that, most mentors will let you work in a serious project, which guarantees that you're in the lab. And because you made all the plots and charts for their research, you're guaranteed to be a co-author on whatever paper they publish. And that's it. As long as you start early enough, you're guaranteed to have a publication before you apply to college. And this is definitely going to impress Idle League schools.",subjective

@foodsciencebabe_video_7306985845385530670.txt," Why are so many people scared of this? This is how folks not too long ago did food. There was no viral program, publics. All right, so if you're scared of those dry-cam potatoes and that looks unsafe to you, that's good because it should. There are so many excellent resources online if you wanna start canning or if you want to understand why this is unsafe. So let's take a look at some of those free resources. So this is from the USDA, dry canning vegetables without water or liquid may be extremely hazardous. The main risk with dry canning vegetables or other low-assed foods is the risk of botulism. Adding liquid allows for convection heating which is critical for proper heat transfer during processing. The National Center for Home Food Preservation has resources for you to can food safely. We go to this link here for canning white potatoes, cubed or whole. Here's the information for canning that food safely. So this includes all the information on how to prepare the vegetables for canning, including covering hot potatoes with fresh boiling water. Also includes information on the pressure canning process, including the process time and the canner pressure at different altitudes. You can also find excellent information on university extension websites. This is from Penn State Extension. Explaining why dry canning is not recommended. So without added liquid, heat is transferred via conduction which is a slower method of heat transfer. Bacteria and bacterial spores are more sensitive to wet heat and will be killed more rapidly. If vegetables are canned without the added liquid, the possibility exists that sea botulinum spores may not be destroyed. Canning is a science and that's why it's essential to use tested and research based recipes from reputable sources of information. And just because you may have used a process for a long time and you haven't gotten sick from it does not mean that it isn't risky or that there are safer ways to do it. So if you want to understand how to can safely, please get your information from reputable sources like I shared here or other university extension websites.",subjective

You just get to get what you get and then you get to have to make do. Maybe go back and see if they can have some other items that you need, sauce and whatnot or I'm sure you got some money.

Obviously you know if you tell me you know half of this can I expires this food it's it's completely ruined you know already open or broken and whatnot. Yeah I saw one can dent. Okay when I go grocery shopping and sometimes it's dent in the car. I don't see videos.

Again all of this is coming straight from the site and I don't know if this means that all states aren't participating in it or only these states but it says that these states will give it between 150 and $2,000 it breaks it down a little bit more here at the bottom apparently if you're in New York you would be eligible for up to $1,000 just because the cost of living in New York is just I feel sorry for y'all. That little bit of money they trying to give ain't much it ain't gonna do much but it's better than nothing.

We put this sheet over it to protect her skin. And we had to tie the sheet to the top of the bed because she keeps sliding down. So it is easy to get her up.

@thecognitivecorner_video_7168947993759059206.txt," We need to talk about loneliness. I'm going to share three ways to combat it, because research shows a prolonged social isolation and loneliness is equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Just let that sink in. So just so that we're on the same page, social isolation is about the quantity of social interactions. Our loneliness is about the quality of interactions. And because of the therapist, I work with social isolation and loneliness a lot, but I was also learning a lot from this educational video series I was watching called The Scientific Guide to Health and Happiness on One Dream. And that is a platform that houses a bunch of documentaries and educational series and lessons all led by experts in their field. And they have a wide selection of over 8,000 hours and new content that centers on mental health, which is my personal favorite. So number one, loneliness is not always need to be combated by another human. If you have access to an animal that can be such a helpful way to reduce loneliness. Number two, join a group. This could be a book club, a ski club, a foodie club, a support group of fitness class. Just being in proximity to other people increases your chances of developing relationships. And number three, say yes. And I know it's much easier said than done. And it can be so difficult if we struggle with mental health to go out and try new things. But the more that we say yes, is the more that we expose ourselves to potential relationships. So if you're looking for more in-depth content on topics like social isolation and loneliness, I highly recommend checking out One Dream. It is my favorite educational platform.

@annoyedlemon_video_7275439419204160814.txt," Many ER doctors and I have a very important food safety tip for you. Do not leave starchy foods. Oh my god, what the fuck is this doctor talking about? Bacterias in the rice and in the pasta? Well if you follow me you know girl, that this lemon's husband is a chef. He is a chef and he has been a chef, a big big chef for many many many years. And one of the things my husband will go to his grave, yelling at people, is one not to leave fucking food on the counter to cool off before you put it in the fridge to fucking store it. And two, don't seal rice especially or pasta hot in tapoware and then stick that hot ass sealed tapoware in your refrigerator. Because all you're doing is providing a nice little warm party for that bacteria to thrive in. There's something called the danger zone where food sits between 40 degrees Celsius, 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 140 degrees Fahrenheit. And anything in between girl is the danger zone where bacteria like the party. So you're putting food that's no longer hot like stove oven hot. You're putting it on the counter, bringing it to room temperature, rice especially in pasta that can take hours for that to happen, especially rice. It's like one of the number one culprits. It can stay warm for quite a while because it's all impacted and you know, so now the party's happening. The bacteria's happening. Also don't take that hot ass rice or whatever, put it in a tapoware, seal it with a lid and then put that in the refrigerator. Oh my god no, it's never going to cool down. It's not going to cool down in time. It's going to take fucking forever because you've sealed that hotness in and it's not going to get cold. So here's what you do. Let's say you made your rice dish. You're not going to eat at all. You want to save it for lunch tomorrow so you don't have to buy your lunch. You're going to put your rice in whatever vessel you're storing it in, tapoware glass, whatever. You're going to take a metal spoon, a big one like a serving metal spoon. You're going to stick it in the rice and then you're going to take that vessel and put it in the fridge without a lid. Just let the spoon stick right out of it. And that spoon, the metal spoon, it has to be metal. It's going to get cold. Metal gets cold, right? And it's going to bring that cold air and that cold temperature down into the rice and it's going to spread the coldness throughout the rice, getting it colder faster so it doesn't sit in the danger zone. You're going to give that like an hour or two until the rice gets nice and cold in the fridge. Then you're going to take the spoon out and then you can put the lid on it. That is how you properly bring something down to a refrigerated temperature. You could also do that with a hot soup that you make, you know hot mashed potatoes, whatever the hell it is. But if you want to avoid having to fucking poopy pants at the very minimum or winding up in the ER with this doctor, that is how you cool shit down. Never leave hot shit on a counter to come to room temperature and never put sealed hot containers of food in the refrigerator because it's just, it's not going to happen fast enough. So there you go. What do I always say my followers? The next time you get the poopy pants, it's not because you have a food sensitivity and it's most likely due to improper food handling either by yourself in your own kitchen or in a restaurant.

@marlene.ramir_video_7272859987305663787.txt," This may ruffle a few feathers, but I do not care. This comment is exactly the basis for my rationale as to why my brother who is both homeless and has a diagnosis of ponets schizophrenia, why he deserves treatment. A lot of disability rights advocates and a lot of people on the left want to simplify this issue and think of it as, you know, someone with an SMI they're able to advocate for themselves and they're able to refuse treatment because they're doing it out of their own volition and they're entitled to that. I 100% agree. I think anyone with an SMI should be able to advocate for themselves. The issue lies when people are untreated and they're left to fend for themselves and they're left to live on the streets and they don't have access to compassionate care because they are in the throes of either a psychotic episode or just don't believe that they have a mental illness to begin with. This commenter said it so eloquently. A lack of insight into your own mental illness is typically a symptom of severe and serious mental illness. It is called a no-cinosure and it's typically when a person is unable to distinguish the reality from their delusions. Someone is walking into my brother and they tell him, hey, maybe we should get you some more adequate care and maybe get you some housing, get you access to more wraparound services. He will tell you that he is not sick or he will just straight up refuse He will refuse even though his feet are literally black from walking around the streets for weeks and months. He will refuse even if the clothes on his on his back are hanging out. They're just like completely destroyed. He will refuse even if he is incredibly sick and there is like gangrene on his foot, which actually has happened before. This is not if I was in that condition. If somebody else was in that condition, I can guarantee you I would not want anyone to leave me like that and to say that it's within my rights to walk the streets to be subjected to violence day in and day out. But people who don't have that proximity to those experiences, people who've never had to deal with a sibling or a family member who has a severe mental illness, they will never understand that because in their mind, while I understand their rationale that folks with disabilities should be protected, I understand that. But folks with schizophrenia like my brother words just untreated and out of control. It is it is you cannot justify that to me in any single way.",subjective

@supermariozelaya_video_7295905041708305670.txt," Layoffs are going to start happening and I'm going to help you guys because we're going to enter into a recession. The US and Canada have subtle differences in unemployment insurance, but in Canada it's called employment insurance. In the US, unemployment insurance is paid by the employer, whereas in Canada, employment insurance, which is the same thing, just more politically correct, it is paid by the employer and the employee. Now truth be told, it's not that great. The money that you get isn't quite what it seems. You can get up to 55% of your earnings, but it maxes out at $61,500 per year, which means on a weekly basis you get $650 max. So what that means is if you earn, say today, $60,000, they're going to pay you 55% of that, but here's the kicker. You got to pay taxes on that. Employment insurance or unemployment insurance in the US is not tax-free money. So even though as Canadians you're paying into it and your employer is paying into it, when you need it most, you will be taxed on it. So your income is going to be basically be cut in half. If you earn, say, $100,000 per year, your income is going to be much more than 55% because remember it maxes out at 55% and then you're still going to get taxed on it. Currently, EI is not set up to pay a living wage, neither in Canada nor in the US. Once you factor the cost of living, food, gas, insurance, car payments, even though you're paying a premium or your employer is paying a premium to actually have you get that benefit, it doesn't mean it is there to protect you.

@theathletedietitian_video_7277983174712511790.txt," Welcome to Food Safety for First Timers. My name is Kendall and I'm a registered dietitian that works with collegiate and professional athletes and today we are going to be talking more about the temperature danger zones. I really like this graphic so we're going to continue to use this one. Why is it called the Danger Zone? It has been studied by food scientists that in this range from 40 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit that this is where bacteria can grow rapidly. Why is this dangerous? Right? Like a little bacteria, a little dirt, I used to drink out of the garden hose never hurt me. I will be doing an entire video on the different types of foodborne illnesses. But just like that first video, if there is an excessive amount of different types of bacteria growing in your food that you ingest, it can make you very ill. That original story was actually talking about someone that left a pasta dish out on the counter, did not store it properly, that ended up getting ill. So let's discuss first hot foods. You will see over on the right-hand side, minimal internal temperature for safety. These are for different meats. This is to kill off any bacteria that is growing or may exist already in these raw meats. As most of you know, you should not be eating raw meat unless it has been prepared in a specific way to prevent bacterial growth. The key here is you want to keep hot food hot. That's why when you go to restaurants such as Chipotle, you see those cooked food sitting out in the little dishes. There are warming trays under there that keep them warm. If it was to just be sitting out for hours, after about hour four, that's kind of pushing it. They really say after two hours, it should be put into the fridge. But four hours max not being held at a warm temperature. That's when bacteria is going to start to grow when we're in the steam-ger zone. So no, if you leave out your pasta on the stove for an hour, you go back for leftovers, not necessarily at risk just yet. Totally okay to go back. Have another bowl. I want to kind of keep these short so you guys pay attention. So next we're going to talk about leftovers and reheating of warm foods.",subjective
