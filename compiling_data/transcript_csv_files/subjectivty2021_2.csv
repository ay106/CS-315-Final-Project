@3reecrossingradio_video_7310787953117187371.txt," And later, when Trump does take the stage, we're going to walk down to the Capitol. Some here are his words as a call to action. You'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be straight. We've made the Capitol building. You're going to break it. Take the Capitol and make it happen. Take the Capitol and make it happen. The Capitol right now! We're going to be marching over to the Capitol building. Two hours before this, the proud boys were already heading for the Capitol. They're clearly spoiling for a fight with far left agitators like Antifa, who they believe are in DC. Where's Antifa? But there are moments that suggest that... Come on. Where is Antifa? And while we're at it, where's the FBI? Where is BLM? It looks to me like... That's a bunch of Trump supporters, right? He's joined by other well-known proud boys like Joe Biggs, an organizer from Florida, Dominic Pazola, a former Marine, and Billy Christman. They will be among the first writers inside the Capitol building. Ah! Yeah! From the speaking, some of his other supporters also headed to the Capitol. Woo! Ready, fire, three! And the tone is becoming menacing. We're going to destroy the fucking Capitol! Fuck you, fuckers! You are safe! Just ahead, officers guarding the building are understaffed and ill-equipped for what's coming their way. You're the biggest! The building is more than two football fields in length. The barricades erected on the east side are defended by just a few dozen officers. The west side, facing Trump's rally, is even lighter. The fencing has been extended, and on the northwest approach only five officers stand guard. Around five also defend the southwest approach, a few more dot the lawn, and about a dozen officers are behind them. Hmm. Fans to storm the Capitol. Still, no BLM, or Antifa, or the FBI, just a bunch of Trump supporters. Police are so outnumbered, they're forced to retreat again to more tightly defend access points to the Capitol. It's now five minutes into the siege that the Capitol Police Chief calls for backup from local law enforcement, known as the Metropolitan Police, and asks other Capitol leaders to mobilize the National Guard. You took a nose! Does that not mean a damn thing to you, does it? Metro Police will arrive within 15 minutes, but for reasons we'll explain later, the National Guard will arrive for over four hours. Meanwhile, more Capitol Police come to reinforce the line. It's the first time we see officers in riot here. Still, no BLM, Antifa, or the FBI, just a angry mob of Trump supporters who are now attacking the police officers. Yes, they are attacking the blue. And it's later reinforcements from the Metro Police arrive. A high ranking Metro officer immediately calls for more backup. Did you just go up to help make a line? They're pulling five pounds. They struggle to subjuge rioters who respond with their own chemical spray. And within 30 minutes, the police already have casualties. Multiple Capitol injuries in all caused by Donald Trump's supporters. Wow! The Capitol is now surrounded. The rioters haven't made it inside yet, but around the time that the mob on the east pushed forward, rioters on the west were making a pivotal move. Wow. This scaffolding was erected for the upcoming inauguration of Joe Biden. MAGA has no respect for law enforcement and it's very clear. Just look, no respect for the rule of law at all. And yes, once again, these are Trump supporters. It's an auto mayhem and it's about to get worse. The scene is being filmed from countless angles, allowing us to piece together moment by moment what comes next. The police shield is still to bash in a window. At 2.13 pm, the Capitol is breached. Michael Sparks, a Trump supporter from Kentucky, is the first person inside. A police officer seems unsure of what to do and backs off. Sparks is followed by proud boys and other far-right extremists. One carrying a Confederate flag, another armed with a baseball bat. When rioters break open the locked doors, hundreds more rushing. This is a critical moment. Officers must now defend the outside and inside of the building, stretching them even further. Yeah, no matter how many hours of footage, Mike Johnson or the man before him, Kevin McCarthy releases. It will not erase what we all just saw. Donald Trump instigated his supporters to get them to attack the United States Capitol. This is definitely Donald Trump's fault and the fault of all of the supporters that went along with this. So no more of this BLM Antifa or FBI nonsense. You can go watch this footage right here and see all the Trump flags. All right. Trump supporters! Get those knee pads and those elbow pads ready. Because Jack Smith and Fanny Willis, oh, and Latisha James, they're coming and they're coming to get you.",subjective

@90secondexplanations_video_7126640187362348330.txt," The United States government explained in 90 seconds. The US government can be broken up into two main parts, the federal and state governments. This is outlined in the Constitution, a document signed and adopted in 1787 after the short coming of the articles of Confederation. The 10th Amendment pretty much states that any task not allocated to the federal government under the Constitution becomes the responsibility of the state, which I will elaborate on in further videos. Now the Constitution outlines the core of the federal government into three branches, the legislative executive in judicial. The legislative branch includes all of Congress and is tasked with introducing and passing laws among other powers like confirming Supreme Court justices. On the contrary, the executive branch has an obligation to help enforce those laws. This branch consists of the President, the Vice President, and his Cabinet, or advisors, and their agencies. Finally, we have the judicial branch, which interprets and then rules on laws. Although consisting of many levels, the highest court in the United States is the Supreme Court, which in terms of laws are constitutional or unconstitutional. Now one of the brilliant things about the US government is the checks and balance system. Basically, a series of ways that each branch can ensure that one branch doesn't become too powerful. A perfect example is the previously mentioned power for Congress to approve Supreme Court justices, nominated by the President.",objective

@achantetheblogger_video_7251208453740301611.txt," Happy Sunday y'all. I wanted to hop on here really quickly in my authentic form because I wanted to express what was in my mind about me deactivating my Facebook. This video is gonna be in the role. I'm a little emotional. I don't know good ones bad ones whatever but I see now why people post videos and then crying on the internet. Yeah. So I've had the same Facebook page since 2007. I've had the same Facebook page for 16 years. I've never like started a new page. I've never gotten hacked or anything like that. And so many people who are not familiar with TikTok always talk shit about TikTok right? They're like I don't have a TikTok and whatever people have their misconception about what it is. But what they don't realize is TikTok is more of who you are and not what TikTok is. And with Facebook I feel like it's a little different. And I've been putting this all finn has been weighing heavy all me like for the last few months and the reason why I didn't want to deactivate it and create a new page yet is because my mother passed away a couple years ago and I'm the legacy holder or I'm the legacy person on her account which means I can access her account and make decisions post on her page delete friends add friends and everything like that. I didn't want to let that last connection go but it's time. I don't know about you guys but I went through a phase where most people do like where I was adding every single friend request or adding every single suggestion if I knew if I had enough mutual friends and there's like almost 5,000 people in my Facebook and I couldn't tell you how many of them I actually know. I have some important photos on there, some good content you know things like that like from my blog, from my rental, some really really important memories that I hold dear to my heart so I know that it's going to be a process and with everything already have going on I know this is going to take me maybe a week or two to actually save the things I want from my Facebook and put it to the side. But what I finally understand and what I need to understand is that like waking up and getting on social media that is putting a lot of bad things or not bad things but like a lot of emotionally draining or emotionally pulling things or triggering things like in your face and the morning or anytime of day to get a distraction you know we scroll in there for a boosa serotonin or whatever and we get a notification and we're like oh you know that just puts us in a better mood hormonally right instantly for just a moment of instant gratification but there are so many things that are like trash on my Facebook trashed me that put me in a bad headspace. Like a lot of times I would just see something and you know just keep scrolling whatever not interact with it you know because it's freedom of speech right anybody can post whatever they want on their page I'm not saying I'm better than anybody else I'm not saying that I'm not saying I'm judging anyone else like who am I to judge I have some things on my Facebook over the last 16 years that I'm sure I would not think about posting today. Like the other day there was some random guy that posted corn right I instantly unfriended unfollowed them. There was someone else that posted like the super massagingistic comment on someone's page there's someone that posted this gorgeous heavy set white girl with like piercings and pink hair and it was a new profile picture that she made for herself and somebody shared her profile picture saying why are we low in our standards so much there are people that are my real friends in my and our friends in my real life that are friends with people on social media that like just judge judge judge or talk so mean like just talk so mean about people and and it's just it's overwhelming sometimes the video that just took me out that I saw was like someone posted a video of like six guys jumping someone and jail and stabbing him to death while someone recorded and he posted it and was like damn I know that Facebook and other social media can be used like you to keep us in a loop for the news right with these new generations everyone like having you know us having that worldwide like touch where we can see what's going on all the world when it's not really covered in the news I get that and I also understand that it helps to keep connections with people that are far away that you won't see for years. My TikTok feed expresses or falls in line with who I am as a person so yes I will be deactivating my Facebook and I will be creating a new Facebook page I'm not worried about the friend count anymore I'm 33 who cares about that I'll add the people that I actually have connections with that I actually know because all those examples of those posts that I saw it was from people that I'd have no idea who they are and we're friends so anyway it's going to be like an emotional process I won't be able to again access my mom's account anymore I'll still be able to see her account you know I'm not going to deactivate her Facebook or anything like that because I could I'm not going to deactivate her Facebook back and always go back and scroll through her pictures and things like that but as far as for me I'm going to take the next couple of days or week or whatever and pull all the members that I want to keep and then I'll create a new Facebook page with everything I have going on in my life mentally and physically and everything like that and everything that you may have going on in yours it may be time for you to reflect and remove some things that you know would be triggering for that anyways happy Sunday thanks for coming to my TED Talk and I don't know have a good day",subjective

In many ways, a perfunctory response, and it doesn't confirm anything, but in Trump's world where a loyalty is such an important thing, and anyone who turns on Trump is seen as disloyal or anyone following legal procedures, the scene is disloyal.

Well, the New York Times is reporting that Jack Smith did in fact sit down with Mark Meadows the rat, which explains why he hasn't showed his face this entire time. A potential bombshell in Jackson's twin investigations into Donald Trump. New York Times reported seven minutes ago that Mark Meadows, he was Donald Trump's chief of staff at the end of the presidency when the documents were taken as well as on January 6th, as events also under investigation by Jack Smith. Times just dropped a story. Under this headline, Mark Meadows has testified to Grand Jury in Special Counsel investigation of Trump. We will read from it, Mark Meadows, the final White House chief of staff under President Donald Trump and a potentially key figure. An inquiry is related to Trump has testified before a federal grand jury hearing evidence in the investigations being led by the Special Counsel's office that is according to two people briefed on the matter. Trump's is a figure in both of the two distinct lines of inquiry being pursued by the Special Counsel appointed to oversee the Justice Department's scrutiny of Trump. And, of course, Jack Smith, the Times goes on to report this. One inquiry is focused on Trump's efforts to cling to power after losing the 2020 election culminating in the attack by a pro-Trump mob on the Capitol. During congressional certification of the Electoral College results on January 6th, the other is an investigation into Trump's handling of hundreds of classified documents after he left office and whether he obstructed efforts to retrieve them. Times reports this, it's not clear precisely when Meadows testified, or if investigators questioned him about one or both of the cases.",subjective
@ahayah1980_video_7209829874977082666.txt," I'm a conflore to Mr. Gates for five minutes. Mr. Storch, you're our watchdog. Ukraine has a corruption problem, right? There's a long history of issues with corruption in Ukraine. Infrastructure minister arrested for stealing $400,000. Deputy head of Zelensky's office can't explain where the sports cars came from. So he had to resign. Deputy defense minister resigned over contract in corruption, but the defense ministry put out a statement that his resignation was a worthy deed. And the wife of a former Ukrainian politician was found with $22 million in cash crossing the border into Hungary last year. Seems as though a lot of the zeal for enforcement of the anti-corruption effort seems to align with the Republican control the House of Representatives in our country. Maybe that's a coincidence. But let's get to this end-use monitoring you testified to. The arms control act of 1996 requires end-use monitoring for certain defense articles that are sold or leased, right? Correct. There's no feature of anything we've passed that exempts what we've given to Ukraine from those requirements in the arms control act, right? Not exempts their different provisions as to how that plays out, different circumstances. But that is controlling law, controlling policy. And here's the upshot. As you testify here today, you cannot testify truthfully under oath that the DOD has complied with the policy and law regarding end-use monitoring all times in this conflict, isn't that right? So I want to be careful here when I respond to you, Congressman, to make sure that I'm clear. We are conducting a series of evaluations that look at the controls that DOD has in place to ensure that they are taking the steps that are required. And I get all that. But here's the operative question. We haven't complied with end-use monitoring, according to the law, with everything we've sent to Ukraine to date, have we? So our 2020 report, which is our last public report on this, made a number of recommendations. All of those have been made. I know. I know, but you're sort of dodging the question. You cannot testify that we have complied with the end-use monitoring requirements at all times during this conflict, can you? So are we have an ongoing evaluation? I get that it's ongoing. I'm looking backwards. You cannot testify that everything is complied with the law in the end-use monitoring, can you? So some of that gets into the classified report that we should previously. I think everyone watching this could see that if you could testify to that, you would. You're citing a classified report. I don't know why that reports classified. I think the American people deserve to know if this 1996 law is being followed or not.",subjective

The incident happened near the end of the Trump presidency, when pro-Trump protesters stormed the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. They are trying to prevent Congress from formally certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election, claiming that the vote was rigged. The attack led to an emergency shutdown of Congress, the evacuation of lawmakers and congressional staff, and some injuries and even deaths. The incident shocked the world and highlighted political divisions and social unrest within the United States. The event had a major impact on the United States. First, it raises concerns about democracy, the rule of law, and the integrity of elections. The international community questioned America's democratic image and denounced the attack on the Capitol as a threat to democratic values. Second, shocks have further exacerbated political divisions. Various parties have different interpretations and responses to the incident, which has intensified the atmosphere of political confrontation and confrontation. President Trump was impeached a second time by the US House of Representatives for encouraging violent insurrection. Third, the incident raises questions about America's domestic security and policing system. Investigations were launched into failures to protect the parliament building and discussions on police reform and enhanced security measures were prompted. Finally, the shocks have also galvanized global attention to the problem of extremism.

The real impetus is actually to remove educators at all levels, whether they're on the school board, whether they're superintendents, principals, or teachers. Remove folks that are actually thinking critically about race and power dynamics and how we can create schools and honestly communities that are safe and affirming for folks that have been historically oppressed.

@amoralee06_video_7236930101592493355.txt," Thank you. Thank you so much to all of our colleagues here who have made such incredible and forceful arguments. I want to reiterate one point. The reason why anyone is asking anyone on this stage about what we would vote for is because Kevin McCarthy needs our votes. Because Kevin McCarthy doesn't have the votes. Because Kevin McCarthy is going to the White House without a majority of his caucus. He does not have what is necessary to negotiate. And for any question about what anybody would settle for, he has responsibility to concede. So if he wants any democratic support, he has to come to the table. And we have seen him over and over again say that he will not negotiate, that they are engaged in hostage-taking, not negotiation, extortion, not conversation. And that is not something we can establish. It is not something we can reinforce in this country. The proposal that we see on this table right now, that Kevin McCarthy and Republican caucus have put down has been an absolute rejection of the same reckless tax cuts that were passed in 2017, that we said at the time would explode the debt ratio that would explode the deficit. And now, several years later, we are in this scenario. And instead of them recognizing the error of their ways, they want to protect tax cuts on yachts and private jets and make single moms pay for it. And that's where we say no. That's where we say American people did not elect house progressives so that we can lay back while people's food benefits are cut. We're here to fight for working families. And so this is the last pocket to ask, what are we going to give up in terms of people's food, in terms of people's health care, in terms of veterans? And the time is now to ask the Republican caucus why they are valuing billionaires over veterans and single mothers. This is shameful. We can put an end to it. And it only takes five of the 18 Republicans that are in Biden-carried seats.",subjective

So now let's tackle freedom of the press. Here are some key cases. First let's talk about Gitlow, V. New York. This case was decided in 1925. And the reason this case is so important is because it's this case that incorporated freedom of press and freedom of speech to the states. I've talked about the incorporation doctrine before but just know not all rights in the Bill of Rights have been incorporated to the states. But freedom of the press was through the Gitlow case. Next we've got people V. Croswell. This case was way before that in 1804. It's an interesting case having to do with libel, Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. So take a look at that one. After that we've got near V. Minnesota and this is a particular case regarding prior restraint on publications and whether or not it's constitutional. And along with the near case we have New York Times V. U.S. and this is the 1971 case that has to do with President Nixon and the Vietnam War. Next we have New York Times V. Sullivan, which is a separate case in 1971. This has to do with the defamation test regarding public figures. Then we have Garrison V. Louisiana. This was decided in 1964 and it sets out more information on that reckless disregard for the truth when it comes to publishing something. And next we've got Hazelwood School District V. Colmeyer. This case was decided in 1988 and it's set out that school newspapers are a different animal than regular newspapers. And the way that they can be regulated is much different.

@awkwardmama107_video_7345180151111552286.txt," What is your priority leading the RNC right now? Well, you just heard from the top law enforcement officer in the country, Mayor Garland, that he doesn't want voter ID anywhere, that he wants to basically give access as I just heard from him to anyone, whether they are legally able to vote or not. That is a huge problem. We have three pillars that we need to focus on at the RNC to ensure victory on November 5. We have to vote, protect the vote and raise money. But I would argue that maybe the most important of those three is protecting the vote. Election integrity. We have to ensure that when people go vote, they feel like their vote counts, that they are inspired to go vote. We can never allow what happened in 2020 and the question surrounding that election to ever happen again. So I'll tell you right now what is already underway at the RNC. We have for the first time ever an election integrity division. This means vast resources dedicated solely to this cause. We are going to have, and we've already started working on, and I'll tell you Monday, we're going to expand all of it, a nationwide network of volunteers, whether it's poll watchers, trained poll workers. These are people who can physically go in, count ballots that are coming in, know how many are coming in, how many are going out, volunteer and paid attorneys. If you are an attorney who wants to volunteer, we want you, DonaldJTrump.com, GOP.com. Please come volunteer. And we currently have 78 lawsuits out right now in 23 states across this country to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat. And here's what I want to say to anyone out there who is thinking about cheating and an election. We will go after you. You will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. It is not worth it. Every person in this country, Maria, whether you are Republican or Democrat, should want free, fair and transparent elections. That's what we're going to focus on. Well, look, you just heard A.G. Garland, you are going to be fighting up an uphill battle because they do not want voter IDs. He said he's going to vow to stop states that have voter IDs. And you have to question whether or not this is about the 10 million illegals who have come into this country on Joe Biden's watch. I had a friend the other day tell me she was standing at a food truck. Two gentlemen approached her. One had tattoos all over his face. They looked like illegals, she said. And one had a clipboard and he said to her, hello, miss, do you want to sign up to become a Democrat and vote? So you're talking about people that you want to hire, they're already doing that. And they may be doing it with illegals coming into this country. Yeah. Well, you do have to ask yourself, why would you not want something so basic like voter ID? And I think you're right. People say, why do we have a fully open Southern border? Why is it you're willing to allow fentanyl to pour over and kill 100,000 Americans a year? Why is it you're allowing 169 people on the terror watch list last fiscal year to come over? And I think the only thing people can figure is that the Democrats are bleeding and hemorrhaging voters. They understand that they cannot fool people in this country any longer. But they have to import people. And the only reason you wouldn't want voter ID is if you want people who cannot vote to vote in these elections. It is insane.

Well, you said in a Fox North article that you were going to take 30 days and investigate it and it took you six months. In a six month investigation, you guys didn't learn what codacity meant? I think you know. I think every person that's going to watch this exchange knows you know. She's trying to lash audaciousness with someone being Caucasian, isn't she? I have no idea, Congressman. Wow. What an investigation. Well, I did not do the investigation. I will say I did not do the investigation. She is a GS employee that's employed by Dodia. Well, Dodia conducted the investigation. Gosh, the Pentagon told Fox News Digital that Gilsis Narrows would provide a final decision in 30 days. So they gave, so someone at the Pentagon is throwing your name out there as being responsible for this and now it looks foolish that you're suggesting you don't know what that means. Well, I would say that. Hold on. That quote in that comfort. Let's go to this, Mr. Narrows. What's a PD session? My guess would be personal development. Personal development. You don't think it's professional development? Another open matter for the investigation that it didn't resolve. So you don't know what codacity means. He's obviously talking about professional development there. And like when she says, I had to stop or let's go to the next claim. The codacity to say that black people can be racist too. Mr. Narrows, can black people be racist too? I've already stated, Congressman, that I didn't agree with her statements. But I'm asked about that. But I'm asked about that. Can black people be racist? This question is about me or my personal beliefs. But again, I don't. I don't know eating official over DEI. I don't agree. A racist person who works for you puts out these tweets. And you won't say whether you agree or disagree with me. I told you I said, Chairman, I don't remind members of the reserve standards of decorum and their statements. This is decorum. It's my time. Can black people be racist? I do not agree with that tweet. Do you agree with that statement? I'm asking you a statement. Can black people be racist? I'm not going to answer that, Congressman. Why not? Because it's you're asking me a personal opinion. And that's not what this is about. Actually, I'm asking you in your capacity as a senior DOD official in the Biden administration who is where we see recruiting falling off the table, whether or not the embrace of racist tweets, whether shuffling these people around rather than firing them, and whether this little exchange here is helping or hurting recruiting, let's go ahead and put up the recovery. I will tell you we do not support racist tweets. We do not support racism. Well, did you fire this lady? Again. You hired her? As I say, I did not hire her. As she was. You hired her? As it was stated earlier, she's a DOD employee. She's a GS employee. The inquiry that was done said these tweets were done on a personal matter. Oh, a personal matter. How do you know it's a personal matter? It was done on a personal matter. You don't know that the PD stands for professional development. And Mr. Cisneros, this is a professional development session where she attacked white colleagues and took the position that black people can't be racist. Now, you can't answer basic questions about it. And here's what I would propose to you. This is what we're looking at in recruiting right now. It's fallen off the table. And when you have employees that you don't fire who do racist things and say racist things, then you really hurt the ability to recruit people who want to be part of an inclusive and diverse force. I would say the data that we have is not, the recruiting is not falling off because of that. But again, the Department of Defense, DUDIA does not agree with the tweets that she made. It was in the re-adclostering the work day. You didn't fire her. If someone puts out racist things, do you fire them or do you just move them around? That was not an official. That was not an official. That's her own personal account. Here's the problem with the double standard, Mr. Cisneros, when Caucasian members of the military post about the Second Amendment or supporting building the wall, you all seem to be on a white supremacy snipe hunt. You seem to take people's personal views and weaponize them against them. And I've had people in my district to serve that wonder whether or not some joke that they forwarded or mean that they liked is going to result in the ruining of their careers.

That was never- But the Pentagon said it was you. I don't know who the Pentagon said that, but I will tell you it was a misstatement. Mr. Chairman, I seek to enter- The investigation was conducted by DOD because she's a DOD employee. If you just fired racist people, then maybe you wouldn't have to go through this.

@banditgio171_video_7214528560025881862.txt," I want to welcome everyone to this hearing of the Military Personnel Subcommittee. Today's hearing is focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion and its impact on the Department of Defense and the Armed Services. I want to thank our witnesses for being with us today. I hope this hearing provides the opportunity for our members to have a productive exchange with our witnesses and provide answers to their questions. Let me set the stage by saying the military services continue to be one of the most merit-cratic organizations in the United States of America. Thanks to the principles established by President Truman in Executive Order 9981, that there shall be equal treatment and opportunity for all persons in the Armed Services without regard to race, color, religion, or national origin. These principles enabled me a working-class kid from Indiana to be the first of my family to go to college and later joined the Navy Reserves and served my country in uniform. That is what meritocracy provides, an opportunity for everyone, regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, or gender, to raise your right hand to serve your country and to succeed on hard work and determination alone. And that is why I've what I found in the Navy. No evidence of widespread racism, just sailors of every color background of religion, working hard to get the mission done. But we are now in danger of losing those merit-cratic principles to the politicization of our armed forces. Thanks first and foremost to the ever-expanding bureaucracy of diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, regulations, and trainings. This DEI apparatus is based in faulty science and misguided principles. In fact, anti-biased training efforts may be, quote, having literally any effect, including to actually increase bias. In a review of 418 prejudice reduction experiments, Elizabeth Levy Palak and her co-authors concluded that much of the anti-basis training is, quote, misguided. And even in the few studies that showed any effect at all of reducing bias, those effects actually disappeared over a short period of time. Yet the Department of Defense and the services have embraced DEI training full cloth without empirical evidence. And worse, they very well may be increasing racism and division in our military. This comes at a time when existential threats from China and Russia have never been as pronounced as what they are. And at a time when recruiting struggles, put our all-volunteer force on the brink. With these looming threats, we must emphasize the readiness of our armed forces. In a response to then-ranking member Senator James Inhoff of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Chairman Milley reported that DOD expended $359,311 man hours for Secretary Austin's extremism stand-down, and an additional 529,711 man hours for DEI-specific training. That is a lot of training hours spent away from honing, war fighting capabilities, knowledge and skills. Chairman Control the military is the bedrock of our system, and avoiding partisan political ideology is essential to the strength and viability of our military. Chairman Milley crossed the line during an armed services committee hearing in the summer of 2021. He testified that it's important to study critical race theory because, quote, I want to understand the white rage. What is it that made thousands of people assault this building and try to overturn the constitution of the United States of America, end quote? The highest-ranking military officer in our armed forces interrupted the Secretary of Defense, connected racism to the Capitol riot, all to score partisan political points while wearing the uniform. And we be surprised by the erosion of trust between the administration and our service members, or between our military and the American public. This cannot continue. Our service members and our nation deserve a military that does not make ideological judgments. I agree with Secretary Austin, who testified in the same hearing that all service members and DOD civilians, quote, deserve an environment free of discrimination, hate, and harassment. I want us to work together to develop a system that remains true to our meritocratic values that ensures the performance of all service members provide opportunity, not because of the color of their skin or the God that they pray to, but because they have worked hard and identify as soldiers, sailors, Marines, airmen, and guardians. This is very personal for me. I was the product of a meritocratic system that afforded a boy from Indiana an opportunity to go to college and serve my country in uniform later and now to become a member of Congress. And I want to make sure that we do everything we can to preserve that system, the American system. That is a difficult topic with passionate voices all around, not because we hate each other but because we all want what is best for our country and the men and women in uniform. Before hearing from our witnesses, let me offer ranking member Kim an opportunity to make any opening remarks.",subjective

@bluesky_3333___video_7295434844446756138.txt," Let me ask you about some developments surrounding President Biden this week. One, we spoke to leaders in Michigan who said they were concerned that he is losing support among Arab and Palestinian citizens there because of his full-frored support in Israel. That also came against the backdrop of Congressman Dean Phillips announcing he is running against President Biden. Are you concerned that in a general election, both of these things, could weaken President Biden's chances? Well, let me say, Kristen, that I have been one of President Biden's biggest supporters. I have been proud to be a partner as he has been courageous and strong on the domestic front. He has really called out the injustices for average working Americans across this country. But is he going to be weakened, conversely, with new age-up workers? Well, I feel like I need to say this because what I think is that the President needs to be just as courageous on this issue so that we keep the unity within our country for the support of the incredible things he has done. He is, I think, going to be challenged to explain an issue of this moral significance to people. The American people are actually quite far away from where the President and even Congress, the majority of Congress, has been on Israel and Gaza. They support the right for Israel to defend itself, to exist, but they do not support a war crime exchanged for another war crime. And I think the President has to be careful about that. And I would call him, because I know him well. I've had breakfast with him. I've had the honor of working with him. I would call him to bring us to a higher place, to let the American people, to really call to the American people on a moral issue of this nature. And then I think we can go forward and talk about the incredible things that he has done. But I am certainly concerned about his approach to this. And listen, my colleague Dean Phillips, everyone's got the right to run. But I'm sorry, I have no idea what he is running on that is different from what President Biden is running on. He took the same bold stances that President Biden has taken in this country on domestic issues. And I really don't see what he's doing. That's not the point for me. The point is, I want President Biden to be the next President. And he needs to call us to a higher moral place.",subjective

And basically put them on notice that providing material support to Hamas is illegal. They write quote, we will continue to follow your reporting to ensure that your organizations do not violate any federal or state laws by giving material support to terrorists abroad. Now your organizations are on notice, follow the law. Wow. So the AGs continue to define what material support would mean. They're criminalizing freedom of the press. And so it cancel culture, anti-freedom, and going after the press. If you dare criticize Israel, we might put you in jail in America. This is crazy. And I'm also curious about what this would mean for ordinary Americans, right? Let's say their ordinary Americans who are on social media, they come across certain content that they want to share, but that content is labeled or considered propaganda from Hamas and disseminating it or sharing it would amount to providing support for Hamas. Does that mean that ordinary citizens would get prosecuted or investigated? I'm serious, I know that sounds hyperbolic and crazy, but this is such a vague law. So what, you're not allowed to criticize a political movement? That's insane. Our Congress has lost its mind. Our Congress is totally and utterly corrupt. So everyone who signed on to that bill is a total disaster. Well, a lot of people did. The House voted in favor of the resolution and it passed 311 to 14, only 14 members of Congress voted against it. All 311 people of those are corrupt. They are. That's an outrageous, ridiculous, un-American, unconstitutional bill to pass. By the way, spring courts just shrank that down.

@burnerlearner_video_7206392363067968810.txt," Here's what Iowa Republicans are up to in the last month or so. So we had our first funnel deadline, bills that don't make it through these committees are not eligible for their consideration, so everyone tries to shove a bunch of things through quickly. Their priority seems to be a bunch of bills aimed at trans kids. One example, school district employees would need parental permission to use a nickname or pronoun for a student that's not on the child's birth certificate. A camera on his lobbyist says that parents should have the ultimate responsibility and right to decide what is in the best interest of their children, including when it comes to their education. None related news, committee passed a bill banning gender-forming care for minors, moved that contradicts the guidance of doctors in state and national medical association, so much for the parents having the right to decide. Lawmakers advance the bill at limits eminent domain power for companies looking to run CO2 pipelines in Iowa. This bill might not be awful, but I'm hesitant to give any credit because I doubt it'll stop anything that will benefit ethanol. Lawmakers at the State House introduced proposed constitutional amendment on Tuesday to ban gay marriage in Iowa. Sounds like it's not going anywhere, but it shows you where some Iowa Republicans are at. This week, a bill introduced at the State House with ban abortion in Iowa. It's called the Iowa Human Life Protection Act. It would penalize doctors and anyone who helps trying to get an abortion. It would also require internet providers to block Iowa's access to websites related to abortion care. A child labor bill got through with 16 to 17 year olds in Iowa could work in bars and sell or serve drinks. With parental permission, 15 year olds could perform light assembly work, provided it is not on a machine or in an area with machines, but somehow 14 year olds could work in meat lockers. In unrelated news, a new report from the Iowa Cancer Registry shows the state is protected to have the second highest incident rate of cancer cases in the country this year. Doesn't look like there's going to be any action taken on that though. I'll leave you with a quote from Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Confirst. If you were to look at this legislator's work, you would think the biggest problem facing our state is trans kids in gay marriage. Instead, the problems facing our state are rising cancer rates, our homeless kids, our schools at new additional help, our mental health crisis that I've heard about over and over.

He is charged with seven counts of essay against a child and one count of automisay. Remember your pig Latin for middle school. Helena Alabama Police Department started an investigation in December after a victim came forward with allegations of past abuse. That investigation went on for several months and a grand jury was presented with the information in August and handed down indictments. We're unsure how long Granger had been living in Florida but he was arrested in Panama City on fugitive from justice charges and will be extradited back to Alabama to face these charges.

@chayoeverett_video_7324459186773921070.txt," incarcerated workers in the US produce at least 11 billion in goods and services annually. Carcerated workers, by the way, typically earn little to no pay at all with many making just pennies an hour. How much does it cost to house an inmate? In 2020, state government spend a combined 55 billion on correction. You can see down here, Mississippi only spends around 18,000 and Wyoming spends about 135,000. Point is, if you take that 55 billion and cross-reference it to the 11 billion that inmates produce, yeah, you'll think it's very expensive to house an inmate. You'll see that there's a deficit in the amount of capital that inmates are producing and the amount that it costs to house them. However, this is where critical thinking and some connecting of the dots comes in. For instance, the prison phone industry, a market that's dominated by several large privately held firms that earn an estimated 1.2 billion per year. The private companies also offer state and local authorities a percentage of their revenue. Some jails have removed in-person family visitation rooms to make way for video visitation terminal, provided by private firms which can charge as much as $30 for 40 minutes of screen time. On prison phone companies, Securus Technologies says in its marketing materials that it has paid out 1.3 billion in these so-called commissions over the past 10 years. Horizon Health, one of the sponsors of the Louisiana Prison Trade Show, is the country's largest prison health care firm. It treats more than 300,000 prisoners nationwide earning about 1.4 billion in annual revenue. There's also the subject of numerous investigations in lawsuit. Many prisons and jails basic commissary items like cereal and canned soup can cost five times the retail price, as the country's inmate population has ballooned, so has revenue. Prison policy initiative estimates that the commissary companies earn 1.6 billion per year. There are just a few companies that are each earning billions of dollars a year off of the prison system. Again, if you look at this 11 billion number and cross-reference it with the 55 billion that it costs to house inmate, it looks like there's a deficit. But then when you consider all of the other companies and organizations that are involved and have hands in making money in the prison industry, begin to connect the dots and start to realize that it's very lucrative for a lot of different industries for people to be in prison. For example, Apple. A iPhone, Apple does not manufacture the screens, Apple does not make the batteries, does it make the camera sensors, Apple didn't even manufacture the processor. Long line of a bunch of different companies came together to make the iPhone and it is sold as an Apple device. Even though in the US there are public and private prisons, all prisons are basically private prisons. As even public prisons outsource a lot of the operations to third parties that are private businesses. Just looking at the revenue that is made by this state does not give you a full picture of the situation, it doesn't give you a full picture of all of the different industries that are involved in making the prison industry work. Is way more than just billions of dollars at play here? Take into account all the food vendors, all the cell phone communication companies. The fact that a lot of maintenance that's done to prisons, that a lot of people cite as being very expensive is done by prisoners and is done for no pay. We may never truly know the actual dollar amount of all of the free labor that prisoners are providing for America. For very obvious reasons. Just like how we may never know the true exact dollar amount of all of the free labor that was provided by Africans during slavery in America. Now it's a fuck ton of money. We also have a lot of reasons to believe that it's even a fuck ton more than the fuck ton we already know that it is. Point here is there is nothing but incentives for the government and corporations to work together, collude if you will, to lobby and change laws to make it so that more people end up in prison. To actually know the facts, it becomes quite obvious and clear, only that stuff like this will become common knowledge. So I would employ you to start doing some research, strengthening that muscle because it will be advantageous to you in the future.",subjective

And while I have to say that I was assayed or I was molested as a child, whenever I'm telling those stories, by the way, would you rather hear those stories than the word fuck? I mean, like, is the word fuck so offensive after I just told you that I got molested when I was 12 by a 40-year-old man? Really? I'm not putting your comments up here. I'm not going to send people to your page to hate on you. I'm not going to do any of that.

And you cannot tell a whole story in just three minutes. There's always more to every story. Trust me. The main thing for me is that I am not inhibited. Not here, not anywhere. My freedom of speech is important to me and I will express myself as I see fit when I see fit. I have well over a half a million followers on here and I haven't even been here a year yet.

Pramaya Jayapal's office put out a little statement, sort of, you know, like walking it back. We stand firmly with Ukraine. And then, just before the show, we now have a full on backpedaling. Here's how Glenn Greenwald features this. He says, holy shit, the humiliation of representative Jayapal in the House Progress of Caucus just got worse even when it appeared it couldn't. Her degrading reversal of their Ukraine letter after one day wasn't enough. Now they're formally, formally retracting it and blaming staff members. That's ridiculous. Yeah. Do the same people work at the end of the week. Hang on, hang on. So, so like, staff members of 30 Congress, like people got together and wrote this letter in the name of these, like, Congress, that is, that is an amazing lapse in security and judgment on somebody's part somewhere. Yes. That's true. Or they were pressured into it by their, you know, kind of kid junior lackeys. I mean, it was staff members fall. I mean, it's unbelievable. And so let me just read to you.

Representative Pramaya Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, issued the following statement in a letter sent regarding Ukraine. The Congressional Progressive Caucus hereby withdraws its recent letter to the White House regarding Ukraine. The letter was drafted several months ago. But unfortunately, it was released by staff members without vetting. So we're going to pick that apart in a second, right? Because I don't, I think that's total bullshit, don't you? As chair of the caucus, I accept responsibility for this. Because of the timing, our message is being conflated by some as being equivalent to the recent statement by Republican leader McCarthy threatening to end aid to Ukraine if Republicans take over. The proximity of these statements created the unfortunate appearance. The Democrats who have strongly and unanimously supported and voted for every package of military strategic and economic assistance to the Ukrainian people are somehow aligned with Republicans, who seek to pull the plug on American support for Zelensky and the Ukrainian forces.

He says 103 journalists who have been killed are not numbers. They are 103 voices that Israel has silenced. 103 fewer witnesses because of the catastrophe unfolding in Palestine. 103 lives extinguished.

We reiterate our urgent appeal to protect the journalists in Gaza. It's easy to get lost in the numbers, but here is Mohammed Abu Khatab. He was killed by an Israeli shelling on November 2nd, 2023.

Me, flea markets, cool shit, I'm in there. I go to this flea market in this very rural area in Indiana. Now this is deep red Indiana territory. It fits perfectly down there with Alabama and Mississippi. I walk in and I see it is a large crowd of older white people, 50 and up. They are looking at me like I just walked off of a UFO. As I'm walking around, I'm seeing a lot of Confederate flag themed memoravile. So with all these white people here, I said I'm going to buy one of these flags because I want to see what their reaction is to a black guy buying a Confederate flag. So I got it and I'm carrying it very visibly so everybody can see that I have it. And I definitely got their attention. I'm in line and this younger white dude says, man, I got to ask you why you buying the Confederate flag and I can tell he asked what a lot of people were wondering. So a lot of ears start to tune in and I asked him, what do you think I got it for? And he said hopefully to burn it or wipe your ass with it. I got a teammate. The room was full of people that were like his racist grandparents. He didn't like immediately after he says that a older white lady says that's so unpactriotic. Why would you want to be disrespectful to American heritage? And I'm like youngsters, stand down. I got this. Ma'am, you are right and you are completely wrong about something. You are right about the fact that it is American heritage, but it is a side of American heritage. And that side wanted to preserve the institution of slavery and felt that blacks were subhuman. So it is American heritage, but it is reflective of the team that you are playing on when it comes to American heritage. And what you are completely wrong about is the Confederacy is the most unpatriotic group of people in American history. Patriotism is loyalty to your country and the person chosen to run your country. In this case, Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the United States and the United States had chosen a direction and the Confederacy did not agree with that and wanted to succeed from the United States. They engaged in an act of war against the government. If the Confederates were patriots, they would have followed the direction that the country was going and the leader that was elected to run this country. What they did was they chose to pick up arms and go to war against the United States of America. That is the most treasonous, unpatriotic thing in American history. Then an older white guy chimes in and he says this, Why do you always blame America for slavery? slavery was in Africa. slavery was in Rome. Slavery existed a lot of other places outside of America. Youngster, they fucking with the wrong one. Sir, there is one ingredients in American slavery that made it completely different from any other form of slavery that existed on the planet before it. That ingredients was based on a pseudo sign saying that the people being subjugated were not even a part of the human race. They were not homo sapiens. They were subhuman. The people being enslaved were not even being considered human beings. Slavery and other places never had that element in Rome and Africa. The people being subjugated were not seen as not being human. It was based solely on might is right. I defeated you. You can't beat me. Go take care of my cattle. But the idea that Africans were not even humans made American slavery totally different. It was more dehumanizing than any other form of slavery that existed on the planet before. This is an American ingenuity. If I own you and you have a kid, I own your kid. And if your kid has a kid, I own that kid. I own your whole bloodline. It is an egregious miscalculation to equate slavery in Africa, slavery in Rome and what the fuck was going on in America. Then I heard this. I got a lot of those flags around my house and I don't understand why people get all in a tizzy about this. Okay, man. Let me ask you this. If we was in Germany and somebody was flying the little mustache guys flag and saying that it was a part of German heritage, do you think that would be right? It is a part of German heritage. I don't see why it would be disrespectful. Youngster, this bit super racist. She had a little boy with her and I asked her was that her grandson or something. She says yes, he was autistic.

When I talk to my conservative friends right here, they always tell me the problem is high taxes, that they are wrong. Of course, high taxes are extremely high here in the United States. I give you that. You're right in that. But that's not the real problem. The real problem is not the high taxes themselves, but the fact that they are not even really funding the government. But even those high taxes, higher than a lot of places in the world, but even those taxes are really funding the government. So who's finance in the government? Government is finance by Treasury bonds. And who buys the Treasury bonds? Mostly the Fed. And how does the Fed buy them? By printing money. But what back in does the Fed have? For that money being printed? The Treasury bonds themselves. So basically, you finance the government by printing money out of the air. Someone could ask, someone could ask, well, so if the government can print a limited amount of money out of the air, why did they collect taxes? I mean, if you will make sense, right, if they can print a limited amount of money, why would they need taxes? The answer is simple, but it's better shocking. The real problem is that you pay high taxes only to uphold the illusion that you are funding the government, which you are not. It's something that is true. The government is funded by money printing, paid for back with paper, a bubble that will inevitably burst. The situation is even worse than it seems, because it most Americans and the rest of the world were to become aware of this far. Confidence in your currency will be lost.

The impeachment of Secretary of May Orcas is designed to distract the public from the fact that Republicans have seeded their power to Donald Trump. When Republicans took control of the House of Representatives, they had an opportunity to work with the White House and the Senate to move the country forward. Instead, they have been consumed by petty infighting during multiple speaker contests, unenforced crisis over government shutdowns and feudal political exercises like impeachment to satisfy the extreme mega-base.

Again, we did not handle this right, and I did not handle it right. If we want to talk about what's going on in national security and the greatest threats in national security, it's not that the Secretary of Defense screwed up and is cleaning up the mess. I wouldn't equate my going to the hospital and receiving treatment. And being capacitated as a Secretary here, yes, is going AWOL. And back in December, I should have promptly informed the president, my team in Congress, and the American people of my cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment. Again, we did not handle this right, and I did not handle it right. As you know, I apologize, including directly to the president, and I take full responsibility. I want to again make one thing very clear. At no time during my treatment or recovery were there any gaps in authorities, and there were no risk to the department's command and control. And from the time that I resumed my duties on January 5th, I fully participated in national security decision making on events in the Middle East, and about military operations in self defense to protect our troops and our facilities over there. Secretary, the reason we've asked you here today is not to discuss your health. We're here today to determine why the president was not immediately informed of your incapacitation. The timeline as we understand it is this. On the evening of January 1st, Secretary Austin was transported to the hospital via ambulance for complications stemming from a surgical procedure he had on December 22nd. On the afternoon of January 2nd, the secretary's authorities were transferred to Deputy Secretary Hicks without her even being informed as to why. On January 4th, three days after the secretary's hospitalization, Deputy Secretary Hicks and the president were first informed that Secretary Austin was in the hospital. On January 5th, Congress is informed of the secretary's hospitalization. It's totally unacceptable that it took three days to inform the president of the United States that the secretary of defense was in the hospital and not in control of the Pentagon. Who will be held accountable for this embarrassment? Again, I take full responsibility and we put measures in place to address the shortcomings. Are you surprised the president didn't call for your resignation? I'm surprised, but are you surprised that he didn't call for your resignation? The president has expressed full faith in confidence in me. So you're not surprised that he didn't call for your resignation? Is it typical that the president would go three days without talking to his secretary of defense? Is that typical or is that a regular posture? Do you usually go days without talking to the commander in the office? I mean, that can happen. It depends on whether or not the president is on travel. If I'm on travel, there are times when we do go days without direct communication. So the big issue for me here is either the president is that aloof or you are irrelevant? Which one is it, Mr. Secretary? That you would go three days without knowing that his secretary of defense is not on the job. It's neither. The president is not aloof. Was there any time during this process in the first days of January when you were in the hospital? Any time whatsoever when the deputy secretary wasn't in a position to fully carry out the responsibilities of the secretary of defense? She is legally and logistically positioned to assume the functions and she was your right in a position to be able to support the president as chief of staff as he made decisions. So, commander in chief. So, she always has secure communications with her just like me. And she has a situational awareness that that's needed to be able to make effective recommendations to the president. She working with the chairman of the joint chiefs and also the combat commander would propose options for the president in any situation. You said something very important. You said there was never a break in command and control. But yet the president of the United States was not aware that you were outside of the chain of the command. So, is the president not a part of this command and control? Don't you believe that the commander in chief and the sect of that is critical for command and control? He is clearly at the top of the chain in terms of command and control. But what's important is that we provide him with credible options that he can pursue to address any situation. And it would have happened in this case because... Except he was unaware. So, what's important is the president was unaware of this breakdown and command and control. And you were not there in terms of who he would come from. Hillary, I'm just sorry. What prevented you at that initial hospitalization, which was a planned procedure from telling the president, albeit privately, about your condition that you had cancer? As I said, you know, diagnosis of cancer is a very personal and deeply troubling issue. And it's one that quite frankly, you know, I described it as a gut punch. And again, I didn't want to burden the president with one of my personal issues. But I've also said that I didn't get this right. I should have informed him. I should have talked to him about it. And I have since talked to the president. I have apologized. And he responded with a warmth and empathy that anybody knows you'll buy. I have limited time. I'm sorry. You, I don't mean to be rude. You said you, or you just said you expect your organization in early questioning to do the right thing and notify higher. But when you initially went in, it was not your intent or expectation to notify higher. You didn't expect your organization to notify the president, correct? You know, as I said, I didn't get that right. And I, that was not done appropriately. I appreciate that, that canter. But just, just so I have clarity, your initial intent was to go in, have the procedure for there to be not any complications in the White House would be none the wiser in the process, correct? We, we, we didn't, I didn't instruct anybody to notify anyone. That's right. I will note that while we are spending our precious time, at least I think it's precious. On taking you and the administration to task, we are failing in our responsibility to fund the Department of Defense. We're now five months late in the appropriation process. It is the responsibility of the Congress to provide the appropriations and we are not doing so. We're on our fourth or fifth continuing resolution. We are derelict, not usur. It is the Congress of the United States and the leadership in this house that is failing to meet the national security needs of this nation. In the appropriation process, October, November, December, January and February have passed. And we've not done our work. And we're spending our time here taking you to task. That's wrong. We're failing. When a soldier goes AWOL, when they wear the uniform, when they put their lives on the line for our nation for you, what happens when they go AWOL? What is the punishment? I wouldn't equate my going to the hospital and receiving treatment. Being capacitated as a secretary here, yes, is going AWOL. So you don't equate. Disappearing being incapacitated with being AWOL. I didn't disappear. I was in a military hospital. You didn't tell your secretary. You just testified. You didn't tell your staff. Did you not? You just testified. What happens when a soldier goes AWOL? I have 20 seconds. What happens when they go AWOL? We have to realize that I have a fairly large, or they honorably are disonably discharged. They put into the break. What happens? Seriously, you're not even answering the questions. I'm not going to rest until someone we should not rest until someone is held accountable. Look, you made a mistake. You admitted it. You're taking steps to address it. And you want to know what accountability is. Accountability is having to come and sit in front of people and their outrage and their drama in public about your health issues. And the mistakes you've admitted you made when the entire world is wondering what the hell is going on with the United States of America. So, if we want to talk about what's going on in national security and the greatest threat to national security, it's not that the Secretary of Defense screwed up and is cleaning up the mess. The greatest threat to national security is the polarization of the country and the fact that we can't explain to the world who we are and what kind of leadership role we want.

@daiquiriheiress_video_7345603542972960042.txt," This is from the American Civil Liberties Union. This is a document entitled Prison Conditions and Prisoner Abuse after Katrina, and the document date is December 14, 2005. Katrina hit August 29, 2005. The Orleans Parish Prison fell into chaos five days after Hurricane Katrina stuck New Orleans on August 29. As the water rose in the prison buildings, deputies deserted on mass, leaving behind prisoners and locked cells. These prisoners spent days without power, food or water, some standing in sewage-tainted water up to their chests are next. Mind you, some of these people were not yet convicted. Like they were still waiting to go to trial, by the way, to put some more things into context for you, right? The ACLU said that more than 1,000 testimonials it has obtained from prisoners contradict public statements made by Sheriff Marlin and Gusman that the prisoners had food and water and that the evacuation went as planned. Some prisoners claim that deputies forced them into their selves by shooting beanbags, macing, and tasering them. Once they were returned to their selves, some deputies handcuffed the cell doors to prevent them from opening and escaping. As the locked cells begin to flood, prisoners hung signs out of broken windows for help, and others jumped into the water below. According to the testimonials, deputies and members of the Special Investigation Division shot at some of the prisoners who were attempting to escape the rising water inside the jail. Several prisoners report that they witnessed fellow prisoners getting shot in the back. When the prisoners were finally evacuated from the jail, many were forced to wade through toxic waste-filled water over to the Broad Street Interpass on Interstate 10. To go over the interstate, because I'd like to show you a picture of how you couldn't fucking get out of Louisiana during Katrina. This is the interstate. In and out. In and out. Let's go back here. While the prisoners were evacuated from jail, prisoners reported that the armed guards at the Overpass had K-9 dogs, which were used to threaten them and that they were maced and beaten. Female prisoners also report that deputies directed degrading and sexually offensive comments at them. In August 2006, one year after Katrina, the ACLU's National Prison Project released abandoned and abused Orleans Parish Prisoners in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The report documents the experience of thousands of men, women, and children in the Orleans Parish Prison in the days after this storm. In response to reports that hundreds of prisoners have returned to the Orleans Parish Prison, and this again 2005, or excuse me 2006, in response to hundreds of prisoners have returned to Orleans Parish Prison, the ACLU urged the City Council to conduct a full and thorough review of the conditions within the facility. In letters to each council member, the ACLU expressed concern that Sheriff Gusman reopened the prison despite the lack of adequate evacuation plans or medical staff and equipment. These are a couple of quotes from inmates who are not named, they're a number. These are just a few of them. The water was nasty and all black and dirty and all type of debris, even human waste. The deputy we thought would help burst in spring mace. People were dead from starving, from not eating or drinking. The water was so deep I had small prisoners holding on to me. We were called bitches and whores and we weren't moved until Monday night after the storm passed. I saw an old man being attacked by police canines simply because he got up to stretch. I waited through water that was filled with sewage up to my neck. I even saw one man who was hog tied, maced and bitten by a canine and they said, be glad that you're not dead. You're lucky we came and got y'all.",subjective

The letter was a very carefully drawn, mild letter that was very important because there had not been an official congressional statement urging the Biden administration to call for diplomacy.

@dianaw2018_video_7330126125441633579.txt," House Republicans are about to move forward with an impeachment resolution, but it's not an impeachment of President Biden. A meeting has been going on all day today of the House Homeland Security Committee. Lawmakers are preparing to take a final vote late tonight and if that vote is successful, which it's expected to be. Articles of impeachment for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorquez will be referred to the full House of Representatives for high crimes and misdemeanors. This is the first time in almost 150 years that the House has tried to remove a member of the president's cabinet through impeachment and wait till you hear the story of the last guy that went through it. He's a real peach. I'm gonna tell you about him in a second. But first, let's talk about Mayorquez. You may be wondering, what crimes or misdemeanors has he actually committed? Well, according to the draft articles of impeachment, Mayorquez will fully and systematically refuse to comply with federal immigration laws and he's guilty of breach of public trust by knowingly making false statements to Congress and obstructing the oversight of his department. Republican say Mayorquez is responsible for the chaos happening at the U.S. Mexico border and hasn't been following the laws. Secretary Mayorquez has testified in front of this very House committee several times and it's been, let's just say heated. Today, ahead of the committee's meeting, Mayorquez fired off this scathing six-page letter where he pushes back on the committee's claim that he's not enforcing immigration laws. He says that is false. He goes on to say this administration has actually removed or returned or expelled more migrants in three years than the prior administration did in four years. Then he lists all the actions the Homeland Security Department has taken at the border and all the actual numbers of migrant expulsions. His letter acknowledges that, yeah, the immigration system is broken, but Mayorquez says the only way to fix it is for Congress to pass some new legislation. He then goes on to say he's been working with that bipartisan group of senators to do just that. He's been part of that big border deal that I told you about in this video. It's a deal that the House speaker has said, even if it does pass the Senate, it's dead on arrival in the House. Republicans are now saying no new legislation is needed to correct what's happening at the border. So now what? Well, the committee will take a vote tonight to move the impeachment articles for Secretary Alejandro Mayorquez forward. Then it will go to the full House for a vote in the coming weeks, whether it will pass the House is a whole different story. So yeah, Republicans have the majority in the House, but as I told you in this video, because of the Republicans who are no longer in their seats, the House GOP has only a two vote margin. Obviously, no Democrats are going to vote for the impeachment of Alejandro Mayorquez. That means the House speaker can only lose two Republicans to no votes if he really wants this impeachment to pass. That is going to be tough. And even if it does somehow pass the House, the Senate will never convict him. Oh, and by the way, this is going to take weeks, weeks spent on this instead of other work. But if the Republicans are successful in this impeachment, it would be the first time in almost 150 years a cabinet secretary has been impeached. Now, this is the story I've been waiting to tell you. The last time this happened was May of 1876 when William Belknapp then wore Secretary for President Ulysses Grant was impeached by the House for corruption, apparently. He received $20,000 in kickbacks from a traitor that he awarded a government contract to. So how did Congress figure it out? Well, apparently, Belknapp wasn't hiding it. He loved to show off his wealth at parties he was hosting in Washington and both his first and second wives loved the luxury items. And we're always dressed to the nines. And people started to wonder how the hell was Belknapp affording such a lavish lifestyle and is $8,000 a year government salary. In the end, the Senate failed to convict Belknapp of the impeachment. So he was impeached by the House, but not convicted in the Senate. He was acquitted and he was not prosecuted any further.",subjective

@dr.sandstorm_video_7338132138178415915.txt," Well, this should give you a chuckle or two. In today's issue of pink news, it's featured that a Canadian family moved to Russia to escape wokeness and LGBTQ people, and it didn't go well. Weird. The YouTuber patriarch of the right-wing Canadian family, Aaron Feonstra, decided that he'd had enough of gay people existing in his country. So he decided to take his family to Russia instead. He said that they did not feel safe for their children in Canada and their children's future anymore. He's an avowedly Christian dad of eight. But there were a few little details that the Feonstras forgot to work out before they moved to Russia to get away from gay people, such as learning Russian, because once they got there, and Neesa Feonstra was faced with trying to choose which bathroom to use and didn't speak Russian. And of course in Russia, you have to use the bathroom for the sex that you were assigned to at birth. And she said, I needed to use the washroom, and on the doors it said male and female, but I didn't know which was which. In America, that wouldn't be a problem. It's a free-for-all in the bathrooms. And then there was the fact that they failed to find out whether or not their credit cards would work in Russia, which they don't. And then the fact that they plunked a large sum of cash into a Russian bank account that was subsequently seized by the Russian government because of the possibility of money laundering. This caused Neesa to throw a fairly large temper tantrum on their YouTube, criticizing the Russian government pretty heavily. And who would have thought that a government that does not allow people to express themselves in their sexual orientation or their sexual identification would actually not allow you to criticize the government openly? So this caused their Russian handlers to sort of wrap them on the knuckles according to this article. And they pulled back their criticism of the government and said, no, we're not frustrated with the government. We're just frustrated with ourselves here in this country. So now all 10 of the family members are living in a two-room apartment because all of their money was frozen in a bank account by the Russian government. They can't use their visa or their master card or any of that. And they don't have the funds to buy the farm that they had hoped to buy. And they don't speak Russian.

In case you're unfamiliar, Liberty University is by far the biggest and most influential Christian college in the nation. It was founded by the famous pastor Jerry Falwell and has grown to be one of the most prominent Christian organizations in the country. The Clary Act is a law that requires colleges and universities that receive federal funding to collect data on campus crime and notify students of threats. Schools must disseminate an annual security report that includes crime reports and information to improve campus safety. And as the article says, Liberty has marketed itself for years as having one of the safest campuses in the nation with 15,000 students enrolled in the school in Lynchburg. Its police department had one single officer with little to no oversight investigating all crimes for just under a decade for 15,000 students plus residents plus faculty. And the U.S. Department of Education said it identified numerous cases that resulted in misclassification or underreporting of crimes. Instead of just underreporting crimes or trying to hide sexual crimes, many victims of sexual crimes feared reporting because of concerns of reprisal. The final program review stated several were punished for violating the student cone of conduct known as the Liberty Way while there are salents were left unpunished. There's a story up here. I'm not going to get into too much of the details up, but it's it's basically that, but I'm not going to read it for you here on TikTok. It's a little nasty. Consequently, many victims of sexual assault felt dissuaded by Liberty administration's reputation for punishing sexual assault survivors rather than helping them. Such fears created a culture of silence where sexual assaults commonly went unreported at Liberty University. Liberty University has admitted some fault here, paying the fines, they're cooperating, they're trying to clean this up. And I think one of the main reasons they're doing that is because they don't want the university to get a bad reputation. If a Christian college gets a reputation for being a rape school, it's going to completely implode. However, they're also dealing with issues above lawsuits by former students and employees who accuse the school of all of these things. And they just recently settled a civil suit with 12 women after they accused the school of fostering an unsafe environment and mishandling cases of sexual assault. So yeah, the the private Christian University at Lynchburg, Virginia, maybe not the safest campus to go to.",subjective
@duanaq17_video_7155534110562307374.txt," Democrats sent the rules. You can recall what Democrats said back in the time when and the details are thus Donald Trump simply asked Ukraine and the president of Ukraine to look in to the Biden family corruption. A series of events that looks like extortion withholding aid to an ally and then quote-unquote asking for a favor to essentially benefit yourself politically. The bride is to pledge or withhold military assistance. The idea that somebody would withhold in badly needed weaponry for political reasons at home is beyond the tale. Now of course what was Donald Trump asking them to look into? He was asking them to look into situations like this where Joe Biden openly stated on camera that he used American taxpayer dollars in order to protect his son hunter from being investigated by Ukrainian special prosecutor. Here is Joe Biden on tape using a billion dollar blackmail against the government of Ukraine and he was proud of it. He got applauded for it. It's a son of a bitch. They fired the prosecutor go. I said no I said I'm not going to give you the billion dollars. They said you have no authority you're not the president. The president said I said call him. I said I'm telling you not get the billion dollars. I said you're not getting the billion dollars. I'm going to be leaving here and I think it was about six hours. I look at it and I said we even six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired you're not getting the money. Well son of a bitch. He fired. They put in place someone who was solid. I didn't know that this is all because of Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine. Hunter Biden demanded that Joe Biden do this and Joe Biden do tofully went down and protected his crack as he always does. So the question is how long will Joe Biden remain protected? This is the clearest example in my lifetime. By the way, Donald Trump didn't withhold any spending or funding from Ukraine. Donald Trump didn't withhold anything. Ukraine decided not to open up an investigation into the Biden's hilarious. And now of course we see what's happening at that region of the world. Of course the calamity and the collapse all stemming obviously from horrible and poor political decisions would have been a lot smarter to stick with the president to brought you peace.

It's always been a bad route to take to be in league with people who are warmongers. Okay. This is why Tulsi Gabbard left the Democratic Party this week warmongers. But hey, I didn't make the decisions. You probably should have investigated Joe Biden. If someone's get announced that he was going to investigate Joe Biden and went after and prosecuted Hunter Biden and his son. Would we be in the world we're living in today? But he chose to side with the Biden's so whatever. Okay. Listen, we're sitting here. It's looking at this situation saying this is the clearest cut could pro quo we've ever seen in our life.

To reach that type of educated creative workforce at South by, we needed to compete for attention with consumer facing brands that often spent millions to launch their products or TV shows. I thought we could get noticed by giving away cool swag alongside the report, and my idea was branded socks. We spent some time debating the color of the socks, the logo, and just how many to order. And just before finalizing the plan, a young woman in my team came in and asked if she could speak to me privately. She confided, Alex, you know women don't really wear crew socks. I asked, well, what do they wear? And she responded, ankle socks. It never occurred to me to order any other kind of socks than the kind that I was familiar with. Her suggestion had merit and we ended up ordering half ankle and half crew socks. Of course, the socks were a hit. But what was telling was that demand for the ankle socks by both women and men was higher than for the crew socks and substantially so. Our entire project was more effective because a woman on my team was comfortable sharing her perspective with a pretty opinionated mailbox and that I was open to that input.

@enepy_englishta_video_7304065600790220074.txt," So today I thought it'd be interesting to talk about the US government, how it works, and how it's laid out in the US Constitution. So for starters, the US government is divided by three branches. First, you have legislative, executive, and in the judicial. And within the three, they have something that's called checks and balances. So pretty much what that means is that every branch has the power and the ability to check on another branch to make sure no one's abusing their power. So the executive branch consists of the president, their cabinet, and various government agencies. But when most people think of the executive branch, they're only thinking of the president. So the president, they're elected by the Electoral College. They serve a maximum of two terms, each term being four years each. And their job is to carry and enforce laws in the United States. And in here we have our legislative branch, which is made up of Congress, which is actually divided by two chambers, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate is the smaller of the two chambers, which every state getting two senators each, totally enough to 100 senators, and a term for a senator is only six years, but they can be re-elected as many times as they want. And the House of Representatives is the bigger of the two chambers, which are total of 435 members, and each state gets a number of members that's proportional to their state size. So for example, California gets more House of Rep members than Virginia because more people living in California than in Virginia. A House of Rep members serves a term of two years, but like the senators, they can be re-elected as many times as they want. And together as Congress, their job is to write and pass laws in the United States. They have the power to check both the president and the judicial branch. And fun fact, they are the only branch that has the power to declare war in the United States. And then the last branch is the judicial branch. I have a hard time saying that word. And that refers to all of the courts in the United States, but the most powerful and the most important one is the Supreme Court. And here the Supreme Court consists of nine justices or judges, and each one is appointed by the president, but once they're appointed, they serve for life. And their main role is to interpret the laws, and they check the other branches by making sure that the laws that are passed by Congress, or any policies that are proposed by the president are constitutional. And therefore legal in the United States. And this is a simple but simple overview of the US government.

But there are limits because of the importance of maintaining an orderly learning environment. Your school can prohibit speech that's disruptive or interferes with the rights of others. For example, your speech or expression might be something that's only okay. But if it interferes with your classmates right to an education, you probably can't do it.

So if you're interested in learning more about that, watch the rest of this video. And don't forget visit us at Findlot.com to learn more. If you attend public school you generally have the same free speech rights as anyone else when it comes to what you say, right, where or how you otherwise express yourself. But there are limits because of the importance of maintaining an orderly learning environment. Your school can prohibit speech that's disruptive or interferes with the rights of others, such as speech that is vulgar or offensive. Thus a Supreme Court has even ruled that schools can prevent speech that it deems inappropriate. Before wearing a shirt that may seem disruptive, consider the following.

@fizzahrazaphotography_video_7310084751983938858.txt," Hey guys, I was just reading something online that I really wanted to share. I ran into this article called Two Dangerous Bills in Congress Tick Aim at Palestine Solidarity and it's on this website called MondoWice.net and their byline basically says there are news and opinions about Palestine, Israel and the United States. So I'm gonna be reading it so I'm probably not gonna be making any eye contact with my phone. Anyways, a first part of it goes over that bill that equated anti-zainism and anti-semitism. And when that was going through, like my initially I thought like this is what our Congress is spending time on right now like definitions and semantics. But then I remember thinking like this kind of weird like there's got to be a reason for this beyond like what is the obvious reason and I feel like we've seen in the past these patterns where like these smaller bills kind of lead up to bigger things and they because they use these as like references. If I'm not making a whole lot of sense or if I'm just kind of extra it's just been a very long day and I'm definitely a little bit messed up from seeing the footage that came out today of the men Palestinian men being round up and blindfolded. So anyways one of the things that was interesting was when they're talking about this bill that basically was saying anything anti-zainism is anti-semitic. One thing that passed I was one thing that they said that was interesting is that only the day before democratic rep, Jerry Nadler of New York who is a staunch supporter of Israel and a pillar of the American Jewish community made a speech on the House floor clarifying that anti-zainism is a position that Jews have held as long as some of their fellows have embraced Zionism. He noted but the religious objections including that of the largest Hatsidic sect in the world the Sathomar as well as a long tradition of labor activists and others that could reduce who had and have political objections to Zionism. However when the bill did come up for vote Nadler like 91 other Democrats voted present on the bill. So I know apparently 95 Democrats voted yes only 13 Democrats voted no. So anyways the whole point of the bill was defining anti-zainism as anti-semitism but this is now setting it up for another bill okay so let me get to that part. So this bill is HR 6578 and it is titled quote to establish the Commission to study acts of anti-semitism in the United States and here's another quote attributed to Lara Friedman says the intention of the bill is quote exclusively to target criticism of Israel and Zionism. This is clear from the where-as clauses which are 100% about October 7th and its aftermath and from the press release. So it says there is already a well-known presidential initiative to combat anti-semitism that was presented with great fanfare and widespread approval. The bill itself makes no mention of the white nationalism that is a source of the overwhelming majority of anti-semitism but focuses exclusively on incidents since October. Both the bill itself and the comments in the press release that announced a focus entirely on support for Palestinians as anti-semitism. So it's ignoring like white supremacy groups and such it is focused on anyone who's propostive. Then it goes on to say in case it goes any doubt about the legitimacy of this Commission Congress hopes to create a clause in the bill that bars any witness a peanut for the commission from invoking their fifth amendment right to avoid self-incomination. That is particularly problematic in an atmosphere where criticism of Israel is corining toward being categorized as hate speech. Anti-semitism in this bill is defined even more loosely than the one in the House passed Tuesday. So in this act of the term anti-semitism means a certain perception of Jews which may be expressed as and then it defines these in these qualities. So number one is hatred towards Jews and two by rhetorical and physical manifestations directed to where and then has these subcategories. Jewish or non-Jewish individuals or the property of the individual is described under subparagraph A or Jewish community institutions or Jewish religious facilities. So now this whole thing where it says a certain perception of Jews is white open to interpretation. Then include the inclusion of non-Jewish individuals, white and the scope potentially to include Christian signage or other non-Jewish supporters of Israel. Rept, so I'm still reading this Rep Debbie Wasserman Schultz, one of the Democratic co-sponsors of the bill said Democratic co-sponsors of the bill said quote is by partisan by camera inquiry which is supported by Jewish civil society leaders and experts will complement the implementation of President Biden's first ever national strategy to counter anti-semitism and inform key policy decisions, policy decisions in combating this disturbing trend. By quote Jewish civil society unquote she means a pack in the ADL, both of which are enthusiastic supporters of this bill. The commission is hauntingly reminiscent of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Sorry I got caught off. The commission is hauntingly reminiscent of the House Un-American Activities Committee that Senator Joe McCarthy used to destroy so many lives including a massive number of Jewish leftists. As Friedman said ADL is all-in supporting promoting the New Hatchan which would seek to destroy the lives of Americans who dared to criticize Israel including Jewish Americans. The question quote are you now or have you ever been a supporter of Palestinian rights? Un- quote may well come to Hanth American history just as McCarthy did. I'm gonna post the link to this article in the comments but I just wanted to share this because I don't know everything just seems to be headed in the wrong direction and keeps heading. I feel like we're on this like speed train that's going downhill and I don't know how to stop it except do the things that we've been doing because it's not just about Palestine because it's about all these other things and it frustrates me to know and that there are people who do not see how it affects Americans here. So anyways I wanted to share that one because I haven't I think I saw one other chick talk share this and this kind of got me thinking about a lot of things and wanted to share.

Well, just personally, I was really extremely disappointed. And it's I guess a bit strange to be continually disappointed by Kanye West, but I didn't hear about it since until Sunday morning when the brother of George Floyd Clownis gave me a call and said, he was I ring. He was extremely hurt by the statements that Kanye West made. I had to go look up the interview and see that he was now blame in a drug overdose and a theory that was well debunked in court as you all pointed out, something that is clearly not the reason that George Floyd died. He died as a a bearish chauvin's knee and the other officers compressing his body in a prone position. And now he's promulgating those statements are new in a way that is it almost seemed designed to cause the family distress. And so they reached out to me specifically his brother and asked that we again investigate whether or not we can restrain him from making such statements and hold him accountable for the misinformation that he's putting out there. How serious are they about doing something against Kanye West? I know that Clownis Floyd, for example, was bothered that I said we were considering lawsuit. He is absolutely committed to bringing lawsuit and I've heard from other members of the family who are represented by various parties saying that they are absolutely 100% moving forward with litigation against Kanye West and anyone else who would defend George Floyd in his reputation. Part of what makes this so upsetting for the family is that after George was murdered Kanye West was one of many people celebrities who reached out and I believe he even made a donation to pay for George's daughter's college tuition. So I know there was some appreciation that was expressed by the family back then and then now to hear him saying things like this. You know that that actually did come up in the conversation I had with Clownis. A part of the conversation was one of the Cooper Jones, a mod Arbiter's mother and those families that Floyd family and the Arbiter family are friends and when this kind of injury takes place when someone undermines their movement they support each other. The two of them called me together and they said that they saw Kanye West as a friend and that's why this was personal for them that it wasn't just some random person who isn't had an action family who didn't know them so far as supportive and made this thing but this was someone who was awfully supportive in the past which almost legitimizes his extreme views and you know they've asked that with that in mind that we pursue litigation against Kanye.",subjective

@gaiapall_video_7251281240051977514.txt," Another youth climate lawsuit that was filed almost seven years ago against the United States government is now awaiting trial. We just talked about the first climate case to get a trial in the United States. Now we're talking about the first climate case to get a trial on a federal level, which is huge, and I don't understand why people aren't talking about this again. Before getting into the bumpy timeline of Juliana versus the US government, it's worth being noted that this is not just an active case, but this is a case that's being actively attacked by the US DOJ. We haven't been talking about it, so let's talk about it now. The Juliana versus US government court case. This case was filed all the way back in 2015 when it was filed and the US District Court in Oregon. The case claims that the United States government is violating the youth's right to life, liberty, and property, as well as failing to protect essential public trust resources. I didn't mention this in my previous videos, but these cases come with what's called a statement of facts, and they explicitly call out exactly how the government puts its people and its resources in danger through false-of-field pollution. Hereafter, this case was filed in Oregon. The false-of-field industry joined the US government as a defendant on the case, essentially trying to dismiss the case alongside the government. A district court judge denied this request, and a few months later, a judge ordered that the false-of-field industry be taken off as defendants on the case. A trial date was then set for February of 2018. Not even a month after the trial date was set, the Trump administration requested for the case to be dismissed through a method called the Ritz of Mandamus. This is essentially a request that a higher court, bells a lower court to cut it out. This is typically a very extreme request, and it required that the court of appeals suspend the case temporarily to review this request. After hearing responses from the youth group and from the district court that was managing this case, and from expert organizations around the world that submitted briefs in support of the youth plaintiffs, they decided to deny the US government of this request. The following month, a new date was set for October of 2018 for the trial to start. The government then requests for a protective order, which prevents the disclosure of sensitive information except to certain individuals under certain circumstances. I wonder why. After this request was denied, the US government filed another Ritz of Mandamus petition. The US Supreme Court unanimously decides to reject this request, as well as rejecting the request from the government to see all the evidence and facts that the youth group was going to present before the district court heard it. The US government filed another motion to halt discovery and filed another Ritz of Mandamus. Now that this is the third Ritz of Mandamus, the Supreme Court halts the case temporarily to review it. A few weeks later, it was when the trial was supposed to go on, but it was suspended. So instead, thousands of Americans came out in support from all across the country to stand at the courthouse in support of the youth group. So the timeline between 2018 and October to June 2023 of this year is a whole bunch of legal pinplung, which I don't really think is relevant to the state of the case today. So I'll just say that I commend the youth group and their attorneys and the organization supporting them because that's a headache and a half. So I'll ask forward to this year, June of 2023, when a judge grants the youth group's request to have the trial go forward. Knowing that this trial was in danger of petition of over 250 organizations and more than 50,000 individuals signed and sent to the DOJ to let this case go forward. And only 11 days ago did the DOJ request for this case to be dismissed. So now we're waiting to hear what the response to the DOJ's request is, as well as when the trial date would actually start. We should get more answers within the next few weeks, but right now the youth group is asking for anyone who can or anyone who cares to tweet, email or if you're feeling chatty, call the DOJ and ask that the attorney general let the case go through. I'll be keeping close watch on this and we'll let you know as soon as we hear more.",subjective

On December 29, 1845, Texas became the 28th state in the United States. Formerly part of Mexico, Texas had been its own independent country since 1836. But soon after it became a state, it broke off with 10 other states to become the Confederacy. Despite Texas being so large, we all know how that war went. Over its history, Texas has had multiple flags flowing over it. Spain, France, Mexico, Republic of Texas, the United States, and the Confederacy.

The Confederacy was formed response to the election of President Abraham Lincoln, who has seen as a threat to the institution of slavery. The Confederate States of America, also known as the Confederacy or the South, was headed by President Jefferson Davis and had to own Constitution, flag, and even its own state capital, which was Richmond Virginia. The Confederacy was defeated in 1865 and the Southern states were re-admitted into the United States after agreeing to several concessions, including the abolition of slavery.",subjective
@hdsj1359ipe_video_7257055754673196330.txt," A recent and far-reaching event in the United States was the storming of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. The incident happened near the end of the Trump presidency, when pro-Trump protesters stormed the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. They are trying to prevent Congress from formally certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election, claiming that the vote was raped. The attack led to an emergency shutdown of Congress, the evacuation of lawmakers and congressional staff, and some injuries and even deaths. The incident shocked the world and highlighted political divisions and social unrest within the United States. The event had a major impact on the United States. First, it raises concerns about democracy, the rule of law, and the integrity of elections. The international community questioned America's democratic image and denounced the attack on the Capitol as a threat to democratic values. Second, shocks have further exacerbated political divisions. Various parties have different interpretations and responses to the incident, which has intensified the atmosphere of political confrontation and confrontation. President Trump was impeached a second time by the U.S. House of Representatives for encouraging violent insurrection. Third, the incident raises questions about America's domestic security and policing system. Investigations were launched into failures to protect the parliament building and discussions on police reform and enhanced security measures were prompted. Finally, the shocks have also galvanized global attention to the problem of extremism. Many countries face similar challenges of extremism and the experience of the United States serves as a case study for other countries and the international community to think about how to respond to and prevent extremism. The storming of the U.S. Capitol revealed the profound problems facing American politics and society, which will continue to influence and shape the direction and future of the United States.",subjective

American colonists disguise themselves as Mohawk Indians to protest the British East India Company's monopoly and heavy tax on tea by throwing out 342 chests of tea into the harbor. The coerced acts. Right after the protest, Britain was pissed. To punish the residents of Boston, they issued the coercive acts, which closed the ports and made the Bostonians pay for the tea that was thrown. That's like $1.7 million. Because of this, public opinion grew and paid the way for the rise of the revolution. Most Americans were pretty shocked about what Boston had done. George Washington was actually one of the many who wrote letters to apologize and make amends for what happened. Ben Franklin offered to pay for the damages. Ben Franklin offered to pay for the damages caused by the Boston Tea Party under one condition that the Brits reopen Boston Harbor. But the Brits refused. No one was actually punished for what happened. There was a strict code of secrecy surrounding the events of the Boston Tea Party, and as a result, no one ever identified who the participants were.

@hypohystericalhistory_video_7032024256317771010.txt," So do movements like Antifa and Black Lives Matter, do they make it harder for the West to defend itself against China or Russia? So well there's lots to talk about here man. So firstly I'll say is really this is a US problem rather than a problem with the West. So but because the US is an important problem, it is an important country within the West, therefore I guess it does make it everyone's problem. Secondly, don't lump Antifa in with Black Lives Matter as if they're the same thing. They're simply not. Just a Fox News Talking Point. So the vast majority of people who acted in the name with the Black Lives Matter movement were doing nothing more than peacefully protesting racial injustice within their society. There is nothing negative about that. There just isn't. That's a purely positive thing. It's a beautiful thing. It's one of the things that we're lucky enough to be able to do in our country, in our democracies, is protest to bring attention to an issue we think needs more attention. There's nothing bad about that. The riots were bad, but I think we really should separate the peaceful protests from the non-peaceful protests. Antifa are something different. Antifa are essentially fascists themselves, ironically. Basically they undermine the fabric of democracy by basically saying they'll use violence to stymie the political views of other people simply because they deem those views to be fascist, which is a fascist trait, ironically enough. So yeah, they're a problem. But look, man, don't pretend that this issue only exists on the left side of politics. The issues on the right are every bit as bad as Antifa, the proud boys, the oath keepers, new Nazi organisations, all of those tools who saw them the capital on January the 6th, every bit as bad as Antifa, potentially even worse. It's funny when I engage with Americans on here. It really seems that most of the time they see themselves as Republicans or Democrats first and Americans second. And that attitude actually is a strategic weakness. That is a vulnerability that hostile powers can exploit. We actually saw Russia do that during the Trump presidency. I don't know how effective they were, but they certainly tried. So you know, like just as a general thing, why is this a strategic weakness? Well, whenever a country becomes fixated on its own internal problems, it's able to do less internationally. And if those internal problems become critical, you know, and up in a civil war, absolutely that country becomes weaker. And whatever great power you want to look at through history that had deep internal problems, whenever they go through these internal issues, they simply become a less capable international actor. Not because they're less strong, aggregately, but because they're more focused on internal affairs. So the dysfunction in US politics itself is a geostrategic weakness, I would say, yes.",subjective

And to be honest, I think that the media in particular, but pretty much everybody looking at these texts are looking at the wrong thing because everything else we already knew. We already knew that people are crazy. We already knew that a lot of these politicians are believing in these ridiculous conspiracy theories that have no basis, no evidence. You could even see some of them grasping at even further stretching conspiracy theories. You know, like maybe it was China, maybe it was this, maybe it was that. But I mean, we already knew that. Everybody's saying that that's the shocking part. To me, what's new is how much malice was proven in those texts. The aftermath texts. Like the During the January 6th texts, the aftermath texts, where people were texting Mark Meadows and asking him, we should spin it like this. We should spin it like that. We should spin it like this. There was an active cover up going on, which proves malice. It proves the intent of what they wanted to do. It also proves motive. It proves they actually wanted it to happen the way they tried to make it happen. And they knew what they were doing was wrong. It proves malice and motive.

And particularly when you're talking about rich people with very expensive lawyers and politicians trying to prove corruption, that the hardest things to do and why a lot of these people don't get charged because a lot of these laws have attached to it and malice, intent, motive, things that are very difficult to prove. These texts do that. They prove intent. They prove motive. They prove malice. So this is the smoking gun. This is what was very difficult legally to charge people with. And I'm pretty sure the Department of Justice has already had these texts, which is why those specific texts were kind of kept in the background. We know January 6 had those texts. The aftermath of their attempt to spin and cover up what their involvement in January 6 was proves that hard part of the law. Now the question is, is will they have the balls?

We saw this recently with Screamstar Melissa Barara, and I agree, like I really think this is the closest we'll ever get to the fucking red scare.

Like, everything is online. And right now, the majority of the world is on Palestine's side. That's because people are seeing the facts, information, and proof via social media.

In order for the federal government to operate, there has to be a federal budget. This makes sure that the services that we all use continue to operate and that federal staff gets their paychecks. Now the budget process happens every year. And if Congress can't come together on an agreement for the next year's budget, the government shuts down. Here's why that's important right now. The last day for the current budget that we're under right now ends at the end of the month. And we're not even close to a deal for the next one. Now, there's a reason for this.

@its.nonna.page_video_7138305393629105454.txt," Imagine that one day, you're summoned before a government panel. Even though you haven't committed any crime or been formally charged with one, you are repeatedly questioned about your political views, accused of disloyalty, and asked to incriminate your friends and associates. If you don't cooperate, you risk jail or losing your job. This is exactly what happened in the United States in the 1950s, as part of a campaign to expose suspected communists. Named after its most notorious practitioner, the phenomenon known as McCarthyism destroyed thousands of lives and careers. For over a decade, American political leaders trampled democratic freedoms in the name of protecting them. During the 1930s and 1940s, there had been an active but small communist party in the United States. Its record was mixed. While it played crucial roles in wider progressive struggles for labor and civil rights, it also supported the Soviet Union. From the start, the American Communist Party faced attacks from conservatives and business leaders, as well as from liberals who criticized its ties to the oppressive Soviet regime. In World War II, when the USA and USSR were allied against Hitler, some American communists actually spied for the Russians. When the Cold War escalated and this espionage became known, domestic communism came to be seen as a threat to national security. But the attempt to eliminate that threat soon turned into the longest-lasting and most widespread episode of political repression in American history. Bird on by a network of bureaucrats, politicians, journalists, and businessmen, the campaign wildly exaggerated the danger of communist subversion. The people behind it harassed anyone suspected of holding left-of-center political views or associating with those who did. If you hung modern art on your walls, had a multiracial social circle, or signed petitions against nuclear weapons, you might just have been a communist. Following in the late 1940s, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover used the resources of his agency to hunt down such supposed communists and eliminate them from any position of influence with an American society. And the narrow criteria that Hoover and his allies used to screen federal employees spread to the rest of the country. Soon, Hollywood studios, universities, car manufacturers, and thousands of other public and private employers were imposing the same political tests on the men and women who worked for them. Meanwhile, Congress conducted its own witch hunt, subpoenaing hundreds of people to testify before investigative bodies like the House Un-American Activities Committee. If they refused to cooperate, they could be jailed for contempt, or more commonly fired and blacklisted. Obitious politicians like Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy used such hearings as a partisan weapon, accusing Democrats of being soft on communism and deliberately losing China to the communist block. McCarthy, a Republican senator from Wisconsin, became notorious by flaunting ever-changing lists of alleged communists within the State Department. Meg Don by other politicians, he continued to make outrageous accusations while distorting or fabricating evidence. Many citizens reviled McCarthy while others praised him. And when the Korean War broke out, McCarthy seemed vindicated. Once he became chair of the Senate's permanent subcommittee on investigations in 1953, McCarthy's recklessness increased. It was his investigation of the army that finally turned public opinion against him and diminished his power. McCarthy's colleagues in the Senate censured him, and he died less than three years later, probably from alcoholism. McCarthyism ended as well. It had ruined hundreds if not thousands of lives and drastically narrowed the American political spectrum. Its damage to democratic institutions would be long-lasting. In all likelihood, there were both Democrats and Republicans who knew that the anti-communist purges were deeply unjust, but feared that directly opposing them would hurt their careers. Even the Supreme Court failed to stop the witch hunt, condoning serious violations of constitutional rights in the name of national security. Was domestic communism an actual threat to the American government? Perhaps, though a small one. But the reaction to it was so extreme that it caused far more damage than the threat itself.

Mark Meadows is trying to get the Rico case, at least his portion of it, moved from Fulton County to a federal court because he thinks he'll get a better jury pool there. But in order for that to happen, he has to go in front of a judge and sort of plead his case, right? To say, I was acting in an official capacity of the federal government when all of this was taking place. That's how he can get the case moved. But if he does that, then he has to testify. He has to take the stand and then allow cross-examination by Fanny Willis, which he is never going to do. He can't introduce that defense by saying I was acting in an official capacity, with him saying it has to come from an outside source. Is he going to get that? Probably not because he has to do all of this stuff and then meet with the judge on Monday. So when Monday comes, and he goes before the judge to the hearing that's already been set by the judge to say you have to come in, he's assumed response, meaning like the thing that's most likely to happen is for him to get that rejected. But should set a precedent for basically all of the other defendants. I'm not saying that it's going to happen that way. I'm just saying it's more likely than not, this is not going to get granted.

First thing I'd like to say is that people have the right to peacefully assemble and petition their government. They have free speech, freedom of press, freedom of religion. I strongly support the First Amendment of our Constitution. One thing I oppose is when the government starts locking down cities or the whole area of a government or whatever jurisdiction it is. I oppose the idea of lockdowns when people start protesting. Now I do support that the police should go in and stop violent protestors in a peaceful way and a civil way. I don't support violent protesters. They need to be in jail. Anyone who does violence to protest, they belong in jail. They don't punish the rest of the people living in an area because some knuckleheads are being violent. Throw the knuckleheads in jail. Don't punish the people who have to live near it or anything like that. I oppose that. But I would like to say is that we need to support our right to peacefully assemble. I support the idea when people peacefully assemble and they're protesting. When you protest, do it in a peaceful way. That's how you get your voice heard. And that's the most effective way is a peaceful protest. Don't ever get violent. And I'd like to thank you for watching this video. Please subscribe.

The first thing I'd like to say is that we need to enforce the Constitution of the United States of America. The President should not be allowed to go to war without congressional approval. I oppose the idea of the President using an executive order to go to war with other countries. And the other thing is, we should have never been in these wars in the first place to begin with. The government needs to stay out of these wars. The United States needs to focus on domestic policy instead of policing the rest of the world. The United States is not the world's policemen. The United States needs to stay out of these wars, stop wasting our taxpayer money on these wars, and we need to stay out of the business of these other countries. Now, I do think the United States should be improving relationships with other countries. I support diplomatic things. I mean, I support that the United States builds good relationships with other countries. I oppose sanctions because sanctions only hurt people in these other countries against the idea of the government putting sanctions on other countries. I think what we need to do is build good relations with these other countries and focus on building up our own country and focus on domestic policy. And as far as immigration, I support the idea of people coming here legally and we should have a pathway to citizenship for people who want to come to this country legally, of course, we should secure the border in an effective way. I didn't support Trump's immigration policy. I don't like how he did things with immigration. I support the idea of a pathway to citizenship for people in a legal way. I don't support just kicking out a certain group or anything like that. I think we need a good pathway to citizenship and secure the border to make sure people are legally coming in, not illegally coming in. And I'd like to thank you for watching this video.

We fought for moral reasons. We passed laws, struck down laws for moral reasons. We waged wars on poverty enough for people. We sacrificed, we cared about our neighbors. We put our money where our mouths were, and we never beat our chests. We built great big things made on godly technological advances, explored the universe, cured disease, and we cultivated the world's greatest artists and the world's greatest economy. We reached for the stars, acted like men. We aspired to intelligence, we didn't belittle it, it didn't make us feel impure. We didn't identify ourselves by who we voted for in the last election, and we didn't scare so easy. We were able to be all these things and do all these things because we were informed.

@joyreidofficial_video_7269989898113912106.txt," My family fought to save their farm under this flag. Who was working that farm? My family was. My family was. Who was working the farm? They were poor. Do you know how much a slave cost back in? There's actually a noble answer to that question. By 1860 at the time of the Civil War, enslaved people's value was somewhere between $200 on the low end all the way up to $2,000. We're talking about in today's dollars, maybe somewhere between $2,400 and $50,000. There are even some estimates that say that some enslaved people were valued at somewhere around $180,000 in today's dollars. So you can think of it basically like owning a car. And about 1.6% of southern families owned more than 200 slaves, like having a whole car dealership. But about 20 to 25% of southerners at the time of the Civil War owned at least one enslaved person. It's like basically living in a society where wealthy people all have cars. Well, what do all the people who don't have cars want? A car. And even if a family worked on a small farm and didn't have enslaved people, what do you think their goal was? Their goal was to earn enough money to be able to buy people, to buy humans to do the work. It's not like families didn't aspire to have enslaved people. Why do you think that southern whites were willing to go to war? To literally go to war against the United States for slavery? Because remember every single state that's associated all 11 of them said explicitly, we're doing this to preserve slavery. Well, why would somebody who's on a small farm want to fight to preserve slavery? Because their aspiration was to become a major planter, which means a major slave owner. That's what they all wanted to do. That's what they all aspired to do. And they also wanted to defend the system whereby they couldn't be enslaved. Only Africans could. Only black people. And so that system of hierarchy that allowed any white person, no matter how rich or poor, to be superior to any black person, and for that black person to be captured and treated as property, and their children and their children's children owned by a white person. This is a system that benefited every single white person in this out. And by the way, every white person in the north too. Because even if you weren't a slave owner, you benefited from the economy that cotton production, that rice production, that all of these industries generated, you could benefit by being an insurance owner. Slaves were insured, like cars. And slave people also produced goods that were sold. So if you were somebody who was in the shipping business, or the cotton milling business, all of them benefited from slavery. So whether you were a small farmer or a big farmer, the slavery system benefited you. And you were willing to go to war to preserve it and to preserve white supremacy, because that was the whole basis of your society. And by the way, a lot of people in this out went to war simply because they were told to, and because they're rich people around them, made sure that the poor kids were doing the fighting. And so it doesn't matter whether your family was rich, poor, had one slave or ten or none. It doesn't matter. Everyone in the south benefited from that economy in that system, and they went toward a preserve it and to preserve white supremacy forever. So that's the answer to your question. You also told on yourself just by saying that at all, because like, why are you curious about how much they cost? You missed that system, right? You think things were better than? One last note, that flag is not even the flag that your forefathers fought under for their farm. That was not the flag of the Confederacy. That's a flag that they created afterwards. It's literally just a symbol of racism and white supremacy. And you're flying it because... ...mega. Peace out.",subjective

MAGA is an ideology. It's a statement. It's a feeling. It's a belief. It means make America great again. I can't imagine in a million years why there would be anybody that wouldn't support that statement if they're American. But it isn't a person. It isn't an organized group.

@kahlilgreene_video_7283182320817933611.txt," So last weekend, Tick Tock and Vitya made it attend my first ever Black Tie event at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Phoenix Awards Gala. At the event where celebrities like L.L. Cool J and my friend in Tennessee State rap Justin Jones. And the president even came to give an address which has since gone pretty viral but we'll talk about that another time. But stay to get ready with me and learn more about the Congressional Black Caucus aka the CBC. So the CBC was established in 1971 shortly after the huge legislative wins of the Civil Rights Movement. It's founding members include Shirley Chizoum who was the first Black woman elected to Congress and who introduced more than 50 pieces of legislation including some to end the Vietnam War. It also included Ralph Metcalf who was an Olympic gold medalist and who introduced the Congressional resolution that officially established Black History Month. Right now in the 118th Congress, the CBC has 58 members more than ever before. And while it's high Republican members in the past, the current makeup of the CBC is entirely Democrat. GOP members like Trump supporter representative Byron Donalds have been refused entry while other Black Republicans like Senator Tim Scott have the client invitation. But according to the caucus, the CBC aims to be nonpartisan and they want to work across the aisle and policy issues. Right now, the CBC is most significantly credited with pushing voting rights legislation and currently they're prioritizing passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to modernizing strength in the Voting Rights Act of 1965. They've also pushed for education investment especially in HBCUs as well as pushed for federal holidays like MLK Day and June 10th. Internally though, CBC members have various policy priorities and agendas from Congressman Horseford who is pushing for more diverse military to Congresswoman Cory Bush who have personally worked with the push for federal reparations. And just because the CBC is called the Congressional Black Caucus doesn't necessarily mean that all Black Americans feel represented by every single piece of legislation they've put forward. For example, I actually wrote my senior thesis in college on how in the past, the CBC almost universally supported the infamous 1994 crime bill which was a part of the devastating war on crime. How did you feel about the CBC and how do you feel about this fit? Let me know in the comments and follow for more.",subjective

It's hard to talk in public, as you well know, sir, about undersea warfare and our efforts in that regard.

I think I think there needs to be clarification of how expensive they are in the process of creating those Embryos. Do you think it should be illegal to store Embryos and do you think it should be illegal to describe that? I think because a lot of times it's utilized for sort of research development and of Embryos and tossing away life and the storage of them. Yeah, I think it needs to be for that time. Again, I know it's an expensive process and could lead to failure, but at the same time I think it's really reckless to create all these Embryos and to freeze them. Parents should lose control of the Embryos they created. You want the state to decide what happens to those Embryos rather than parents will create. That's not at all what I'm saying. What I'm saying is at the time that they're seeking to create and become pregnant that they're just creating the Embryos for that initial pregnancy. If that's not successful at that time, then they can come back and create for that particular pregnancy, but not create a big giant where you have 15 to 20 Embryos that are then having to be stored for eternity. Additional Embryos are often created because the first text I understand why they do that, but that again it leads to the reckless storage and disposal of human life. The state should decide what happens to those Embryos rather than parents. They're there to get pregnant. They're there to create a life in the womb and it needs to be that particular life. We're really in Alabama basically putting state in charge of the disposal process or what the term of what happens to them. And all the IAF and the IAF and the IAF and the IAF are shut down.

Learn to think like a lawyer for free for two months by clicking on the link in the description. Hey, Legal Eagles, it's time to think like a lawyer, because the president could use some good advice unlike the bad legal advice he seems to be getting at the moment. Today, we're going to discuss one of the newest scandals to rock the White House, the allegations of bribery and potential abuse of power by President Trump in exchange for getting dirt on presidential candidate Joe Biden. All hell seems to be breaking loose here in Washington, and although you could probably say that on any given day, this time it seems to be a little different because of one thing. House Democrats have announced that they are formally opening an inquiry into the impeachment of the president of the United States. This doesn't happen every day. To understand how we got here, you need to know the facts about Donald Trump's conversation with the president of Ukraine, a mysterious high-level whistleblower, the many faces of Rudy Giuliani, and what all that has to do with Joe Biden's son. So, to take a step back, Ukraine is a country in Eastern Europe that was formally a part of the Soviet Union. The country currently has a rocky relationship with Russia because Russian troops have invaded part of Ukraine's territory, the Crimea, back in 2014. Ukrainian citizens protested Russian involvement in their government, ousting President Viktor Yanukovych for conspiring with Russia. Now, the United States and most of the world condemned Russia and warned it against further interference in Ukrainian sovereignty. Later that same year, then Vice President Biden went to Ukraine to deliver U.S. aid. Now, fast forward a few years, in July of 2019, the Washington Post reported that a high-ranking intelligence official had filed a whistleblower complaint about promises that President Trump had made during communication and interaction with a foreign leader. Several news organizations reported that this whistleblower complaint involved President Trump promising aid to Ukraine if they dug up some dirt on Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son. Trump himself confirmed part of the story. Hunter Biden was a member of the board of a company called Berezma Holdings, the largest gas company in Ukraine. That company was known for having some ties to former President of Ukraine, Viktor Vienniković. Hunter Biden remained a board member of Berezma until 2019. So, what is the deal with this intelligence community whistleblower? Well, I probably don't need to tell you that it is incredibly unusual for a member of the intelligence community to, number one, file a whistleblower complaint. There are strict guidelines that one must follow in order to blow the whistle on the intelligence community. And it is almost unheard of that a whistleblower would blow the whistle on the President of the United States. That just has never happened before. And on September 9th, intelligence community general inspector or the ICIG, Michael Ackinson informed representatives Adam Schiff and Devon Nunez, who were on the House Intelligence Committee, that he had forwarded a whistleblower report to acting director of National Intelligence Joseph McGuire. A whistleblower is a person who exposes information that he or she believes is illegal or unethical. Governmental whistleblowers are not unusual, but a whistleblower at this level of the government in the intelligence community, making an allegation of the President absolutely is incredibly unusual. Inspector Ackinson determined that the report was, quote, an urgent concern, end quote, and quote, credible. Urgent and credible are two statutory requirements that require the ICIG to forward the complaint to Congress. Ackinson's ruling immediately made this a very serious allegation that Congress wanted to review. However, acting director of National Intelligence McGuire stepped in to claim that the complaint was not required to be released to Congress. Now remember this fact about acting DNI McGuire as we'll come back to it later. This fact could be the first indication of a cover-up by the White House and the Department of Justice. At the time of this video, we don't have all of the facts, we don't have the entire ICIG complaint, but news reports are indicating that President Trump may have threatened to withhold $400 million in military aid to Ukraine if it did not investigate Hunter Biden among other things. The Trump administration had criticized the Obama administration for not providing lethal foreign aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. So earlier this year, Congress appropriated almost $400 million in military aid, $250 million in explicit military aid and $150 million going through the State Department, that can be used for lethal force by the Ukrainians to buy military goods from the Americans. The argument, of course, being that Ukraine needs that military aid to help fight against Russia in Crimea and was approved by the Pentagon and Congress. However, for months, President Trump froze that military aid. Some reports indicate that government employees were instructed to obfuscate or lie to Congress about the reason for why that money was frozen. It's not necessarily unusual to freeze this kind of military aid, but under these circumstances it appears to be highly unusual and we'll get to why in just a moment. Although there is much speculation over the contents of the whistleblower report, President Trump and his personal lawyer and advisor Rudy Giuliani started confirming aspects of this particular story just days after it was broken. President Trump spoke with new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by telephone on July 25th, just days after Robert Mueller had testified in Congress. When President Trump allegedly mentioned his desire to have Biden investigated up to eight times. According to Trump, he summarizes phone call saying, We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption, picking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden has done, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine. Ukraine's got a lot of problems. President Trump described the phone call as, quote, perfect. It's very important to talk about corruption. If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt? So it's very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption. So President Trump agrees that he spoke about alleged corruption by the Biden's, and that he also was reluctant to give money to Ukraine because he says the country is corrupt. A potential flaw with this argument is that the United States gives military aid to many different countries, not the least of which is Saudi Arabia, but the President does not seem to be doing any kind of corruption analysis with respect to those other countries. This may be specifically geared towards Ukraine and these unusual circumstances. The President Trump wasn't done yet. Speaking a few days later at the United Nations, President Trump said, Joe Biden and his son are corrupt. All right, but the fake news doesn't want to report it because they're Democrats. If that ever happened, if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, then beginning the electric chair by right now. So what is it that President Trump alleges the Biden's did? President Trump alleges that Joe Biden used American financial aid to pressure the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor in 2016. The theory is that the prosecutor, Victor Shokin, was investigating Ukraine's largest gas company, Berizma. Although President Trump has been vague about what the Biden's did that deserved the so-called electric chair, the corruption allegations have been investigated and dismissed. Shokin was accused of being soft on corruption. The United States was not alone in calling for his ouster. Other Western nations in the entire European Union also called on Ukraine to remove him. And the Ukrainian parliament eventually voted to remove Shokin. According to Bloomberg News, which did an extensive report on the matter in 2019, the Berizma investigation had already been dead for about a year by the time the vice president Biden called for Shokin to be sacked. And there is no indication that Hunter Biden personally was being investigated for corruption. The former Ukrainian prosecutor general told Bloomberg that he found no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden. But President Trump would not let that debunked story die, stating Biden, quote, said, I'm not going to give billions of dollars to Ukraine unless they remove this prosecutor. And they removed the prosecutor supposedly in one hour. And the prosecutor was prosecuting the company of the son and the son. He just shouldn't have said that. Now as far as my conversation, it was perfect. It was a perfect conversation. As you may be aware, Joe Biden has consistently been the Democratic front runner against President Trump in the 2020 presidential election and has consistently led Donald Trump in head-to-head polls. President Trump and Rudy Giuliani have already confirmed many aspects, although not all of the aspects of this particular story. So what's going up with Rudy Giuliani, you may ask. Well, Rudy Giuliani is one of the president's personal lawyers. He has no formal job with the US government, but allegedly has been acting as a messenger for President Trump with Ukraine. In another one of Mr. Giuliani's legendary TV appearances, Giuliani has admitted that he spent several months pressuring Ukraine for dirt on the Biden's, appearing on Chris Cuomo's CNN program. Giuliani said, I have the only thing I asked about Joe Biden is to get to the bottom of how it was that Wood Sanko, who was appointed, dismissed the case against Antelope. So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden? Of course I did. So we already know that Giuliani met with Ukrainian officials in May and August of this year. The August meeting was just a week after President Trump froze all of the military aid that Congress and the Pentagon had appropriated for Ukraine. Giuliani said that during the August meeting, a Ukrainian official promised to, quote, get to the bottom, end quote, of the Biden situation. The Wall Street Journal reported that this was part of an ongoing effort by President Trump to have the Ukrainians work with Giuliani to find some dirt on the Biden's in exchange for the promised aid. Now, on its face, there are major problems with Giuliani's role in all of this. Giuliani is not a member of the US government and should not be conducting US foreign policy.",subjective

@letsmakethempay_video_7257116363582377258.txt," Did you hear the hilarious joke about a maximum wage? When Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison mentioned a maximum wage during a meeting with the Congressional Progressive Caucus in 2018, one reporter assumed he must have been making a joke. Whoever heard of such a thing, when asked about his joke, Ellison fired back that he was not joking at all. Ellison described the income disparity between McDonald's workers trying to get $15 an hour and the CEO who makes approximately $9,000 an hour. If we say you're incalculable greed is not acceptable, we get called communists. Why not call CEOs what they are, which is ever-ishest and greedy? There seems to be a little recognition that it is disgustingly greedy for the US ultra-rich to take so much when millions of Americans don't make nearly enough. For example, returning to the minimum wage for contrast, one 2018 study showed that even working full-time at the US minimum wage, no worker would be able to afford rent in an average priced one-bedroom home in any state in the union. According to researchers, a minimum wage worker would need to work 99 hours per week for all 52 weeks of the year or approximately 2.5 full-time jobs to afford a one-bedroom home at the National Average Fair Market Rent. It is the poverty of the minimum wage workers that makes the inflated compensation of US CEOs possible. It would take a typical McDonald's employee more than 3,000 years to earn with the CEO got paid just in 2017. But still, the idea of a maximum wage is so absurd, it must be a joke! It turns out that the idea of a maximum wage hasn't always been such a hilarious notion. In fact, the US almost got a maximum wage during World War II. On April 27, 1942, President Roosevelt asked the Congress to institute a maximum wage because of the war effort. He said, no American citizen ought to have a net income after he paid his taxes of more than 25,000 a year, the equivalent of about 486,000 in 2023. The way it would have worked is that a 100% war super tax would have taxed away all income above a certain threshold. The official proposal landed on 40,000 for individuals and 110,000 for married couples. It turns out that even during World War II, this idea was abridged too far, yet by wars and top income tax rates had climbed 94%. Here, slight post-war dip-top income tax rates for the rich stayed above 90% through the Republican Eisenhower administration and didn't drop until rich man president John F. Kennedy cut them to 77%. Today's top income tax rates for the rich max out at 37%. As author Sam Pitsigatti points out, if it's possible for us to understand the concept of a wage floor, a minimum amount of compensation for people to survive on, why not a ceiling? The thing is, this hilarious concept of a maximum wage or even tax rates of about 90% as was once brought the accepted or 70% would be really good for the American economy. You don't have to take my word for it, just look at what happened when the US had those very high tax rates on the rich. It was that period of time that conservatives loved to idealize, a single wage earner, a new car every couple of years, broad-based prosperity. It was called the Golden Age of Capitalism, the post-war period encompassing the 1950s to the 1970s. It was also a period of huge tax rates on the rich and the highest percentage of union membership in our nation's history. There was a rationale for high tax rates on the rich back then. Matthew Iglesias points out that having 90% tax rates meant that companies had to pay executives a thousand dollars for every 100 in increased pay. Rather than send 900 dollars to the tax man, there was greater incentive to spread that money around with smaller raises for less extravagantly paid workers. Making more money to more people rather than the rich stimulated the economy. This is a big part of the reason that growth rates and productivity rose with wages during that period. But the policies that made those things possible were abandoned a long time ago. Ronald Reagan and his predecessor, Jimmy Carter, blew up redistributive policies that had been around since the New Deal by slashing taxes on the rich, a trend that continues all the way to today. The idea behind the first Reagan tax cuts was that they were supposed to stimulate growth. Instead of stimulating growth, however, cutting taxes on the rich has only choked growth off to even lower levels than the US economy had before Reagan was elected. Tax cuts for the rich have made things worse. Bribing the rich has failed to increase growth for 40 years, yet both the major parties that make up the US political class stubbornly refuse to do anything different. Instead in truly insane fashion, they continue to cut taxes on the rich, in the supposed hope that doing the same thing, which also happens to be the politically expedient thing, will somehow achieve a different result. It never will. Here's what you need to know. Inequality is a political choice. There is no law of nature that says CEOs and executives need to make 400 times with the rest of their workforce makes. There is no principle in economics that says the wealthiest handful at the top should hold more wealth than the poorest half of all Americans. America's vast economic inequality has been brought to us purposefully through decades of choices and changes in American law. We live in the world that rich people want because they have bought and paid for it. But it's even more important for you to know that what has been done can also be undone. This inequality is not a law of nature. It can be reversed. We don't have to accept the status quo. I don't think a maximum wage is a hilarious joke. Taxing the rich is good for our economy. It makes sense. There's a reason that we used to do it aggressively in this country. We should do it again. Please like, follow, favorite, comment, and subscribe to my free subs deck.

@lexi.overstreet_video_7330106642069163310.txt," 24 conservative lawmakers in Pennsylvania have violated federal lawsuit concerning three actions aimed at increasing voter registration in the state of Pennsylvania. The lawsuit concerns a 2021 executive order by President Biden. This executive order basically says, hey, federal agencies, you need to consider ways on how to increase access to voter registration and voter information. It also concerns the September implementation and introduction of automatic voter registration by Governor Shapiro. So there's a federal law that says all the MVs you have to be able to register to vote there when you know you're getting your license and stuff. So previously in Pennsylvania when you went in there would be a prompt on the computer that says do you want to register to vote if you hit yes, then it took you to the form. However, now when you go in to renew your license or get a license, it automatically takes you to the voter registration form. And then obviously you can opt out if you don't want to register to vote. Pennsylvania has already seen a 44% increase in voter registration for this time compared to the same time period two years ago. Historically states that have implemented automatic voter registration, someone's called voter voter have seen massive increases in voter registration and it's been very effective. And lastly, the lawsuit concerns a 2018 state directive by then governor Tom Wolf and that basically directed counties to say that you could not throw out someone's application to register to vote solely because their driver's license number or their social security. Number did not match what was in the computer database. The lawmakers who filed the lawsuit say that these three actions either required legislative approval, which was never gotten or they conflict with existing Pennsylvania law.",subjective

@lisaremillard_video_7322615862777695531.txt," We are now just nine days away from a government shutdown and nowhere closer to a deal. Now, for those of you who follow my page first, thank you for that. But you might be thinking, Lisa, did you just tell us like two days ago that the House and the Senate leadership had just agreed to a more than one and a half trillion dollar deal to avoid this shutdown? Yes. Yes, I said that. And the deal is real. But I also told you in that very same video, the far right Republican House Freedom Caucus was pissed about it. They did not like this deal at all because it did not include the drastic budget cuts they wanted or the strict border policies they wanted. And today about a dozen of them flexed their muscle. They voted down a simple procedural step that would have moved this deal forward. So where does that leave us? On January 19th, a large piece of the United States government will shut down. The rest of the government will shut down on February 2nd unless Congress passes several funding bills known as appropriations bills. Now, this is not a matter of passing one big huge bill to avoid the shutdown. Before January 19th, Congress would need to pass four appropriations bills through both the House and the Senate. And then the remaining eight appropriations bills would need to be passed before the rest of the government shuts down on February 2nd. At this point, they've passed zero appropriation bills. Zero of them have been passed through the House and the Senate. And here's the thing. In the Senate, things just take longer. So one piece of legislation typically takes about a week to pass through the Senate. So you do the math. If there are four bills, that would technically take four weeks. And we have nine days. So just yesterday, Senate Republicans said the House and the Senate need to pass another stopgap measure called a continuing resolution so they can kick the can down the road for a certain amount of time and give themselves more time to get these appropriation bills passed before the government shuts down. But Speaker Johnson isn't a fan of this plan and the same conservative House Republicans are saying absolutely no way will they go for that again. And in case you're keeping track, yes, this is exactly the same series of events that led to former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy being kicked out of his job. A consensus of Republicans have not said that they want to kick Johnson out yet. But at least one conservative Republican said it's definitely a possibility. And generally, I can tell you the Republicans are not happy with Johnson at least not right now. So who knows how this is going to be fixed in just nine days.",subjective
@lisaremillard_video_7330071049293417771.txt," House Republicans are about to move forward with an impeachment resolution, but it's not an impeachment of President Biden. A meeting has been going on all day today of the House Homeland Security Committee. Lawmakers are preparing to take a final vote late tonight and if that vote is successful, which it's expected to be. Articles of impeachment for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorquez will be referred to the full House of Representatives for high crimes and misdemeanors. This is the first time in almost 150 years that the House has tried to remove a member of the president's cabinet through impeachment and wait till you hear the story of the last guy that went through it. He's a real peach. I'm gonna tell you about him in a second. But first, let's talk about Mayorquez. You may be wondering, what crimes or misdemeanors has he actually committed? Well, according to the draft articles of impeachment, Mayorquez will fully and systematically refuse to comply with federal immigration laws and he's guilty of breach of public trust by knowingly making false statements to Congress and obstructing the oversight of his department. Republican say Mayorquez is responsible for the chaos happening at the U.S. Mexico border and hasn't been following the laws. Secretary Mayorquez has testified in front of this very House committee several times and it's been, let's just say heated. Today, ahead of the committee's meeting, Mayorquez fired off this scathing six-page letter where he pushes back on the committee's claim that he's not enforcing immigration laws. He says that is false. He goes on to say this administration has actually removed or returned or expelled more migrants in three years than the prior administration did in four years. Then he lists all the actions the Homeland Security Department has taken at the border and all the actual numbers of migrant expulsions. His letter acknowledges that, yeah, the immigration system is broken, but Mayorquez says the only way to fix it is for Congress to pass some new legislation. He then goes on to say he's been working with that bipartisan group of senators to do just that. He's been part of that big border deal that I told you about in this video. It's a deal that the House speaker has said, even if it does pass the Senate, it's dead on arrival in the House. Republicans are now saying no new legislation is needed to correct what's happening at the border. So now what? Well, the committee will take a vote tonight to move the impeachment articles for Secretary Alejandro Mayorquez forward. Then it will go to the full House for a vote in the coming weeks, whether it will pass the House is a whole different story. So yeah, Republicans have the majority in the House, but as I told you in this video, because of the Republicans who are no longer in their seats, the House GOP has only a two vote margin. Obviously, no Democrats are going to vote for the impeachment of Alejandro Mayorquez. That means the House speaker can only lose two Republicans to no votes if he really wants this impeachment to pass. That is going to be tough. And even if it does somehow pass the House, the Senate will never convict him. Oh, and by the way, this is going to take weeks, weeks spent on this instead of other work. But if the Republicans are successful in this impeachment, it would be the first time in almost 150 years a cabinet secretary has been impeached. Now, this is the story I've been waiting to tell you. The last time this happened was May of 1876 when William Belknapp then wore Secretary for President Ulysses Grant was impeached by the House for corruption, apparently. He received $20,000 in kickbacks from a traitor that he awarded a government contract to. So how did Congress figure it out? Well, apparently, Belknapp wasn't hiding it. He loved to show off his wealth at parties he was hosting in Washington and both his first and second wives loved the luxury items. And we're always dressed to the nines. And people started to wonder how the hell was Belknapp affording such a lavish lifestyle and is $8,000 a year government salary. In the end, the Senate failed to convict Belknapp of the impeachment. So he was impeached by the House, but not convicted in the Senate. He was acquitted and he was not prosecuted any further.",subjective

And the news is that we are headed for a government shutdown and a presidential impeachment. The first thing that happened when we all got back last week was one of the leaders of the right flank gave a big speech on the floor of the house. It was a speech directed to the leader of his own party in the house, the speaker. He basically said, hey Mr. Speaker, if you pass a budget that our group doesn't like, we'll fire you. We've got the votes to end your speakership and we will call a vote every single day until you're gone. But what he really meant was, look, we know you're going to pass a budget this year and we're not going to like it. So you have to give us something we want or we'll fire you. The number one thing they want is a shutdown because a shutdown comes with a ton of media attention for them. And as I've told you for a lot of them, media attention is the whole ballgame. People who had changed last week was the right flank basically saying that a shutdown wouldn't be enough. They wanted something more. Impeachment. The speaker really didn't want to give them that, but he did. Technically, he just began the impeachment investigation, but if he doesn't go through with impeachment at the end of the investigation, the right flank would just threaten to fire him again and he'll do it. So basically, in exchange for being able to pass a budget at some point this year, the speaker is trading his right flank, a shutdown and an impeachment. The reason the speaker doesn't want to do either of those things is he's worried they're going to hurt his party in the next election and he wants to grow his majority. Right now he only has a majority by five votes, which has made his life a living nightmare because it means he just gets taken hostage over and over again by his right flank. Meanwhile, his right flank knows that if he's successful in growing their majority, ironically, it just means less power for them, which is why they're fine forcing the speaker to do things that could backfire in the next election. Having a narrow majority lets them remain the decisive faction. And if forcing a shutdown for media attention seems like a really weird strategy, it's because you're not the target audience. The target is voters who get almost all of their news from certain cable news shows. That's who this whole maneuver is built for. It's a swivever of politicians working with a swivever media to reach a swivever of voters. And if you're not in that small group, then none of this makes any sense. So that's the latest, and I'll keep you posted.",subjective
@maddowshow_video_7213470838778039598.txt," But whether you like Mr. Trump or you do not like him, it is both fair play and relevant and it is starting to feel important to remember that our politics broadly is absolutely full of public officials, current and former public officials, both parties neither party every state in the union. We are full of current and former public officials who have been charged with all kinds of crimes and convicted of everything imaginable. Members of Congress and senators and governors, even a serving attorney general like these guys, but also state legislators, big city mayor, statewide elected officials, cabinet officials, White House officials, it happens, it happens all the time. And while that's bad, well, it turns out we've had a lot of crooks in public office, that doesn't feel great. What's good about it is that we know how to deal with it when it happens. It doesn't break our system. It does not break our country to bring serious charges against public officials and former public officials. Even these exact charges that are reportedly on deck against former President Donald Trump in New York, you will recall that this guy, a former senator, a Democratic Party vice presidential nominee, he was brought up on charges almost exactly like what's being reported about allegations against former President Trump. John Edwards was brought up on charges for lying about and concealing a hush money payment that was made to cover up an alleged affair before an election. Those exact charges were brought against a Democratic vice presidential nominee and former senator. And you know what? You forgot about it because the country wasn't exactly rocked to its foundations. Another serving vice president, serving vice president, went up against a 40 count felony indictment for crimes committed while he was in office. With him, they forced him to resign as office as part of a plea deal in federal criminal court. I did a podcast and a book about it and it blew everybody's mind because we've completely forgotten about it because it didn't create a lasting problem for us as a country. It does not bend the Constitution, let alone break it to indict criminals for crimes, even when the alleged criminal is someone who has been elected to a very important job. It is run of the mill public corruption law enforcement in this country and we do it all the time. And there is no reason why a former president should be magically immune from the same legal system that just in the past three years has put handcuffs on at least 13 state senators, 17 state representatives, one serving congressman, one former congressman, the Delaware state auditor, the North Carolina Republican Party chair, the insurance commissioner of Georgia and too many city councilors Alderman County executives and mayors to count. It happens all the time. It really does not have to be the end of the world. And anybody telling you that if there is an indictment of this particular former public official, there will be a protest like you've never seen before. There will be civil war. There will be an unstoppable uprising among his supporters and violence and all the rest. Anybody telling you that that is the consequence of him being potentially indicted? Well, that person may be wishing for that. But there's no reason that something like that is inevitable. This is not something coming up that is extraneous to our system that we need to invent something new to contend with. The bottom line here is that prosecuting public officials and former public officials, it happens all the time in the United States of America. And it never engenders violence. And it never endangers the country. And it doesn't require our legal system to be fundamentally rethought or dismantled. Unless someone wants to try to gin that up.

There is a commissioner and a deputy commissioner in between the Secretary of myself. Do you communicate with him often? I communicate often with the Secretary several times a week, sir. So I want to piggyback off of what Mr. Green said, because we were just read in on this explosive device that was discovered by one of your board of patrol agents. Now obviously, sir, you're aware of this. How is it that you are not? Because as the investigative arm of the department, we're focused on investigating TCOs and the intelligence shared between our two agencies is robust. It happens all the time. The we're not actively. So here's my issue. This is one of the issues I see between the and I respect everything that both of you do and every way they're worked for you. But the breakdown of communication and the silos that we work in is what's detrimental to this country right now. And if there is an explosive device, if the cartels are using explosive device against our agents, that changes the narrative. So can I answer my job as the assistant director over a clear-ass. The transnational organized crime is not domestic operations. Our domestic operations folks that work in the field day in and day out are the ones that communicate with the board of patrol. I'm saying me personally, I do not know. I have I can get back to you and let you know whether HSI as a whole knows and our domestic operations knows. So I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you. So I would assume that the two individuals that you report to, sir, have reported to some Secretary Mayorkas about this explosive device, which tells me that Mayorkas is reported this to the president and nothing has been said or done to the American public and Congress was had no idea this was going on. Now if this is the case and we're surging money, billions, hundreds of billions of dollars across the seas to secure everybody else and we're not doing anything here in my state and our southern border, that's a problem because that means that they're lying to us. Response? I will tell you that if there's a significant event along the southwest border, whether it's a significant seizure or an arrest, we, I'm not talking about drugs anymore. I'm talking about explosives. Any significant event, whether it be a terrorist, whether it be a significant narcotics load, criminal alien high-value target, we will coordinate with our investigative partners and they vary in numbers, whether it's FBI, whether it's the DEA or our HSI partners. We all belong to joint terrorism task force. If it's associated with terrorism, every single one of us has an agent or a task force member. And so that information is shared amongst that group. It hasn't been shared with us, okay? And so here's my problem. If you share something of this nature with us, we can help, okay? Another question, Chief. You said consequences and you said that your agents don't feel like they have legislation or their legislation is not enforced to support them in their duties. Who specifically is telling you not to do that? What memo and whose name is on the bottom of that so we can go after them? When I say consequences, I'm talking about two things. I'm talking about prosecutions and I'm talking about repatriations back to their home country. We have to have those tools in our toolkit to be able to deal with the migrant surges that we're seeing right now. With respect to legislative changes or policy changes, that's out of my willhouse, Congressman. That is your responsibility. That's the administration's responsibility. My responsibility is to enforce the laws on the books and do everything I can to make sure our men and women have the tools that they need out there to do the job. Okay, so tell me right now which ones you need that are in place, that they're not being enforced a week so we can do something about that. And if you don't have that in front of you right now, please get it to me. I will. So I interrupt as the chairman just a second. I want to make sure I understand Mr. Lakshaw's questions. You're asking which policies need to be reinstated in order for him to do his job as a sur. Okay. Yes sir. I'm sorry if that didn't come out clearly. I thought it's okay. Go ahead Chief. Once again, whatever consequences you can call it, migrant protection protocols, you can call it remain in Mexico, you can call it a safe third country. All of the tools that the bourgeois and DHS have at their disposal are going to allow us to do a better job of managing this border. I yield back sir.",objective

@matteo_il_pazzeo_video_7303707157961280814.txt," a disastrous decision that jeopardizes the voting rights of millions of Americans, potentially, has just been handed down by the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. In this decision, the Court concluded that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act does not include a so-called private right of action, a right that has been implied by the courts for many years. This means that only the federal government and not private groups or private parties can bring suit for a violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. You heard that right. Under today's decision, when minorities are disenfranchised through practices by the state or the federal government that discriminate against them on the basis of color, race, or language minority, only the federal government and specifically the attorney general's office can sue and not private individuals. This is a problem because it jeopardizes the ability of countless minorities across the United States to see their vote counted, because currently the vast majority of cases regarding the Voting Rights Act are brought to court through private groups. Additionally, this decision puts 100% of the power to bring lawsuit in the hands of the attorney general, and we know that the attorney general's office has discretion on whether to bring any suit to light or not. This decision is not only obviously very dangerous, but also very startling because it's a clear departure from established jurisprudence from the way courts traditionally decided in these matters. And here is the other problem, because the circuit is split between this decision and decisions in other circuits that have recognized a private right of action, this ruling will certainly be headed for the U.S. Supreme Court. And if you think a decision in this case is clear, think again, because in 2021, a Supreme Court ruling included a concurrent opinion by Justice Gorsuch that said that with that decision, the court wasn't at that time making any implied guarantees that a right of private action actually existed. That means that at least the portion of the bench is open to hearing arguments to decide whether the right of private action in those instances actually exists or should be called non-existent. In the mean time, this decision will stand in a 8th circuit, a decision that was authored by a Trump appointee with the concurrent opinion of a Bush appointee. The only lone dissenting judge, a Bush appointee, was the actual chief judge.",subjective

But as it relates to the six or seven different conspiracies that they were running out of the Oval Office to overturn the 2020 election results, Mark Meadows was at the center of every single one of those. He was working with John Eastman. He was working with the attorney that Trump wanted to install as acting attorney general. I can't remember that guy's name, the nerdy looking guy with the glasses going bald. And he testified twice in front of the grand jury. And there's no privilege between him and Trump. Trump, you know, Trump could try to assert, you know, like executive privilege or executive communication privilege, whatever that's called. I can't remember off the top of my head. But I know that's been litigated a bunch as well. Never from that, there's no privilege. Meadows was not his attorney.

Ouch! Listen to this. Marjorie Taylor Green came out and said we played the sound yesterday that she's like, I'm not voting for any budget bill, no continuing resolution, nothing that doesn't involve the defunding of Jack Smith's special counsel office and everything that he's doing. Do you feel similarly about that issue as you do to defunding the FBI and the ATF and the DEA, etc? So George, when I was teaching law school, I learned and taught certain constitutional principles. When Marjorie Taylor Green was teaching CrossFit, she learned a whole different set of values, evident because my idea of what this country should be like is based on the Constitution, and she sees the world differently. She's criticized me for voting to certify the election in 2020. The Constitution says Congress shall count the votes. Doesn't say Congress may overturn an election result, it doesn't say Congress can do whatever the heck it was with this election, shall count the votes. That's what the Constitution says. In her CrossFit class, maybe they didn't cover that. And the Constitution also says that the impeachment of a president shall be based on trees and high crimes misuse. It doesn't say it's a political exercise and we hope that it does the right thing. And so I get tired of people.

The best tickets to all the areas sporting events and junkets to the world's great golf destinations, food and drinks on the house. Access to private jets. In the congressman or senator could take his favorite people from his district. The congressman or senator could take two dozen of his favorite people. Was all that legal? At times we didn't care. Abramoff targeted Vols and offered him a job. You're the chief of staff of a powerful congressman and Jack owns you. And you haven't even left working for the congressman.

Everything that we want, they're going to do. And not only that, they're going to think of things we can't think of to do. Subverting the essence of our system. Absolutely right. But our system is flawed and has to be fixed. There are lots of things in Washington that would seem to be illegal, but really aren't. If you know your way through the loopholes. When Congress passed the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, it plainly stated a member shall convert no campaign funds to personal use. But soon afterwards, Congressional leaders quietly invented something called leadership packs, political action committees that were not technically campaign funds. And thus exempt from the personal use for the prohibition. This is a loop hold. Right. Certainly every congressman and senator has a leadership pack, not just the leaders. It's like a political slush fund. That's exactly what it is. It's a political slush fund. Over time we've had them. They've been outlawed. They spring back in new guises. This is the latest guise. Senator John Edwards used his leadership pack to pay his mistress, Reel Hunter, $114,000 to make a campaign video. In Republican congressman Andrew Crenshaw of Florida, spent $32,000 hosting a tour of California wineries for a group of contributors from the defense industry, which he has some oversight. The Federal Election Commission is called the level of abuse substantial. When folks are asked for campaign donations and when they make campaign donations, I don't think they have any idea that some of that money is actually going into the members' personal bank account.

When those in power are not held accountable, the consequences can be disastrous. And when citizens try to speak out against these abuses, they are often met with violence and oppression. But why does this happen? Why do governments become corrupt and abuse their power? The problem with government is that it attracts those who seek power for its own sake.

I never met him who didn't know anything about it except what I'd seen on TV. Love this reality show, right? Didn't know that at all. That's all changed, thank God. This is what I did with this and what has never changed about Donald Trump that pivoted me in that moment and it has never, ever changed. He stood in a room about this size. In that room, how many people in here, someone tell me, this is huge. 3,800. 3,800. Maybe it wasn't quite that big. Maybe closer to 2,000 people in that room that day. They had their cell phones, right? These were citizen journalists. I started with a tea party as a citizen journalist back when Obama had Obama hair. And I saw my country going down the drain and I didn't want any parties. I wanted to be a stand-home mom. I was married to a senator. I had a great life, had beautiful children. I said them around there. I told them around a park every day. Look at that human animal. That's the life I wanted. But they took it. They took that life. And I realized at some point, if I think I'm raising an army, there's going to be no country for my babies to fight in once I have my army raised. And that's the moment where that all changed for me. And that was the moment I came out and took part in founding the tea party movement. So this president, so I'm a very heartfelt citizen journalist, right? I didn't have professional cameras like I do now at Real America's Voice. I didn't have lights and speaking engagements and all that. All I had was my phone. And I watched this man Donald Trump.

@nessadiosdado_video_7264763099108887850.txt," Did you know that after losing the Civil War, thousands of Confederate soldiers left the United States and settled in Latin American countries like Mexico, Brazil, Honduras, and Venezuela? Oh, Civil War, the South was in shambles. They were suffering economically and enslaved people were freed. Some Confederates were wanted, others could not stand the idea of living under Yankee rule, and many still wanted to enslaved people, and they were willing to cross the border to live their dream lives. Confederates like Matthew Fontaine Mori made plans in advance to colonize with tens of thousands of southerners and they're enslaved people in foreign lands. The amount of southerners who actually left foreign lands will never be known, but it was enough to catch the attention of the media and highly ranked Confederates like Robert Lee, who opposed it. In Mexico, there were many settlements, but the largest one was in September of 1865, which was midway between Mexico City and Veracruz. The town was called Garlota, and it was a part of the new Virginia colony plan. Families there could purchase 640 acres each, and each acre cost them $1. Single men could buy 320 acres each, and within a year the town reached at least 3,000 southerners, many of which brought their enslaved people with them, because while slavery was illegal in Mexico at that point, P&H wasn't. The town's prosperity was short-lived, which forced the settlers to move elsewhere in Mexico or back to the United States. Brazil was the Latin American country that attracted the most Confederates because up until 1888 slavery was legal. In fact, Brazil was the last country of the Americas to abolish slavery. Here is an actual picture of one of the Confederate settlements in Brazil. Confederates initially settled in Sao Paolo, and many were able to buy acres for less than a quarter each. Their descendants are still waving the Confederate flag. They have intermarried and speak Portuguese now. They have an annual festival that still celebrates their Confederate history. Over the years, the descendants have faced criticism over their showing of the Confederate flag, and they've had historians, students, Americans, and vacationers visit them.

They're demanding a amendments that threaten a woman's access to abortion. They're demanding amendments that roll back LGBTQIA plus rights. They're demanding amendments that undermine diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The freedom caucus doesn't care about freedom when it's a woman's freedom to make their decisions about their own bodies, or someone's freedom to love who they want or be who they are. Or people's freedom to not get shot at school, or at a grocery store, or at a mall. America needs to understand who the freedom caucus is and what they stand for. They do not care about your freedom. They care about their own freedom. They care about their freedom to do whatever the hell they want to do. And looking at how extreme most of the Republican amendments are that were made in order, I'd be surprised if this bill could even pass the House. I fear what this final bill is going to look like because of the amendments they are making in order today. This is honestly a disaster. And I have never ever wanted to hear lectures about process ever again. Well, Mr. Speaker, before I light up the Republican conference for an absolutely awful process that made a series of offensive amendments in order to block some very reasonable amendments, I do want the record to reflect that I have the deepest respect and affection for the gentleman from Oklahoma. He always sounds reasonable in part because he is a reasonable person. Unfortunately, he is surrounded by members who are not reasonable, who are not rational, who are not fair. For the second time this week, Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee was unexpectedly called back at 11 o'clock last night. We then sat and waited over an hour for the meeting to actually get underway, all because Republicans couldn't get their act together. Republicans had to have yet another backroom meeting, another midnight seance to resurrect this rule. Because it does not so far write MAGA wing nuts, once again, through a fit and hijacked the bill when they realized they weren't going to get a bill that was perfect to them. It should go without saying, but it's outrageous that a tiny minority of Republicans is getting to dictate exactly what amendments come to the floor. It's outrageous that the Rules Committee last night managed to mess up a bipartisan bill and put it on a path toward becoming a hyperpartisan one by loading it up with every divisive social issue under the sun. And here's my word of wisdom to Republican leadership. When you have a razor thin margin in one half of one branch of government, you don't get your way on everything. Democracy means compromise. Divided government means compromise. And compromise means you don't get everything you want. There has to be a give and take. And I have to admit, I have never, never, in all my time here, experienced in NDAA process is outrageously bad as this one. This bill passed out of the House Armed Services Committee by a vote of 5821. Let me repeat, it passed with a bipartisan vote of 5821. You know, when I was chairman, Democrats made an order over 650 amendments. Democrats made an order over half of all amendments submitted because we believed in the radical idea that we ought to. And I don't know, actually do our job and debate things. And Republicans in this NDAA have made an order fewer than a quarter of all the amendments submitted. In fact, despite a record number of amendments emissions this year, they made an order fewer amendments than every Democratic-led NDAA. And what's worse, these are the worst of the worst amendments. They block dozens of dozens of common sense ideas, but they paved the way for the most radical amendments. And in the rule that we are considering today, they made an order 70 Republican amendments, six bipartisan amendments, and get this drumroll please, one, two, three, four, four Democratic amendments. Now, some of these amendments made an order were submitted minutes before we held our markup. And for all my Republican friends who ran in rave about how important it is to provide enough time for members to read and understand what they are voting on, we had minutes.

@nowthisimpact_video_7329995006754737451.txt," I had a mother last night come up to me here in Tampa, Florida after the debate. She told me that her little daughter took that vaccine, that injection, and she suffered from mental retardation thereafter. Some of you might not remember who that is, and no, she's not another Maga rep or some rogue school or director. That's Michelle Bachman, a former congressperson and tea party celeb. And as she sounds like today's Maga chorus, it's because they're singing from the same book of him's. So how did the tea party pay the way for Maga to take over American politics? Well, let's rewind to 2009. America elected its first black president, Brock Hasein Obama. And the historic movement ignited a wave of political backlash for a thing, the tea party. A movement fueled by not so subtle racial undertones. They hated Obama. Because old Hasein here, bailed out the banks, homeowners, and the auto industry, but it didn't matter to them. Because beneath the banner of fiscal conservatism, the tea party's narrative was actually riddled with racist rhetoric, which laid the groundwork for a more blatant inclination via the lack of movement. And here is that Obama in 2008 was a symbol of hope. The tea party realized was that they didn't actually have to do anything. They just had to make sure that the ho didn't turn into action. It was a realization as powerful as it was dangerous. Because culture wars became the tea party's unexpected battleground. I'm trying to achieve a nationwide abortion ban to pushing for abstinence on the education. Its social policy maneuver set the stage for Maga's later more aggressive cultural crusades. Take the rhetoric around the Affordable Care Act, for example. Both groups loved hating on Obamacare. But neither could even come up with the draft of a plan B. Maga is basically the same script just with the different cast. The seats of conspiracy, sewn within the tea party's birthrism, blossomed into the Maga's movement's signature. Birthrism, by the way, for those that don't remember, was the baseless claim that Obama was secretly a Kenyan Muslim, which was rooted in nothing other than the fact that he was, you know, black. This wasn't just racist, Islamophobic, and xenophobic. It was a masterclass, in repeating something over and over again until people believe it. Which fast-forward to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we saw the exact same playbook. Ignore the facts and believe the hike. The Tea Party's art of obstruction turned into Maga's mantra. Its mutual distaste for politics as usual, brewed a perfect storm in which creating chaos trumped pun intended, any real policymaking. And that's because policymaking would have created solutions and solutions would have eliminated the madness that fueled its entire movement. Now another similarity between the Tea Party and Maga is that they were, and quite frankly still are, widely impopular. According to the Pew Research Center in October 2015, only 17% of Americans supported the Tea Party. And in March 2023, NBC found that only 24% had a popular view of Maga. So the Tea Party, the GOP's OG band Renegades, penned the started chapter for the Maga Sada. Its legacy was in just a political side show, but a shift in the GOP's soul. The party paved the way for Maga. Tea Party's louder, brashier sequel. It's like a created monster, one that swaps suits for red hats and political debates for cultural wars. And that my friends is how the Tea Party paid the way for Maga to take over American politics.",subjective

I criticize CPS and bad police every day. No one gave me a license. No one could stop me from videotaping in public.

It is the freedom to express your political beliefs that the Constitution of the United States protects at the highest levels. It is the highest standard to meet. If you want to stop somebody from making a political statement, the courts will ask you, what is your justification and it better be damn good. Usually it falls. For example, you can have a rule that says there's no lawn signs allowed in this neighborhood or in this town. Some towns you can't have any lawn signs of any kind. That's okay. But if you say you can't have political lawn signs, that's a problem. Because that violates the expression of the people and you're singling out content. It gets very complicated.

The US Supreme Court today remade the legal landscape, throwing out the precedent laid down 50 years ago in Roe versus Wade. The landmark 1973 Roe-V Wade decision held that every pregnant person had the constitutional right to decide whether or not to continue their pregnancy. However, another case, 1992's Planned Parenthood versus Casey, allowed states to pass a range of limitations and restrictions. These discriminatory obstacles fall hardest on black, indigenous, and other people of color, people with disabilities, young people, undocumented people, people in rural communities, and those having difficulty making ends meet. As abortion restrictions have expanded in scope, states that impose abortion restrictions and made the substantial healthcare inaccessible have had much higher rates of maternal and infant mortality, which has been especially pronounced for black women. With Roe being overturned, 26 states and three territories are expected to immediately ban or move to enact legislation that would be an abortion.

@riseupequality_video_7266943925410073898.txt," So far this year, the American Civil Liberties Union is tracking a record number of anti-LGBTQ bills. It's actually easier to track the number of states that haven't introduced anti-LGBTQ bills from those that have. There's only four. Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, and Delaware. I'm Katie Balevik and I cover LGBTQ issues for Insider. The overall trend shows how right-wing lawmakers and mass are targeting the queer community. Texas leads the way targeting freedom of speech, access to health care, what kids can talk about in schools. Missouri follows with 48 bills. Then Oklahoma with 35. Iowa has 29, Tennessee has 26, and the list goes on. Some states are copying each other's anti-LGBTQ bills, creating a national framework of laws, making it increasingly difficult for the LGBTQ community to just exist and live. Attend school, work, participate in extracurriculars. There are dozens of bills across different states targeting specifically the trans community and drag queens, people who dress up in drag. For example, a drag queen story hour, which are essentially a pretty toned down way for young kids to interact with the LGBTQ community. Down came the rain and washed the spider out. It's not a provocative experience. It's just kind of helping them gain some familiarity and see, okay, these are people. This person might look different from who you would see on the street every day, but this is a person. There have been efforts in a variety of states to target the ability for young people to get access to gender affirming health care. In Georgia, a state that has leaned purple and blue in recent elections, they actually managed to pass an anti-LGBTQ bill that was preventing young people from accessing gender affirming health care, which includes surgeries as well, as just hormone therapy. So it's very much a selective targeting of who can use what kind of medical interventions and for what reasons. Together we will keep Texas the greatest state. Texas, Governor Greg Abbott has encouraged his citizens to report parents who have trans children and let those children live as they are. They want citizens to report those parents for child abuse, which is a very serious charge and has caused some families to flee the state with their kids because they want to have a safe place for them to grow up and not feel targeted. A lot of it falls under the guise of protecting children, so they will say that they're protecting children from permanently mutilating their bodies. They'll say they're protecting children from material that they find to be pornographic, and they've used that as a reason to ban books, talking about sex and gender, ban conversations about it in public. They want to pull books off of bookshelves. There is a distinction between lawmakers who are really passionate about their anti-LGBTQ beliefs. A lot of them are based in religion. There are others, I would say, that are just kind of going with the flow and following the votes. The Trump era definitely kind of kick started the anti-trans targeting. Trump announced in a series of tweets that transgender people would no longer be welcome to serve in the military. Now, a few years later, there's so much more of a national movement and you have lots of different Republican governors pushing these laws. Governor DeSantis really, I think, led the charge with Don't Say Gay, with that legislation, and it picked up, and once they see that kind of success in one state, they're going to do it in another state. And that applies for a variety of different types of laws, whether it's about LGBTQ rights or abortion rights or talking about American history and race in schools. When they see something be a real flashpoint for conservatives in one state, a lot of times it'll spread like wildfire. There are definitely groups that are also lobbying to try and push this type of legislation forward. There are about 60 anti-LGBTQ groups that are identified as hate groups by the Southern Property Law Center. And that goes beyond just whether or not they think that members of the LGBTQ community should have basic rights. It's specifically promoting disinformation, pseudo-science, really damaging tropes about the LGBTQ community. A lot of these groups are tied to religion. Many of them have Baptist groups in the name. These bills and this overall movement has had a devastating impact on the mental health in the LGBTQ community. Some 40% of LGBTQ youth have reported seriously considering suicide. Those numbers increased drastically for people who are trans and non-binary. Some of the people who have said that they have considered suicide seriously or attempted suicide cited anti-LGBTQ sentiment and laws and bills as a reason for it. The rest of the year for the LGBTQ community is going to likely look like members of a protected class living in fear. The Department of Homeland Security has actually said that the LGBTQ community is at risk of being targeted by domestic terrorists. We had five people killed at the club Q shooting in Colorado last year. So there is a very real threat of extreme violence against members of the LGBTQ community. On top of the day-to-day threats of if you're a parent of a trans child are you going to be reported for abuse or if you're a drag queen performing a story hour our police going to show up, our protesters and proud boys going to show up. And then when you look forward to the elections it's likely that this type of rhetoric will continue.",subjective

Who knows the most information about Donald Trump's crimes and his state of mind? Who, if they testified against Donald Trump, could do the most damage to Donald Trump? And I would have answered you immediately. In fact, I did talk about this. I've been talking about this for a while. The answer to this for me is very, very simple. One person jumps out. Mark Meadows. Now we have learned that Mark Meadows has cut a deal with the special counsel, Jack Smith, to testify against Donald Trump in exchange for a grant of immunity. Now, I don't know the complete contours of that agreement. What exactly it means for Mark Meadows and possible criminal charges against him in the future at the federal level. Remember, he has already been indicted in Georgia. So he is facing those various, very serious crimes in Georgia. He has not been indicted as if yet in the federal case.

And anything that is bad for Donald Trump is good for America. Now, one thing that I read in some of the reporting yesterday in this immunity deal news is that Mark Metta supposedly said that he never heard Donald Trump actually say that he knew the election was stolen. And this is important because this goes to Trump's defense. And I use air quotes for that because for a lot of these charges, it's really no defense at all. But Donald Trump's defense that, oh, I did, I really believed that the election was stolen. I really thought I won. Therefore, I didn't have the requisite intent for this crime. Now, number one, I've told you that's a bogus defense. It's actually no defense at all to most of these charges because whether or not you believed, whether or not Trump believed that he had won the election is completely irrelevant. Even if he thought he won the election, that doesn't give him a right to commit the crimes that he committed. Like, for example, obstructing an official proceeding of Congress, right?

The morning of January 6th, shortly after 11 a.m. and I know the phone rings, the operator says, please hold for the president. What did he ask you? What did he say to you when he came on the line? I picked up the phone and the president asked me where I was on the electoral count. It would take place that day. And I told him, despite what you issued last night from your campaign, Mr. President, I've been very clear. And I don't have the authority to reject votes during the electoral count or return those votes to the states. And it went downhill from there. President became very rite on the phone. He said that if that was true, that he made a mistake five years ago. You write that the president told you you will go down as a wimp. And you reminded him of the oath that you both took. The president often said that we need to protect the country. And I reminded him we both took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. I told him it was a promise that I made to the American people and to Almighty God. Did you ever point blank, say to the president, I will not do this. I will not intervene. We lost this election.

@saj.wglw_video_7330435637067271467.txt," House Republicans are about to move forward with an impeachment resolution, but it's not an impeachment of President Biden. A meeting has been going on all day today of the House Homeland Security Committee. Lawmakers are preparing to take a final vote late tonight and if that vote is successful, which it's expected to be. Articles of impeachment for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorquez will be referred to the full House of Representatives for high crimes and misdemeanors. This is the first time in almost 150 years that the House has tried to remove a member of the president's cabinet through impeachment and wait till you hear the story of the last guy that went through it. He's a real peach. I'm gonna tell you about him in a second. But first, let's talk about Mayorquez. You may be wondering, what crimes or misdemeanors has he actually committed? Well, according to the draft articles of impeachment, Mayorquez will fully and systematically refuse to comply with federal immigration laws and he's guilty of breach of public trust by knowingly making false statements to Congress and obstructing the oversight of his department. Republican say Mayorquez is responsible for the chaos happening at the U.S. Mexico border and hasn't been following the laws. Secretary Mayorquez has testified in front of this very House committee several times and it's been, let's just say, heated. Today, ahead of the committee's meeting, Mayorquez fired off this scathing six-page letter where he pushes back on the committee's claim that he's not enforcing immigration laws. He says that is false. He goes on to say this administration has actually removed or returned or expelled more migrants in three years than the prior administration did in four years. Then he lists all the actions the Homeland Security Department has taken at the border and all the actual numbers of migrant expulsions. His letter acknowledges that, yeah, the immigration system is broken, but Mayorquez says the only way to fix it is for Congress to pass some new legislation. He then goes on to say he's been working with that bipartisan group of senators to do just that. He's been part of that big border deal that I told you about in this video. It's a deal that the House speaker has said, even if it does pass the Senate, it's dead on arrival in the House. Republicans are now saying no new legislation is needed to correct what's happening at the border. So now what? Well, the committee will take a vote tonight to move the impeachment articles for Secretary Alejandro Mayorquez forward. Then it will go to the full House for a vote in the coming weeks, whether it will pass the House is a whole different story. So yeah, Republicans have the majority in the House, but as I told you in this video, because of the Republicans who are no longer in their seats, the House GOP has only a two vote margin. Obviously, no Democrats are going to vote for the impeachment of Alejandro Mayorquez. That means the House speaker can only lose two Republicans to no votes if he really wants this impeachment to pass. That is going to be tough. And even if it does somehow pass the House, the Senate will never convict him. Oh, and by the way, this is going to take weeks, weeks spent on this instead of other work. But if the Republicans are successful in this impeachment, it would be the first time in almost 150 years a cabinet secretary has been in peace now. This is the story I've been waiting to tell you. The last time this happened was May of 1876 when William Belknap, then, wore Secretary for President Ulysses Grant, was impeached by the House for corruption, apparently. He received $20,000 in kickbacks from a trader that he awarded a government contract to. So how did Congress figure it out? Well, apparently, Belknap wasn't hiding it. He loved to show off his wealth at parties he was hosting in Washington and both. His first and second wives loved the luxury items and were always dressed to the nines. And people started to wonder, how the hell was Belknap affording such a lavish lifestyle and is $8,000 a year government salary? In the end, the Senate failed to convict Belknap of the impeachment. So he was impeached by the House, but not convicted in the Senate. He was acquitted and he was not prosecuted any further.",subjective

@sevr0rising_video_7219539535393279278.txt," So freedom of speech. That's the next topic we're going to cover. Tennessee right now is in a really shit position, especially considering everything that's going on. So what is freedom of speech? You look it up, it's going to say a principal that sports the freedom of an individual or community to articulate their opinions, ideas without the fear of retaliation, censorship or legal sanctioned. Freedom of expression interchangeably is recognized as a human right by the UN. And a freedom of expression includes any activity of seeking, receiving, imparting information ideas regardless of the media amused. What that means is when Senado Conner, way back in the day, tore a picture of the Pope. That's freedom of speech. When somebody is out in corner saying, you know, everybody is going to hell holding a sign. That's freedom of speech. It's a very big deal here in the United States. But it appears lately that that is no longer an option. Freedom of speech is disappearing. Now to start with whether you want to look at the overall situation happening in Tennessee, they're ousting three members due to them standing with their constituents over gun violence. Right now, OU, in Norman has a shooting that's happening. Haven't been able to see what's going on on the flip side of it. But clearly guns are an issue. I am a gun owner. I do carry a pistol with me. That doesn't mean there's not an issue. The situation we're running into is which right takes precedence, the right of human life, the right to talk about it, or the right to own. The answer to that is all of them take precedence. But for people to be ousted from their position in the legislature for standing with their constituents is fucking crazy. Okay, freedom of speech is everything to this country. And that includes fucking drag queens. Whether or not you like them is irrelevant. Right. The definition itself is an individual or community that wants to articulate an opinion. For anyone to block a community or an individual from expressing themselves, however they deem fit is insane. And it goes against basic human rights.",subjective

Can't even actually get a bill that would on a blanket level hold tech companies accountable for anything, namely meta and the damage that they have caused to an entire generation's mental well-being.

@sortasouthern_video_7203192293782801706.txt," If you're not going to like this, but I'm here to tell you that the South, the Confederate States did not lose the war. The United States of America just won the battle. I want you to look at the history of the United States post-civil war and really think about it for a second. We're going to distill a lot of information into a very small space and if anybody wants me to expand upon this, we will do so. The Confederate States rejoined the Union on their own terms. The only thing the South ceded to the Union was its right to own slaves. The initial concept of the Civil Rights Act was not passed. Abraham Lincoln was murdered. The South glossed over the notions of reconstruction and instead enacted and were allowed to operate for 99 years under their own racist and racially segregated bylaws that we call Jim Crow. Civil war ended April 9th, 1865. The United States signed the Civil Rights Act into law in 1964. If you look around today, do you see a United States? Or do you still see a country divided? Previously, the division of our country was somewhat geographical. They called it the Mason-Dixon Line. It was the North and the South. Our country is now divided along a political line, Democrat and Republican. But the ideas, the ideology, the principles of the Confederate States is alive and well today and it may not hold a popular position, American political space. It holds a pretty powerful position in our current American political space. Do not forget that just months ago, the constitutional protection against women's rights to bodily autonomy and medically safe abortions was removed. It is extremely easy to be dismissive of the Confederacy and the South and to proclaim that they lost the war, that they're losers and that it was a four-year, traitorous, treasonous run, all of which is true. But when I really sit back here and look at the history, it seems like the ideological demagogues of the South were playing chess. In the United States of America was playing checkers. And if we're not careful against the ideas and machinations of the Confederate ideology, we're going to see ourselves on the losing side of the war we didn't know we were even fighting.",subjective

This is going to be really hard for me to get through without laughing. I'm warning you guys right now. A vote was taken to remove Marjorie Taylor Green from the House Freedom Caucus for some of the things she's done. Republican Representative Andy Harris told Politico, adding that Green's support for House of Representative Speaker Kevin McCarthy may have also contributed to her ouster from the Hardline group. Harris declined to say how he voted but called the decision to remove the Georgia Congresswoman who is in her second, two-year term, and appropriate action. Well, that tells us everything we need to know about the Freedom Caucus, right? A club where Marjorie Taylor Green isn't right-wing extremists enough to stay in. Unbelievable. But after the news broke out, she put out this tweet. Only American citizens should be voting in American elections. That's why I introduced the DC Voter ID Act to safeguard election integrity.

The exclusive footage aired on Tucker Carlson's show, if you remember House Speaker Kevin McCarthy handed Carlson 41,000 hours of January 6 security tapes back in February, using footage of how some police interacted with protesters, Carlson says its evidence January 6 was, quote, mostly peaceful chaos, though his footage is just one angle. Previously our video documents the violence that took place on January 6, which resulted in 140 injured police officers and the death of at least four other people. Republican Senator Tom Tillis disagrees with Carlson's framing. I think it's bullshit. In the same way that Kinocha people, I remember vividly a picture on some news outlets that when we were seeing all the devastation in Kinocha, there was a building burning.

Moreover, police testify they at times feared escalating violence by engaging with the mob.

Tom Cruise's agent, Mahadekio, almost lost her job as an agent, but she did get fired as co-chief of Motion Pictures Department. A lot of people are currently comparing it to the McCarthyist era of the Cold War and the Hollywood Blacklist, but what does this mean? During the Cold War, the Hollywood Blacklist was designed to keep people out of the film industry, whether they deemed them to be communist or sympathising to the cause. It was tied with the House Committee of Un-American Activities, and it was originally designed to stop the spread of fascism. So 10 Hollywood figures, otherwise known as the Hollywood Ten, were called out for their ties to communism. They were imprisoned, and after they were released, they were blacklisted. It wasn't just these ten, anyone who had affiliations with them were them barred from the film and entertainment industry. Thousands of people who had affiliations or connections suffered setbacks to their careers. This suffocated creativity, it eliminated countless artists, and it changed Hollywood forever. It's Hollywood's collective desire to do what's best for the studios, and they'd rather leave collectives hanging dry. Think about what the WGA and SAG after it was striking for. The workers have always been the sharpest thorn in the side of studio execs. The execs don't want to potentially disrupt their bottom line and alienate movie goers. And since the Hollywood Blacklist, the anti-leftist sentiment continues in Hollywood and America today. Back then, any impact on an individual American was deemed irrelevant in the face of fighting the great threat of Russia or communism. But now instead of communism, replace it with being scared of saying words like genocide. This is why so many celebrities are scared to speak out. There is a concerted effort to punish anybody that speaks out about this ethnostate. Hollywood is willing to uphold their status quo in any way that they can. To maintain their imperial media hegemony, keep profiting and not disrupt their bottom line, and most of all, to continue their narrative to manufacture consent and justify their actions on their involvement in Palestine. Solidarity to everyone who's willing to put themselves on the line for this, and to speak up about these atrocities.",subjective

Tiktok CEO appeared in front of Congress to defend the app against claims that it's sharing data with China, messing with the algorithm to seed propaganda, or purposefully rotting all of our brains. Congress loves getting Tiktok CEOs in front of them to ask them questions, but as we've seen before, they're not necessarily knowledgeable about the specifics. For example, Tiktok doesn't sell data, it uses it to target ads. There's also no evidence that it's shared data with the Chinese government. However, there's also not a lot of hard and fast boundaries between Tiktok's parent company bytdance, which is based in Beijing, in the Chinese government. So it's really tough to keep track of where all that data goes. Now the government might try to ban Tiktok, which is already tried on successfully once under Trump's presidency. It could also try to force a sale to an American company, which the Chinese government has said it would oppose. Or it could pass comprehensive privacy legislation, which would force Tiktok to scale down its data collection. But it would also impact companies such as Google and Metta, who engage in the same types of ad targeting.",subjective

@texasscorecard_video_7187242756404727082.txt," It is 100% on us and we don't get to blame the Democrats. I'm Brian Slayton, I'm state representative, House District 2, which is Hunt, Hopkins, and Van St. Kent's. A lot of people have asked and also sometimes are surprised to know that Democrats serve as chairman in the Texas House and that's 100% true. We spend a lot of money in the general election to defeat Democrats. We a lot of narratives are written about how bad they are, how we don't want them in leadership. We don't want them to have the elected office, but yet in the Texas House, we literally give them chairmanship, which means they have more leverage and more power than they earn on election day. I don't think other members necessarily hide it. I think they just accept it. A lot of it is the legislature is treated as just a club. I mean, there's a lot of nice people. We have to hang out together and we go to meals and other things with each other a lot. So of course, they want to come lottery. And I think the Republican members don't want to mess that up. I think they're hoping that if the Democrats take over, the Democrats will make sure they're chairman, or they just want to have this persona as being bipartisan. The problem is what we lose while they're gaining the friendship, the bipartisan persona, and all that, we're losing good conservative public policy being implemented in our life. And I've been asked, you know, what conservative legislation is killed? Well, any is possible. Any on day one, because as bills removing, like I say, these Democrat chairman can say, hey, y'all have this important bill in these committees. Those are dead on arrival, because why? These are moving. And it just holds our bills hostage. And, you know, we don't get hearings on the Trump wall. We don't get hearings on banning in-state tuition for illegals. And on and on and on, we see problems. The CRT bill we had in the regular session got watered down by the Democrats. People say that if we don't allow Democrats to be chairman, then somehow we're going to look just like DC. Because when you see up in Congress, we're trying to win the House back. That's the talk up in DC. Guess what? If Republicans around the country show up and vote, and we have the majority in the U.S. Congress, we aren't punished with Nancy Pelosi's leadership. That seems like a pretty common sense strategy, common sense, you know, a result of a Republican showing up to vote. In Texas, you're about to see what, six or seven, eight, nine months, bashing Beto, bashing AOC, the Democrats, and Joe Biden's failed policies. But what they don't want to tell you is that if Beto was running for Texas House Representatives, he could be a chairman. Nancy Pelosi could be a chairman. All these Democrats they want a point to could be a chairman in the Texas House Representatives. So in a way, we look worse than DC. What does it say about our Republican leadership? That there are Republicans that instead of them becoming an actual chairman in the Texas House, they would rather vote to give it away to Democrats. Because there's 30-something committees. There's Republicans that are not going to be chairman in the Texas House. And a lot of members down there live for that title. Let me tell you, they live for the title being called Chairman. And the reason they're not is because they themselves vote and support giving the chairmanship to Democrats. It doesn't make sense to me or a lot of Republican voters why we do this to ourselves. And I don't really care if someone thinks we look like DC. We need to stand up for Texas period. And if that means making sure Republicans are the chairman, we should do that. So if this passes, if we wind up getting in the rules that only the majority party can be chairman, implementing conservative public policy in our lives has just increased dramatically. The second thing it does is it puts more pressure on us for Republicans. Because now we're not going to be able to say, oh, it died in committee or it died in the process. We ran out of time. We are literally in control of what's happening in that body. No one can mess up the plans by killing these other bills because they're a chairman. We literally are going to be in the driver's seat and the Democrats will have to fight as though they don't have the votes to stop a lot of things. So it has the potential for great things to happen in Texas, but it also puts way more of a burden on the Republican elected official and our leadership caucus chair speaker of the House. Because now if we don't pass these items, it is 100% on us and we don't get to blame the Democrats. Do you want to get your news from people who share your values? Texas scorecard.

@thealexdante_video_7193736348099038469.txt," Okay, let's talk about my card-dism. This is who the term is referring to Joseph McCarthy. He was a Republican senator from Wisconsin in 1950s and he had like one goal in his entire life and I was getting rid of communism in America and in his eyes everyone was a communist. I would probably accuse him first because I'm wearing a red t-shirt but he would accuse labor leaders, teachers, military officials and he would especially go after the Hollywood elite. Charlie Chaplin, he was a communist. And so was Lillian Helman, Dalton Turbo, Paul Robson and countless others. And a political climate of witch hunts against communists that McCarthy created did have real life consequences. Paul Robson was a prominent figure in the African-American community and he had his passport revoked just on the grounds of being accused for being a communist. It essentially ended his international career. And this is Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. They were executed in 1953 on the grounds of being communist spies. There was almost no evidence against them besides testimonies from people like Julius' brother-in-law David. So yeah, it got bad and of course those are only extreme cases but people in general lost friendships, jobs, marriages, they got blacklisted from certain communities all because of blameless accusations. But of course in 1993 my card is a bit of more than he can chew when he started to hunting non-communists in the army. The army did not take kindly to that. The army started pushing back and this led to the army McCarthy hearings in 1954. That was televised for millions of Americans to see exactly what type of tactics McCarthy used when he was making his accusations. They also saw the army officials and their chief counsel Joseph Welch respond to accusations in a calm and composed manner. This led to the public seeing McCarthy more as a bully and the Senate then voted to censure his conduct for being opposed to senatorial traditions.

Michael Bolton could testify, you know? And what a beautiful testimony it would be. He was blocking John Bolton from testifying among others and I was talking to this woman and she said like he's innocent, he's completely gonna see, he didn't do anything wrong.

At any moment, they could demand that all of TikTok's data be used to design an AI algorithm with the sole purpose of promoting Chinese interests and destroying our society from within.

There aren't exceptions for people who are going through a mental crisis situation for people who have a disability or for people who simply made a bad choice.

If you have done the work and taken the steps necessary to reconcile what you can and ask forgiveness, whether that forgiveness is granted or not, you have permission to forgive yourself. People love and accept you more when you love and accept yourself with all your flaws and to suggest that anybody should be doing anything else isn't pro-human, it's pro-censorship.

And this loyalty oath was a direct reaction to the Red Scar, aka the sphere of communism infiltrating America. Instead she went to work at a youth center to teach theater and at this youth center several of the board members were listed as communists by the government. So one thing led to another and she decided to put on a Elizabethan County fair that was part educational and part theatrical for her theater students to take part in.

@tiersofscrutiny_video_7327837363072257322.txt," Are you taking APS government in politics this year? If so, save this video for a required Supreme Court case that you'll need to know in order to get a 5 on your exam. Alright, so this case is called New York Times Company P-United States. Basically what happened is the New York Times tried to publish this set of papers or documents called the Pentagon Papers that outlined some of the United States involvement in Vietnam. Now for some APS context, for those of you who are taking APS or both at the same time, as you know, Vietnam was very, very, very controversial and actually we talked about it in the last case we covered Tinker Viedemoine. It was very controversial because we didn't end up winning or doing as well as, you know, the presidents were saying that we did, which is also why they didn't want the Pentagon Papers to get out even though it was Nixon wasn't part of the administration that was in Vietnam or any of the administrations who were in Vietnam. The Nixon administration basically prevented the New York Times from publishing the Pentagon Papers and used this thing called prior restraint. Prior restraint is when a government official or entity tries to stop the publishing of a particular piece of material or some particular piece in a news article or news outlet. An example of this would be let's say I become the president of the United States and I don't like that the New York, I get word that the New York Times is going to cover how I don't like cheese. I actually do like cheese. But let's say that was the case. Then maybe I would ask the New York Times not to publish that and try to restrain them from doing so, which would be prior restraint because it would be prior to the publication of the material. The Supreme Court has said that this is a big no-no because it's a violation of the first amendment rights of the company or the organization or the entity, the person who's trying to publish that paper. As you all may know, the first amendment really was created so that we had freedom of speech against government entities and prior restraint would be such a large huge threat to that ability to criticize our government. The justices said that security should not be used as a means to override the first amendment because the Nixon administration argued that they wanted to restrain it for security.

@tony.capitelli_video_7236591308662426923.txt," When I was working in conservative politics, a part took a bit in the Tea Party movement. The Tea Party was largely a reaction to Obamacare. Obamacare is of course not socialism, but conservatives lump it all together. Now it's one thing to oppose and protest against something, but like with Magga, the Tea Party was filled with anger, and I also had that anger. You wouldn't think opposing a social welfare program would generate that kind of vitri-haw, but this was obviously much deeper. So I grew up middle to lower middle class. My parents took care of me and I never really wanted for anything. They also wasn't spoiled and life since then has not exactly been easy. I bring this up because when you grow up this way, like most people, you don't feel privileged. And given how racial minorities and immigrants have been historically treated in this country, they've been marginalized and they're often the ones in need of assistance. So social welfare programs like everything else in this country are tied to race. See, the mindset is that life is hard for all of us and that no one deserves special treatment. So socialism is seen as a whole lot of special treatment. And the anger towards socialism is very simply from the feeling that you aren't being treated fairly.

When it started, the Tea Party was like a last stand against some terrifying progressive utopia. But I don't think anybody really expected it to turn the tide completely. And then they won, and they took back Congress, and they realized that on their words, defeating the establishment was possible. And that gave them a ton of energy. And they now knew that they could win on the things that they believed in. And so when Mitt Romney lost, that was intolerable. Fast forward then to Trump, and he made everything possible for them. Even something that most never really thought they'd be able to touch, and that's Roe v Wade. Now they want to complete the mission.

Let's talk about the layers of an image. If you're a fan of drag, you're familiar with the phrase drag is political. If you're not a fan of drag, you might not understand what that means. Some people think that drag is just pretty close and prancing around, and while thankfully a lot of it is, thank God. But many times through these close-up performances, people are able to make incredible political statements. Since drag is a performance art, a visual art, and there's an entertainment aspect to it, and it's, you know, someone's physical body. Drag queens are able to make images and statements that just aren't possible in any other art form. Cut to RuPaul in this dress when she was playing the drag queen Rachel Tension in two long-food things for everything, Julie Neumacher. The first layer of this image is, ah, black man, Confederate dress does not mix. This is the most shocking layer, so this is usually where a lot of people just stop. They just go, oh my God, Confederate, bad, black person should not be around Confederate nothing. But that's not their only layer. The first image of drag is never the only layer because drag is self-aware, and it's aware of what they're doing, and it's aware of how other people are going to perceive it. RuPaul did not wear the dress because she's the fan of the Confederacy. She didn't wear the dress because she wants the self to rise again. That's not why she wore the dress. She wore the dress to say, your little symbol means nothing to me, and I'm going to wear no one's going to be my ass. She knew racist white people. We're going to see this and just be confused, even the fact that the Confederate flag is in the drag space is taking the power out of it, taking the piss out of it.

I thank my friends here who have been for a long time making clear to the American people that it's time for things to change in Washington. Now, we've been saying that for a long time and finally January we did something about it and we forced to change and the American people responded. And for five months that change was being seen because we were a unified Republican party standing up for the things that we actually run on. Actually trying to change this place, actually trying to secure the border, actually saying that if you're going to raise the dead ceiling, maybe you should actually enact fiscal reforms to do so. We did that. We worked in good faith. Everybody's sitting around working around the table to accomplish the objectives, the American people sitting here to do. Unfortunately, last week there was a breach. There was a breach in the structure that we agreed to put in place to make sure that we are representing the American people through this here to four United Republican Conference. The Republican Conference right now has been torn a sunder. And we are working hard to try to put it back together again this weekend by making sure that this bill gets stopped. I want to be very clear. Not one Republican should vote for this deal. Not one. If you're out there watching this, every one of my colleagues, be very clear. Not one Republican should vote for this deal. It is a bad deal. No one sent us here to borrow an additional $4 trillion to get absolutely nothing in return. But at best, if I'm being really generous, a spending freeze for a couple of years, that's it. That's about what you get. And frankly, you're going to make things worse and my Democratic colleagues know it. That's why they're supporting it. That's why they're going around gleeful. There's a reason our Democratic colleagues support this. There's a reason that Mitt Romney supports this. There's a reason that Bill Crystal supports this. It's all the same stuff. There's a reason that our conservative allies are opposing it. Roundly, the club for growth, scoring against it, the Heritage Foundation, scoring against it, freedom works, scoring against it, Ron DeSantis publicly opposed President Trump said he thought we should default rather than pursue this kind of lunacy. At the end of the day, the only person that would default in this town is Joe Biden unless Republicans default on the American dream by voting for this bad bill. That is why this group will oppose it. We will continue to fight it today, tomorrow, and no matter what happens, there's going to be a reckoning about what just occurred unless we stop this bill by tomorrow. There is a reason why 100 Democrats, none of which voted for our initial bill, is now forward. Why is that? It's because they got what they wanted. And Kevin McCarthy had done a good job speaking the language. His number one slogan is, National Death is the biggest threat we have to America. That's out of his words, then to pass this bill. The Biden McCarthy deal has been dubbed the Fiscal Responsibility Act. But in truth, there's nothing responsible about it. Make no mistake, this is the Fiscal Irresponsibility Act. We wanted to cut spending so much we would never have to do it. But we came together with the provisions of the limit-safe-grow bill to raise a debt ceiling by a responsible 1.5 trillion in exchange for some $56 trillion of cuts over time. Then, while we were not participating, without the participation of the Republican body, you have our own leadership. Come together and jettison drop, dismiss all the provisions of the limit-safe-grow bill and come up with what the Democrat position was three months earlier. Raise a debt limit with no conditions. This deal makes default more likely in the future. A true default is when you can no longer borrow, you can no longer service your debt, you can no longer meet your obligations, and this deal makes it more likely, with a $3-4 trillion increase over the next year and a half. Every Republican should oppose it, no Republican should vote to validate, affirm, and own Biden's agenda. And that's what this bill does. Well, we are focused. I'll let each member speak for themselves, but for me, I am focused on defeating this bill. What happens post that and the agreements that we have, we will decide once we determine the disposition of this bill and its finality. There are two paths here. Take up the bill that we passed. It's a good bill. It's sitting over the Senate. They can pass it and Senate the President. Second, Speaker McCarthy should pull this bad bill down. We should stop taking this bill up right now. I don't think he even has a majority of his own conference at this point. We'll find out later today. He should pull this bill down, and then we should do exactly what we're doing right now. We have COVID resisions. Right now, COVID resisions are in the bill. COVID resisions of $29 billion. They've already taken that in this bill, and they've swept $22 billion and just set it over to the Department of Commerce for play money. Take that money, take IRS money, and go tell Janet Yellen, you're going to pay every bill you need to pay, and we're going to sit down at the table and do the job for the American people. But don't tell me you're going to put me over a barrel for $4 trillion because you refuse to do your job. That is what Speaker McCarthy should have told the President of the United States. We are dealing with the bill right in front of us. You can talk to these folks and anybody else you want to after this press conference individually.

Yet, even in the face of this testimony that we have heard today and the testimony that came before it, our colleagues across the aisle impune the purpose and the necessity of this hearing, calling it a political sham, calling it a stunt, calling it theater, and they suggest that what we actually need to do is pass more laws. So as a former federal prosecutor and judge, I'll start today with a refresher on a few of the things that are currently illegal in the United States of America. It is illegal to traffic fentanyl in the United States of America. Human trafficking is illegal in this country. Theft is illegal in this country. Rape and murder are illegal in this country. What's more, the Department of Homeland Security has an absolute obligation to detain and remove those who enter this country illegally. We do not need more laws. We need a president of the United States and a secretary of the Department of Homeland Security who enforce the laws of this country. But what do we have instead an administration that has deliberately subverted the duly enacted laws of the United States of America that have deliberately defied the orders of course in this United States of America who have ordered and directed that they de-sist these unlawful policies. We have an Department of Homeland Security that has defied inquiries from the United States Congress. And as for the 27 appearances of Secretary Alejandro Miorquez in front of this Congress, not one of those times, did he admit that we have lost operational control of our border, that we have ceded control of our border to the Mexican drug cartels, or acknowledged the scope, scale, and crisis that our communities all across America face as a consequence, as a direct consequence of these lawless policies. Every single time an individual is allowed to enter this country unlawfully, Americans are less safe. Ms. Noble's, Mrs. Dunne, as a mother, I see my child and my family in those photos that you shared with us today. And it is truly something that we cannot fathom, the loss that you have each suffered. I thank you for your willingness to come here today and share with us your stories. I would like to hear your perspective, please. On what more, Congress could be doing to support you and to try to prevent this type of unspeakable tragedy from happening in the lives of another family. We'll start with you, Ms. Noble's. I would like to see every illegal immigrant who comes to come here to be properly embedded in background check. I hear a lot about more funding resources and all that. How is that going to help them do their job in the first place? They failed Kayla by not checking her murderers' background and did not make that one phone call. One, one phone call could have saved my baby's life. They didn't. And after he was arrested, they put some child protective services to come and put him in an unsecured children's home with other children. And I know Americans commit crimes on other Americans, but why do we have to take other countries trash? Why do we need them? Ms. Dunn? We talked about a lot today about more resources at the border. And I appreciate that and I respect that. But I don't think that members in this room and other rooms at the Capitol understand that we are actually at war. And we're at war with the cartels. We're losing our children. We're losing a generation of children. We're at war. We need our military at the border. That's what we need. We don't need more border patrol. We need our military at the border. Stopping the drugs. Stopping people from coming in. They can't come in. We're full. We're closed. That's it. No more money. No more. No more sandwiches. It's closed. I'm sorry. Come through the proper challenge channels. I am a first generation American. My parents both migrated here. Guess what? They did it legally.",subjective

@yapandcheese_video_7277990642960108831.txt," I want to connect a couple dots of a lot of things that are happening in political current events. Kevin McCarthy and other spineless Republicans are initiating an impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden, despite the fact that they know that Joe Biden has not formed impeachable offense. Well, why is all this happening? Within Congress, we have a little group called the Freedom Caucus. They are often taunted as a fringe party within the Republican Party. However, what I like to call them is the people in the Republican Party who are willing to say out loud that things are public and say they are high-closed doors. If you have ever heard of the paradox of intolerance, when we tolerate intolerant parties, the intolerant party will do everything they can out of desperation to gain more power and consolidate it into their hands in order to eliminate their opposition. AKA, the tolerant. And in this scenario out loud, these people have claimed that as immigrants, LGBT people, and non-Christians. So I just want to frame that for you real quick. What does this have to do with the impeachment inquiry? Well, in order to consolidate this power, they have to continue to make sure that they completely eliminate any trust that we, as people, have more public institutions. Which granted, with the way they've been going, they're doing a great job. Because the Justice Department has done these investigations into Trump, because Trump was impeached on valid terms twice. And because there are tons of indictments against Trump and his little, um, uh, co-conspirators right now, uh, the Republican Party has no choice but to double down and support their frontrunner by completely using these same avenues, um, as political theater to try to make you distrust them because they're not going to find anything in Joe Biden. And they want you to just think that any impeachment thing is whack, right? They just really want you to think that any kind of investigation to a president is whack. If you can do it, we can do it too. They want you to feel like all this stuff to vilify Trump is invalid. Which obviously is not the case. I also want to draw your attention to the fact that Project 2025 has been a very big topic here on TikTok. If you're not familiar, there are a bunch of conservative thinktakes, specifically the Heritage Foundation, I'd like to focus on today, that craft a lot of the legislation that gets brought in through Republicans and the Freedom Caucus here in the United States. Uh, and yes, I'm telling you that Marjorie Taylor Greene is not writing her own, uh, policy. I know that that is shocking to you. Um, but this is all to say, they and a bunch of other conservative thinktanks as well as some congress people, some academic scholars, etc have outlined their plan of how they would like to completely, uh, so distrust in our institutions eliminate the, um, federal bureaucracy would like to completely deregulate the economy and ultimately destabilize our lives as middle to lower class Americans and also people with marginalized identities. Uh, if you think I'm joking, they very much want to establish a christo fascist regime here in the United States and they want to consolidate power into one authoritarian president. This is not a lie. They have this all outlined in their multi-step plan of how they like to do that. And the steps that they're taking right now are all a part of this plan to continue to so doubt in our institutions. So if this is something that you want to learn more about, I suggest you look up project 2025. Um, and I also suggest that we all get a little bit more savvy looking at what the Republican Party is doing and not completely diminishing the tactics that they're using as just political theater because they are actually sowing the steps right now to continue to try to get a Trump presidency or any Republican presidency in order to establish a christo fascist regime here in the United States. Anyway, consolidate a little three-minute spiel. Wanted to let you know that that's going on. Wanted to help you kind of sew together how all these things connect.

Then they really hit the jackpot because over the next four days they were able to excavate an Allysor, a Stegosaurus, and a 120-foot-long sauropod.
