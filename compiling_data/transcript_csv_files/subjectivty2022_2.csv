We as a society need to petition the U.S. to follow international law and settle international disputes peacefully and not at the cost of innocent lives. So why exactly are these sanctions harmful?

@fncischen_video_7290746310234426670.txt," From the perspective of geopolitical risk consulting, how does one plan their career given both Russia, Ukraine, conflict and the Israel-Palestine conflict going on right now? First, from a humanitarian perspective, I do want to express my condolences to both the Israeli and Palestinian civilians that are caught in the middle of the crossfire of this major conflict. And I hope that the Israeli and Palestinian governments have a ceasefire so that they can address this major conflict in the appropriate diplomatic channels. The big fear that I have is that many countries in the West, the US, the UK, much of the EU, if they go ahead and participate in this major conflict in a ravine, there could be a potential of World War III because Iran is very interested in this conflict. Saudi Arabia is interested in this conflict. Much of the global South is watching, saying, no, we do not like what's going on. That being said, I think it's important to position yourself, I think like a business owner, even if you are an individual contributor or a manager at a beer company. I do see a situation where there could be more economic inflation, oil prices increasing, as this conflict is going to basically affect energy markets, which is going to affect the price of goods in many countries in the West. Most folks in the West have rolled should really consider some sort of positioning themselves in a digital economy where they're client-based, they're customer-based, they're employers that they work with. They should be a strong emphasis of working remotely or transitioning to working remotely. Because the reality is that you might be in a position where you might have to relocate in case war breaks out. Let's say I want to start failing, I want to start a business for something I really love, but the cost of living is too high where I'm at because of this war because it's conflict. This is where you have to think, wait, what are other markets outside of the West and the global South that I can access? What is my global network? My personal professional network that I can reach out to build relationships with, have win-win partnerships with. The reality is that in the West, the US, UK, the EU, the only standing industries that are going to be able to sustain itself are going to be defense, healthcare. Maybe some AI, maybe some logistics, but other industries have to make more money to offset the cost of inflation. That's in healthcare are the only two industries that can absorb the high costs of labor and goods due to the fact that they are essentially funded by the government and not everyone works in those industries. I believe it's important that to have a plan B, regardless of who you are, in the case of where war does break out and there's major geopolitical conflict, and you're like, hey, there's some things that I really want to do, but I can't do it due to the existing macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions in my home country.",subjective

@paulicy_music_video_7347792354549583150.txt," I don't know if you guys know. Bricks is sanctioning the United States and Israel. Let's forget about TikTok being banned. America being sanctioned. Run that video, comment below. And this is for educational purposes only. What do you think about this, America? Run that video. Waves through the international community. The Bricks nations, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa have collectively announced economic sanctions on Israel and the United States, signaling a dramatic shift in global diplomatic dynamics. The decision to impose sanctions in support of Gaza, Palestine, reflects a bold stance by Bricks, an influential group of emerging economies, and carries significant implications for geopolitics, the Middle East peace process, and the principles that govern international relations. Before we start, please don't forget to like and subscribe to our channel for more updates. The longstanding conflict between Israel and Palestine with its roots deeply embedded in historical, religious, and territorial disputes has been a persistent source of tension in the Middle East. The situation in Gaza in particular has been marked by recurring bouts of violence, humanitarian crises, and complex geopolitical considerations. The international community has grappled with finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict, and Bricks' decision to impose economic sanctions marks a critical development in the ongoing quest for a just and lasting solution. The decision to sanction both Israel and the United States is noteworthy as it underscores Bricks' collective commitment to addressing the broader geopolitical context surrounding the Israel-Palestine conflict. While Israel has been a focus of international scrutiny for its actions in the occupied territories, the inclusion of the United States and the sanctions indicates a clear review of Washington's policies and actions in the region, particularly its unwavering support for Israel. The economic sanctions announced by Bricks are expected to have far-reaching consequences, trade, investment, and financial transactions between Bricks, nations, and Israel and the United States are likely to face restrictions, potentially impacting the economic well-being of these nations. The move reflects a willingness by Bricks to leverage its economic influence as a tool for promoting diplomatic change, challenging the conventional notion that economic sanctions are primarily the domain of Western powers. The Bricks nations, often characterized by diverse geopolitical interests and priorities, have found common ground in their support for the Palestinian cause. This unity speaks to the evolving dynamics of global diplomacy, where traditional alignments and alliances are subject to shifts based on shared values, regional concerns, and a desire to shape a more equitable world order. China, as one of the Bricks members, has increasingly asserted its role as a global economic powerhouse and diplomatic actor. The country's economic influence, paired with its long-standing commitment to a multi-bola world, positions it as a key player in the Bricks decision to impose sanctions. China's growing role in global affairs is reflected not only in its economic clout, but also in its willingness to take a stand on issues of international significance. Similarly, Russia's involvement in the decision to impose sanctions underscores its desire to play a more prominent role in shaping global narratives. The Kremlin's geopolitical maneuvering, especially in the Middle East, has become increasingly assertive. The decision to support Gaza through economic sanctions is not only a reflection of Russia's stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict, but also a strategic move to enhance its influence on the international stage. India, with its historical ties to Palestine and its aspirations for greater global influence, has also aligned itself with the Bricks decision. While navigating complex relationships in the region, India's support for the economic sanctions sends a signal of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. It reflects a nuanced approach by India to balance its strategic partnerships with various nations while upholding principles of justice and international law. South Africa's participation in the decision to impose sanctions carries a unique historical context. The nation, having overcome apartheid and transitioned into a democratic society, understands the significance of international solidarity in addressing issues of injustice and human rights violations. South Africa's involvement in the Bricks decision aligns with its commitment to global justice and equality. Brazil, with its growing economic influence and aspirations for a more prominent role in global affairs, adds another layer to the collective decision. Brazil's involvement underscores the idea that emerging powers, when united, can exert significant influence on the world stage, challenging the traditional dominance of Western powers in shaping global narratives. The impact of Bricks' decision to impose economic sanctions on Israel and the United States goes beyond the immediate economic repercussions. It sends a powerful message to the international community about the shifting dynamics of global power and the emergence of alternative voices in diplomatic discourse. The move challenges the notion that major global decisions are solely the prerogative of a select group of Western nations, marking a departure from traditional power structures. The decision also raises questions about the role of economic sanctions as a diplomatic tool and their effectiveness in achieving political change. Bricks' move suggests a belief that economic pressure can influence the behavior of nations, a strategy traditionally employed by Western powers. Whether this approach will yield the desired results or further entrench existing positions remains to be seen, but it adds a new dimension to the ongoing debate about the efficacy of economic sanctions in international relations. The reaction from Israel and the United States to the Bricks sanctions is likely to be complex. Both nations have historically resisted external pressure on their policies in the region and the imposition of economic sanctions by influential emerging powers poses a significant diplomatic challenge. Israel, in particular, may view the move as a betrayal by nations it may have considered potential partners or neutral observers in the complex Middle East landscape. The announcement of sanctions is likely to intensify the already polarized global discourse on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Supporters of the Palestinian cause are likely to view the Bricks' decision as a positive step toward justice and accountability, while those aligned with Israel may see it as an unwarranted interference in the region's internal affairs. The diplomatic fallout may further strain relations between Bricks nations and the Western powers, adding complexity to an already intricate web of alliances and rivalries. As the global community grapples with the implications of Bricks' decision, the United Nations, as the primary international forum for conflict resolution faces renewed challenges. The Security Council, where both Russia and China hold veto power, will likely become a focal point for diplomatic maneuvering. Efforts to forge a consensus on the Israel-Palestine issue, already hampered by historical divisions, may face additional hurdles as Bricks nations assert their influence on the diplomatic stage. The announcement of economic sanctions by Bricks in support of Gaza-Palestine is a landmark moment in global diplomacy. It underscores the emergence of alternative power centers and challenges the traditional narrative that has long dominated international relations. The decision sends a clear message about the importance of justice, human rights, and the pursuit of a more equitable world order. As the geopolitical landscape continues to evolve, the impact of Bricks' decision will reverberate far beyond the immediate context of the Israel-Palestine conflict, shaping the future contours of global diplomacy and the principles that govern the international community. In the aftermath of Bricks' announcement of economic sanctions on Israel and the United States, the diplomatic landscape witnesses a seismic shift. The ramifications extend beyond the immediate context of the Israel-Palestine conflict, impacting global alliances, regional stability, and the efficacy of economic tools in shaping geopolitical outcomes. As the international community grapples with this unprecedented move, several key considerations come to the forefront. One of the immediate concerns is the potential ripple effect on the Middle East and its fragile geopolitical balance. The region, already marred by multiple conflicts and power struggles, now has to navigate the consequences of Bricks' decision. The dynamics between traditional allies and adversaries may be redefined and the move could contribute to reshaping alliances, potentially leading to a re-evaluation of strategic partnerships in the region. The reactions from other major players in the international arena become crucial in understanding the full impact of Bricks' sanctions. Western powers, notably the European Union and the United States, are likely to respond with a mixture of concern, criticism, and strategic recalibration. The imposition of economic sanctions by a block that challenges the established order prompts a reassessment of global power dynamics and the traditional levers of influence.

Go get a pin, go get a pad, cuz class is now in session. So as we look into the state of the world right now, we understand there's three entities. Actually, there's way more than that, but the three that everybody is understanding at this point, we have Russia. We have NATO and we have Ukraine, right? So in my opinion, Russia has completely overplayed their hand. Completely. Let's look at the Russian market. Right now, there is no Russian market right now. There's actually clothes and shut down at this time. Within the last 36 to 48 hours, the economy in itself has dropped 40 plus percent. It's probably closer to 45 percent because of the acts of aggression and also the sanction. Keep in mind, these ain't nothing but economic sanctions. What sanctions you ask? I guess you don't even worry about it. All they are are laws designed to block, to ban, and to restrict trades from either a country, or a group of individuals that does not comply to foreign policies. Write it down. What does that all mean though? Alright, let me break it down a little bit further. What it means is we're fitting to put the press on you. You cannot move. The credit that you've got you ain't got trash. The money that you got that you've got you had right there? Trash. Worthless. Ultimately, I'm boxing you in. And if that ain't enough, I'ma continue to put a little bit more pressure in lean on you. I'ma start affecting your water, treatment. I'ma start affecting your food. I'ma start affecting your medicine. Anything that is essential for humans to survive in your country until you get to with the program, I'm leaning on you. Write it down. You see what I mean when I say Russian might have overplayed their hand, what they thought was Ukraine was just gonna go ahead and lie down. But they didn't. We've been a lot of help right now. So if you look at NATO and itself, NATO is winning in every statistical category. Anything that comes to as far as troops, as far as aircrafts, as far as tanks, as far as everything, etc., etc., money, everything, everything except one. And that is the kicker per se because Putin is more irritated right now. So what does he have? More of the NATO? Nuclear weapons. That's why Putin for real was talking real greasy. That's what he was alluding to. He said he know what anybody that come through thinking they finna slide and try to help Yombo over here. Yombo finna see some real action that Yombo finna see some real action that Yombo finna see. Yombo finna see some real action that Yombo finna see. But how does that affect you and the market? What should your mind be on at this time? If you play in the market, your number one thing should you should be thinking about? Our commodities. Commodities. That's what you need to put your focus at this point. But keep in mind, bro, this ain't financial advice. So make sure you're doing your own due diligence on everything that I've said.

@thisiscory_video_7294843444638354730.txt," When it comes to our foreign policy, I believe we should strengthen relations with Israel. I think they will be a crucial ally to us in the Middle East.

Well, I have a certain fondness for the Israeli people. They have a strengthen that I resolved that I admire. And I believe it is our duty to help protect those people in that dangerous region. Not to mention we have congressional elections right around the corner. It wouldn't necessarily be the worst thing in the world if the Jewish people here in America found out that I was the first US president to sell weapons directly to the state of Israel.

However, under no circumstances, are you all to be developing nuclear weapons in Israel? Whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down, Kennedy. Okay, you know me better than that. We're not developing nuclear weapons over here. We're developing a nuclear reactor for energy and peaceful purposes, man.

I couldn't hear you just now. What did you say about bye? Bye. You saying you're bye? Are you coming out to me, bro? What did you say? You know damn well you hear me. I'm not budging on this, okay?

You guys can come and look at the front part and the break rooms and stuff like that. I want by annual inspections and I want to see the whole goddamn facility from top to bottom. Okay, listen, clearly you're upset. I can hear that. Why don't I call you back in a few months and we can get this thing sorted out? Okay, fine. Got it. Damn it.

@lisaremillard_video_7358641693111012654.txt," It looks like we are going to get another TikTok ban bill in the House of Representatives. This one totally different than the one the House just overwhelmingly passed last month that the Senate is now considering. This one is new as of today. Now, this is going to get a little complicated here, but I need you to stay with me so you fully understand what's going on. So at this point, tonight, right now, the details of all of this are still very vague. But House Speaker Mike Johnson announced earlier today that he is going to try and move four separate bills, but then wrap them all into one big package. Three of the bills would be four and eight bills for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. And then one bill would have several conservative national security priorities. And this alleged TikTok ban bill would be snuck in there. The Speaker says he wants to move this package by the end of this week. Now, let me be very clear. At this hour, the Speaker has not unveiled any actual text of these four bills. So I cannot tell you, nobody can tell you what any of them specifically say or what they would specifically do. But what I can tell you for sure tonight is lawmakers on both sides not happy with this plan. Far-right Republicans are pissed because, one, they don't like big packages of bills like this, two, because they don't want to see any forward to Ukraine and three, because there's no explicit border policies included in this proposal. In fact, if the Speaker moves on this package, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has threatened today that that would trigger her motion to vacate. So she's been saying all day that she has the support she needs to get Mike Johnson fired as Speaker of the House. Now, on the Democrat side, some say they want aid to Ukraine and Israel and Taiwan so badly that they're willing to vote separately on this plan that the Speaker has come up with. But others hate this idea, because they say the simplest path is for the House Speaker to just put that massive overwhelmingly bipartisan $95 billion for an aid package. The Senate already passed on the House floor for a vote. Now, on top of all of this opposition, there are also some real technical and logistical hurdles the Speaker would have to overcome to even get these proposed for bills to the floor this quickly. This is going to move fast, though. So I'm going to keep you posted as we learn more.",subjective

And hey, yeah, let's lift the embargo. All for that. But I can say that without blaming the failures of socialism on the embargo. The revolutionaries wanted to take away Cuba's dependence on America. They were completely fine with the embargo happening. In fact, they saw it as a good thing. They knew it wasn't going to hurt them because they side trade agreements with countries like the Soviet Union and China. These countries more than covered the losses incurred by not being able to trade with the United States. This proves that the many problems that Cuba had throughout the next three decades after this were not because of the embargo. You didn't really see the effects of the embargo until after the fall of the Soviet Union. Venezuela didn't fail because of sanctions either. It doesn't make any sense to claim that because Venezuela was failing before the sanctions. Maximum number of daily calories that can be purchased with a minimum wage in Venezuela.

@crisisalgorithm2.0_video_7202301124165143854.txt," WikiLeaks released thousands of documents and files that it says expose hacking tools used by the Central Intelligence Agency. The leaks purportedly show that the CIA is capable of hacking smartphones, computer operating systems, automobiles, messenger applications, and even internet-connected televisions. The series of files, dubbed Vault 7, consists of 8,761 documents and files allegedly from the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence. Though many of the tools detailed in the documents are the kind of things you'd expect from an intelligence agency, they provide an unprecedented blueprint for how the CIA could hack individuals they're spying on. Here's how they could work. The CIA operatives are investigating a suspect in France, we'll call John. According to the leaks, CIA hackers operate out of the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany, using it as a base to cover Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. From the confines of the consulate, the CIA can track John's activities around France. The CIA purportedly has a few techniques it can use to hack into versions of Apple's iOS, the mobile operating system used in iPhones. The WikiLeaks documents detail malware allegedly used as a hacking tool that appears to remain on an iPhone even after it has been rebooted, a technique known as persistence. To gain access to phones and other devices, the CIA would exploit zero-day bugs, previously unknown flaws in the operating systems code, that they would collect and store. If the CIA hacks John's phone, it can bypass the encryption of messenger apps like WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, and can file that John uses and collect voice audio and messages before the applications encrypt John's text. To track his movements, the agency can activate the camera and microphone on John's phone without him knowing and retrieve his geolocation. Even if his cell phones powered off, the documents describe how the CIA can hack other internet-connected devices to monitor John's activity. Working with British intelligence, the CIA developed an attack that can place Samsung smart TVs in a fake off mode. So while the TV appears turned off, in reality, it's functioning as a bug and recording his conversations in the living room. The CIA also apparently has the capability to target John's wireless internet router to connect to his infected computer or access files. American CIA hackers can also allegedly leave false breadcrumbs to mask the operations fingerprints and make it appear that it was carried out by another country. That can be done by inserting malware components from a known Chinese, Russian, or Iranian hacking operation, for example, into a US one. There's evidence that the CIA has been collecting malware components known to work and oversee cyber attack operations. The CIA declined a comment, quote, on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents, end quote. But if authenticated, the trove would be one of the biggest breaches in the spy agencies history. The spokesman for the White House also declined a comment. The extent of the impact on US security remains to be seen. Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet Inc's Google have all said in statements that they've already addressed some of vulnerabilities. The other investigations were continuing.",subjective

In terms of its content, the draft is seriously out of balance and confuses right and wrong in terms of the approach.

I only wanted to say my distinguished PR of Israel, having a debate with Israel was not my intention. That Israel treats China as a rival. Either as a rival. You picked the wrong target, probably. You should be aware that from the very start of this round of conflict between Palestine and Israel, China has unequivocally condemned all acts that harm civilians in violation of international law. When we refer to civilians, they include both Palestinian civilians and those of Israel. Second, regarding today's resolutions, you made some comments. I would like to remind you that just last week, this Council, there was a resolution before the Council which condemned elements, condemned hummus, attacks, China voted in favor of the resolution. However, that resolution was vetoed. But in my earlier statement, I made it abundantly clear that China is not denying Israel's legitimate concerns. However, we emphasise equal attention to the legitimate security concerns and legitimate rights of both Palestine and Israel in the current circumstances. China, we try to deal properly with this round of the conflict between Palestine and Israel. We cannot deny that the rights of the Palestinian people have for a very long time not been properly guaranteed. And the only way out we believe is the two-state resolution, but that has not been properly settled.

@general.discharge_video_7195800027841809707.txt," The CIA Global Response Staff operates in the shadows like no other. Aside from a few events, this entity has stayed out of the headlines and public for quite some time. While its specific tasking and scope of operations is classified, the GRS trains teams to work undercover and provides an unobtrusive layer of security for CIA officers and high-risk outposts. In a nutshell, you could see these guys are some pretty badass bodyguards for CIA personnel and VIPs. GRS operators are highly trained in a variety of skills such as surveillance, counter surveillance, close protection, and weapons handling. Since the Global Response Staff is a highly trained protective force, its primary responsibilities are to map escape routes from meaning places, pat down informants, and provide an envelope of security. All while accepting the fact that if push comes to shove, they're going to have to shoot. One such instance that was highly publicized was the 2012 Benghazi attacks, which resulted in the death of four US nationals. Two of them being Global Response Staff personnel. Former Navy SEALs tie-run woods and Glendale were to pay the ultimate sacrifice defending the US Embassy and compounds that were attacked that night. Due to the dangerous and intense environments that the GRS operates in, its personnel generally consists of former Navy SEALs, Rangers, Green Berets, Recon Marines, and Afspec War personnel. Roughly 125 operators are working abroad at any given time and rotate through cycles of training and off-time backstates side. GRS operators are either full-time CIA officers or contractors who do a few months abroad at a time. Due to the level of risk that CIA case officers carry on their counterterrorism assignments, the Global Response Staff has become a critical component of conventional espionage. In fact, they've become so important that the CIA had to overhaul its top secret and legendary training program known as the Farm. To teach it spies the basics of working with GRS teams. Both the agency created the GRS to protect officers in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan. It has been expanded to protect secret drone bases as well as CIA facilities and officers and locations including Yemen, Lebanon, and Djibouti. Additionally, sometimes GRS teams provide security for personnel from other agencies, such as NSA teams that deploy sensors or e-stropping equipment and conflict sounds.",subjective

@britisharmydocs_video_7173678215737740549.txt," On the 2nd August 1990, at 2 a.m. local time, Iraqi forces invade Kuwait in overwhelming numbers. The Emir, Sheikh Jabir Ahmed Al-Saba and his family, escape to Saudi Arabia by helicopter. His brother is killed amid heavy fighting around the palace in Kuwait city. Iraqi troops have invaded Kuwait and are reported to have taken over the capital Kuwait. The military success of the Iraqi invasion was never endowed, but the Kuwait armed forces were no match for the might of the Iraqi army, the fourth largest and among the best equipped in the world. But why did the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, decide to invade the small oil-rich shakedom on his southern water? Iraq itself has massive oil reserves, second only to those of its huge southern neighbor, Saudi Arabia. And with oil representing over 90 percent of its exports, the immediate source of conflict with Kuwait lay in the falling price of oil. Kuwait, the Iraqis claimed, was pumping oil at a rate which was directly contributing to the slump in world oil prices. In addition, while Saudi Arabia had agreed to write off the billions of dollars it had loaned Iraq during the eight years of war with Iran, but had drowned to an inconclusive halt in 1988, Kuwait refused to write off its loans, also running into billions of dollars. Other long-standing areas of dispute with Kuwait included the shared wealth of the huge Rumeilia oilfield, straddling the border between the two nations, and the sovereignty of the two Kuwaiti islands, Warba and Boubian, which effectively control access to Iraq's only major seaport, Umkasa. Underlying all of these issues, however, was the desire of Saddam Hussein to enhance his standing in the Arab world. He saw the prospect of swift and certain victory over a small and vulnerable neighbor as a means of demonstrating his domination of the Gulf region. And he banked on the conflicting interests of the Soviet Union and the Western powers, blocking any effective action by the United Nations as they had done so often in the past.",subjective

It created the Security Council, which has 15 members. Five of those members never changed. China, France, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The Security Council adopts resolutions with a substantive resolution. Any of the five permanent members can block it. That's called the veto power. When there's a veto, the issue goes to the General Assembly, where there's a seat for all members of the United Nations. The General Assembly can make recommendations on collective measures for peace, but unlike the Security Council, its resolutions are not binding. The United Nations is headed by its Secretary-General, who has what's been called the most impossible job on Earth. It includes trying to get peace talks going, save lives, and stop the war.

No, they learn English because English is the language of power. We live in an imperial world dominated by one global superpower and that superpower speaks English. Therefore, people learn English. Non-native speakers learn English to align themselves with power. They know that learning English will help them gain access to certain socioeconomic circles that they might otherwise not be privy to. In fact, a study commissioned by the British Council of five poor countries, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Cameroon, Nigeria and Rwanda, found that professionals who spoke English earn 20 to 30 percent more than those who didn't.

These are the countries accusing Israel of genocide. Turkey literally was the first country to commit genocide in the 20th century. It was really the end of the Ottoman Empire turning into the Turkish Republic, but the Turkish Republic was founded in 1923 on the genocide of Armenians, which every Turkish government census denied, the ethnic cleansing of hundreds of thousands of Greeks. Greeks speaking people from the Black Sea region, the Aegean region, parts of Anatolia, that were ethnically cleansed in 1923 to make an ethnically pure Turkish Republic. If that wasn't enough, in the 1940s, the Turkish Republic instituted an ethnic tax on non-Muslim minorities, where Jews, Armenians and Greeks had to pay more than 100 percent in tax. Armenians had to pay 232 percent tax on all of their wealth, meaning that if you were an Armenian in the 1940s in Turkey and you owned a house or a business or whatever you owned, all of that 232 percent tax on that, and if you couldn't pay, you were sent to a work camp. It's called the Varlek Vargiszi. Look it up. Was that ever judged in an international court? No. Did the victims of those work camps ever get reparations? No. And it gets worse. In 1955, the September events, the Turkish government literally sponsored a pogrom, a riot in Istanbul, where Turkish nationalists rampaged through the streets and attacked ethnic Greek businesses, even forcibly circumcised Greek men in the street, Essade Greek women in the street, rampaged through businesses, caused millions, the equivalent of millions of dollars in damages and forced emigration of Greeks fleeing the city. In 1955, Turkey was never held accountable for that. What about the Kurds? Turkey is literally waging a war right now against Kurdish nationalists. There is no Kurdish state. Where is free Kurdistan? For decades, it was illegal in Turkey to publish a newspaper in Kurdish, to have a radio broadcast in Kurdish, to learn Kurdish. Is Turkey being held accountable for their war on the Kurds? Had the international court of justice? No. Venezuela, a bismill human right situation, journalists and opposition activists are jailed, tortured. Saudi Arabia literally has the death penalty for gay men and women. Being a gay man, being a lesbian woman, being trans is criminalised. Gay people are actually executed.

Iran that has been imprisoning and torturing and really unaliving protesters over the last two years, students simply disappear. Disappear.

@codepinkalert_video_7008234280342015238.txt," If you've ever wondered how the United States actually sells weapons to other countries, I'm going to try and do my best to explain it pretty simply and generally. There's a whole component of arms dealers that all include in a different video, but generally, arms sales can go from private companies in the US to other countries, or from country to country. So first, the company and the country where the two countries will enter a period of negotiation to make a deal. What does this country need, how much they willing to pay, etc? After a deal is reached, the State Department is required by the arms, export, and control act to notify Congress about the sale. After the notification is received by Congress, Congress has 15 to 30 days to introduce and pass a resolution of joint disapprival to block the sale. The difference between 15 and 30 days is based, it just basically depends on how closely the United States is with that country. So like Israel and NATO countries have 15 days for Congress to block the sale, and then other countries have 30. If Congress doesn't block the arms sale in those 15 to 30 days, then the State Department issues the export license for whatever is being sold to that other country. Now, if you even have a general idea of how Congress works, you may notice that 15 to 30 days is not a lot of time for them to pass something. So it makes it hard for Congress to stop arms sales. However, just because Congress couldn't block an export license doesn't mean the arms sale can't be stopped. Up until the weapons are actually delivered to that other country, Congress can introduce new legislation to block an arms sale. Just to give everyone a specific example, in early May Boeing made a deal to sell Israel $735 million in laser guided missile systems and bombs. On May 5th, the Congress was notified about this. There was a joint resolution of disapproval introduced. It wasn't really introduced in time to pass, so it didn't make it through. Then of course, the export license by the State Department was issued for the Boeing sale to Israel. But just recently, AOC introduced an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that, you know, months after this export license was issued, if this amendment was passed in the NDAA, would require the Biden administration to block this Boeing sale to Israel. So there's a lot of avenues for Congress to block an arms sale, but a lot of them have a hard time being successful. That was a very basic explanation of how arms sales work and how Congress is involved. And I'm going to keep making videos explaining different aspects of the US arms trade, so stay tuned.",subjective

And they're just about a year old, but they've been targeting telecon companies and BPL companies and even stole legal legend source code from Riot Games. But they essentially just called an employee, used a little bit of charisma, held them on the phone for about 10 minutes and ended up downloading a malware device after being able to log into their computer because they hacked it from that sent employee. Which ultimately shut down the majority of their slot machines, which just came back on today, but also allowed them to access and steal tons of data that they are threatening to leak. And in return, they are asking for massive ransom. Caesar Palace actually ended up paying about 15 million dollars to these guys, who are supposedly 19 to 22 year olds that live in the US and UK and are straight up just doing a modern day ocean 11 heists on these casinos. Now I'm in crypto and I've seen tons of fishing hacks and people losing all of their money to the scams, but I had the opportunity to interview Richard Ring who is the founder of F3 Intelligence, who is worked with the top intelligence agencies in the world. And while your devices are actually pretty well secured, there's a lot of things you can do just to prevent them and make sure you're taking the extra steps and initiatives to not get scammed. One is I know at least a few of you of this watching have the most simple passwords and you've probably been using the same password since like middle school. You should be changing passwords constantly. For sure, as hell shouldn't be using your same password for your banking as you do for Facebook. A second thing is going to be fishing emails. This is probably the most prominent that I have actually dealt with because I get a lot of impersonators who will ask for people's addresses, ask them to send them information. Do not send any personal information guys to an email address that you're not familiar with or have no idea where it's coming from. Because more than likely, it's going to be spam or fishing. Don't open the email from an unknown email address, trash attachments and unexpected emails and avoid risky clicks. Instead, type the address into your browser to see if it's real. And the last step, which I know is the hardest, is changing your phone number, whether it's every three to five years, just do it occasionally. This reason is simple, is because of spam calls and text and potential scammers just actually calling you doing the same thing they did to the lady at MGM. But with the millions of accounts that you've probably signed up for with your phone number, the more times that information has been released due to data leaks, which has happened with big companies like Facebook and Verizon. But no matter how long you've had that phone number, it's out there and the longer you've had it, the more likely it exists in multiple shady places and on multiple spam lists.

Seedings of that committee were held behind closed doors, but there was no consensus behind closed doors about what to do. Algeria, which is currently sitting on the Security Council, is a rotating member. In response to those committee meetings, it is going to formally introduce a resolution Thursday or Friday seeking membership for Palestine. As a legal matter, the people of Palestine have a right of self-determination, titles them to equal rights in the international community, which includes, if they want to join the United Nations, access to the venue of the United Nations, or to participate in the benefits of the UN membership. There is simply no reason grounded in international law why Palestine should not be a member of the UN. There has been the bipartisan position of the US for some time now that Palestine should not be a member of the UN. Meaning there is a significant chance that the US will veto membership for Palestine in the UN. The US position is at Palestine should join at the end of a peace process with Israel. There is a nonsensical, illogical position, because the point of UN membership is not to be a gift or a reward from the United States. UN is intended to be a forum for every single state to have access to a venue to talk, to be able to engage in dialogue, to convene formally, to resolve their differences and to build friendly relations. UN membership is what distinguishes the United Nations from the League of Nations, for example.",subjective

I mean, I got shot in the foot with a rubber bullet and other people were bludgeoned nearly to death and, you know, hit with the chemical spray and had long lasting lung effects. So we are now serving 21 defendants, Capitol Police officers, Capitol Police officials, like Thomas Tobias, and try to put together as much as we can, but this January 6th class action law. Now, this is about to be fun. He's filing a class action lawsuit against the 21 Capitol Police Officer because he said they use excessive force. Do you know why he was denied bond? Let's run this down. For two hours, he fought police officers. At one officer, he beat him with a shield. In another instance with an officer, he hit that officer 16 times with a baseball bat causing extensive damage to him. That's not even the worst part. The other reason he was denied bond was because he was forming a militia to attack the United States government, not from January 6th, on a inauguration day. He was going to attempt to hurt the president of the United States. It was being sworn in at it. And you can say, how the fuck do you know that prove your sources? This dumb dumb told the judge right in court and told the judge straight to their face that he would do it again if he had an opportunity to. He also said he doesn't answer to the United States of America. He doesn't answer to the court. He doesn't answer to the government. He doesn't answer to Congress. He doesn't answer to law enforcement. The only person he answers to is God. So go ahead. Try to tell the police that they use excessive force when you did all of that to them. Can't wait.

@cyber_warrior76_video_7295741384147881246.txt," Any happy Monday. So I wanted to talk about this here. So a lot bit. They have allegedly claimed that they have successfully branched up owing, which would be a significant victory for them. And potentially some harm for us as can Boeing provides a lot of contracting services for the department of defense as they have a lot of initiatives and different programs with our military. So this would be again pretty significant. So they haven't come up with any concrete information. I mean they posted Boeing as a list of victims on their leaked site. Sometimes they'll do this, but it could be from maybe a vendor of Boeing, maybe like a third party, but not the actual company. So it's kind of hard to say to they actually release the information to show any proof. And again, Boeing hasn't really commented on this. They've acknowledged the claim. And so what probably what's happening here within Boeing, they are more like an hour of our party activity. They're in some response. So usually this process here is you're trying to verify this claim. You're trying to look for any signatures over show data that's been exfilt out. So they're looking at network dogs looking for any sort of transport services. Anything that would indicate data is being exfilt out that's kind of way to verify this claim in addition to ways that I could see this could possibly happen is lock bit exploded what's called a zero day. And that would be a vulnerability and one of their software that has that is not known in only the ransomware gang knows about so they could have exploited it. Got into network and stole the data or could have been through a fishing email could have got through one of the employees could have been one through one of the third party vendors that are connected to the Boeing network of those are the two main ways. So we'll kind of keep on watching an update you on this is we get more information, but this is pretty significant. Nothing concrete. Everything's still alleged. I haven't seen any solid proof. But if they do this would be unfortunate significant victory for lock bit if they were able to do this.",subjective
@shawnryanshow_video_7339249157745675566.txt," We just had this supposed cyber attack yesterday. Yeah, supposedly 70 something thousand, AT&T customers, one out of loss forception. Team mobile took a hit, Verizon took a hit. Now they're saying a lot of pharmacies. Something happened with a lot of pharmacies where they took a hit. And first, it was just an outage. Is a Chinese solar flare? Yeah, that was Chinese. So yeah, but now they're reporting this morning. Everything I'm saying is saying that it was a cyber attack. And so this is something that, I mean, how do you prepare for a cyber attack? Have you thought about this? I have a lot. When it first happened, first thing, everybody was like, we get hit by EMP. Well, EMP is like, that's much different to cyber attack. Right? EMP is going to be anything that's actually, you know, function, like functionally operating machinery, except that it requires electronics is going to be shut down. So the thing about cyber attack is it could be much more targeted. It makes it much more dangerous because you hit somebody's infrastructure, but protect your own. And so everybody where everybody's worried about EMP's, but cyber attacks are much more tech, much more advanced and much more targeted. And so that was that was the first thing I thought happened right away when it seemed multiple carriers go out and it wasn't just those major ones. There was a lot of smaller ones too. Was all at one time. And it's like, and so right away, I thought, you know, this is a cyber attack. And it's coming out. And then they said, I joke about this Chinese solar flare because they said it's a solar flare. I'm like, oh, a Chinese solar flare. But yeah, I think this should be if we don't get enough wake up calls, right? But this should be a wake up call to Americans that yeah, to be prepared. The incompetence and lack of attention that people have paid to what is going on in this country is all coming to fruition right now. We're going to pay at price. The American people are going to pay the price of one. Do you think this is going to happen? You know, with the elections, almost with the elections coming up, two way, two or four elections coming up, almost, you know, the people say conspiracy, right? But I think the difference between a conspiracy sort of profit right now is about two weeks, right? Like give it about two weeks and it becomes, it becomes prophecy. But I say this and people, I'm not trying to scare people, but with the election year right now, almost think this people within our own government and political parties and political powers that want to allow something like this to happen this year. That's my personal fear. And I hope it's just a fear. But, but so this year is something that I could see something major happening in in the United States. I'm with you. I think it's going to be later though. Yeah. I think there's definitely a possibility. I hope so. Well, I mean, if you think about it, I mean, you know about, you know about war games and how they, how they do these computer simulations that will show, it will basically show the probability, the percentage of probability that you have to come out on top. It's a particular scenario where to happen. You know, right now we probably have the weakest administration that we've ever had in the country. Right. I mean, let's be, it just is what it is. It's not a political statement. That's, that's the fucking reality of what Americans have created in this country is the weakest administration that we've ever had. Why, if you were an adversary, if you were Russia or you were China, why on earth would you even consider making a move right now when the borders completely wide open when it's when it's, when it is, I mean, so easy to capture politicians through bribery. You know, I mean, it's all, it's right there in the open. All these politicians that have been bribed by Chinese spies. It seems, I know people care, but it doesn't seem like anybody's cared. So I bet, I guess what I'm saying is that this is a game of chess. These guys are just going to continue to make the right moves to get as much as you can right now and run the simulation. Say, maybe today, oh, we got a 65% that if we run a cyber attack on the US right now, we're going to wind up coming out on top. What can we do to improve those numbers? You know, right now is the time for them to be improving the numbers. Right, rerun the simulation. All right. Now we're at a 75% probability that we're going to come out on top. Let's run it again. Let's insert some more whatever, you know, let's, well, they're building infrastructure right now. Exactly. You know, and so they build, they take the recommendations from the simulation. They, they, they, they put it into motion. Then they rerun the simulation. It ups the probability that they're going to come out on top. When we do get a stronger administration, if that ever happens, who knows, that would be the time where they go, all right, we've done everything we could. We've had this week administration for how many years we've, we have taken full advantage. Now they're getting ready to this strength. And let's pull the trigger right now. Yeah. You know, and because then you have, you have strength, incoming strength that won't be able to. Right. Because they've been undermined right there. They're sitting on a single fold foundation of sand. That was, yeah, I personally think that's how I would do it. Sure. Yeah. That's, and honestly, that's why my fear would be this year because if they fear that they go lose the white house, when I say they go lose the white house, I mean, our adversaries go lose the white house because I think they have the white, our adversaries have the white house right now because of corruption and, and so if they feel like they're going to lose the white house, maybe they don't feel like they're going to lose it right now. And they feel like, and so they can play it out longer. What, what, when you talk about like what happened yesterday, I don't believe, by the way, we said it was like cyber attack. It was a cyber attack, but I believe that's more of a feasibility assessment type scenario. What you're saying there, let's, let's just, yeah, so yeah, let's see, because that's, that's what you do before you, you know, before game day.",subjective

But it's also packed with natural resources and minerals such as large reserves of gold, copper, diamond, iron and aluminum. And just off the coast, there is oil. Lots of it. Thanks in part to a recent oil discovery, Guyana is of course to become the world's largest per capita crude oil producer. You heard that right. But the geopolitics of this standoff is fascinating because Venezuela is strongly supported by countries such as Cuba, Russia, China, and Iran. All of these countries seek to gain a better foothold in the region and undermine the United States. So a stronger Venezuela helps their cause. Notably however, China does own a piece of the offshore oil find that Venezuela would claim in its annexation, so Beijing could oppose a conflict in the region.

@toputinperspective_video_7203818678192770346.txt," NATO has moved closer to Russia rather than Russia moving closer to NATO. Is that not an accurate way to look at this? I think that's the way you present Putin probably looks at it. It's certainly not the way that we look at it. You don't think that NATO has expanded e-sports toward Russia? NATO has expanded. And the expansion has been a good thing for you. So the reason that the Russian Army is at NATO's doorstep is not the fault of the Russian Army or not the Russian Army that's done. It's NATO has moved closer to New Zealand. This year it wasn't NATO who was ordering upwards of 15 battalion tactical groups to within 10 kilometers of border with Ukraine. I'm pretty sure it wasn't NATO who put little green men inside Ukraine to destabilize Eastern states. I'm not pretty sure that Ukraine is not a member of NATO. So unless that's changed. It's not. Okay. If NATO has moved east, the reason that the Russian Army is closer or on NATO's doorstep is because NATO is not a- NATO is not an anti-Russia alliance. NATO is a security alliance. And for 50 years it was an anti-Russian alliance. So if you do not understand it, you do not understand how, what can you not even see how the Russians will perceive it as a threat. And the fact that it keeps getting closer to their border while their troops, I mean, the places where their troops are, you say their troops are, may have been in Ukraine and Georgia are not NATO. I'm not going to pretend to know what goes in President Putin's mind or Russian military commanders. But I barely got a history degree at the University of South Florida. What I can tell you is that NATO is a defense of the lines. It remains a defense of the lines. Correct. I mean, that's just a fact. It's expanded. Right. Exactly. You're moving closer to Russia.

@americanspaceimperialist_video_7085883148965350699.txt," But, there's also another reason why Russia didn't join. NATO is not simply an alliance, it's a structured machine. When a nation joins NATO, it is not simply changing to the blue team. The way its military is organized becomes based around being able to work within that machine. A country joining NATO is a process that takes years. This isn't a process that simply happens. For one, a nation joining NATO has to be unanimously accepted by everyone. And it also has to be voted on by that nation's population. As an example, Hungary in 1997 voted 85% in favor of joining. Would the Russian people ever have accepted to join an organization that they believed was an arm of the American Empire? The rule of geopolitics is the closer you are to a superpower, the more they mingle and try to control your nation. And that's what Russia really views a lot of their neighbors as. Just pawns on a board for which they, as the stronger nation, have the right to control. Their goals in Europe simply drive others away from them. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. NATO expansion closer to Russia only made them more paranoid and isolated. However, if NATO didn't expand, who's to say what countries like Estonia might find themselves in right now? And clear Putin has some fantasy about rebuilding the Russian Empire. Or at least the influence of the USSR. This video is not about two equally bad camps. NATO's greatest sin, at least in this regard, is leaving its doors wide open. It's been said that Americans should imagine what it'd be like if Canada fell to Chinese influence. Complaining that your geopolitical rival lied about letting your former allies into their compass club doesn't make you look like a victim.

@richard_wolff_video_7204098431407688965.txt," For the 30th year in a row, the United Nations General Assembly voted concerning the United States embargo against Cuba. By the way, embargo is the old word. Nowadays we would call it sanctions regime or sanctions. The United States did to Cuba for the last half century what it is now doing to China and Russia and Iran and for the 30th year in a row they voted. And typically the vote was just like this year. Get ready. 185 to 2. 185 countries want the United States to end the embargo against Cuba. Two countries voted in favor of the embargo. One which will come as no great surprise is the United States which is imposing the embargo. And the other one is Israel. I won't make any comment. None is needed. Okay. Why do I bring this up? Because the vote is lopsided. Well, it is every year. Because the rest of the world believes that this is an illegitimate, inappropriate, wrong policy. Yes, I think Americans tend not to want to know if the rest of the world disapproves of something the United States does, even though it is very important and probably more so than ever before that we become aware of what the world thinks about us. Because if it thinks that way about the embargo against Cuba, guess what you should not be surprised at. That a majority of the countries in the United Nations wouldn't support the sanctions against Russia and China either. Because those kinds of sanctions often lead to war and partly because they are not a way to build a peaceful world. But let's be clear. The United States justifies the sanctions against Russia on the grounds that Russia invaded Ukraine. Okay, but that doesn't really make much sense because Cuba didn't invade the United States or anybody else. And it's got sanctions. In fact, the sanctions against Cuba began right after the United States invaded Cuba, not the other way around. When that Bay of Pigs, it was called the Bay of Pigs invasion by American-supported Cuban exiles, took place in 1961. It was followed by this embargo. Neither of them achieved their objective, which was to weaken and overthrow the Castro. It was a government. Okay, well, if embargo sanctions are done to weaken and overthrow a government in Cuba, maybe in Iran, maybe what's going on in Ukraine is really got less to do about the Russians invaded Ukraine and a lot more to do about a program that hopes to weaken and overthrow Mr. Putin and so forth in Russia than anything else. And it would lead me and I hope thinking people everywhere to ask the honest question, just as the UN wants to prevent war, military war. Why wouldn't it include that now to have also economic warfare, be just as outrageous? Most of the victims in military war are civilians by standards. And you know, in economic warfare, it's even more than. It's not the leadership of the country. It's not the government. It's not the people who make the policy. It's the mass of people who are victimized. It maybe is time to be honest about these things and to go with 185 who are against embargoes in Cuba, probably against them everywhere else and take the bold step of reducing the risk of war militarily by reducing the legitimacy of applying sanctions.",subjective

We've moved from a unipolar world where we dominated the planet to a multi-polar world where we can no longer dominate because we have two other great powers to deal with. The second reason is we behave in such a ham-fisted way that we alienate countries all over the world.

@cybersecurity.art_video_7278397080438132011.txt," I'm going to explain how the hackers got into the MGM brand hotels and who claimed responsibility. As you may know, there was a cyber attack on the MGM brand hotels a couple of days ago. MGM is a company valued at $33.9 billion. Over a dozen MGM hotels and casinos, shut down operations. The attack was actually aimed at getting a ransom payment in order to get everything back up and running again. Now, these ransomware attacks can demand tens of millions of dollars. Ransomware is a malware designed to deny user organization to their files by encrypting all of the data. They then ask for a ransom payment to decrypt all the files, bring everything back to the way it was. Usually, these hackers still leave a pack door into the system. The casinos don't want to feel embarrassed, so they probably won't admit to everything that happened. They're going to say everything is back to normal and we're still checking people in and everything is play A.O.K. but that's not actually really true. They are shitting bricks right now. Okay, so the outage impacted ATMs, slot machines, point of sale systems, restaurants, RFID room keys, Wi-Fi, and everything else that was on the grid. But that is on the grid, including MGM rewards mobile apps. The staff is still checking people in using a notepad and pencil. Welcome to the 80s, I guess. So the properties that were affected are ARIA, Bayou, Ravage, Bellagio, Borgata, Cosmo, Politan, Hotel in Las Vegas, Doulano in Las Vegas, Empire City, Casino, Excalibur, Luxor, Mandelae Bay, MGM Grand in Detroit, Las Vegas, National Harbor, Northfield Park, Springfield, New York, New York in Las Vegas, No Mad Las Vegas, and Part MGM, Oh, and the Vidara. The attack was claimed by a group called Alphv or Black Cat, who actually want a ransom payment from the MGM brand in order to decrypt all of the files that they've encrypted. So all of this was done using a social engineering attack, which is an attack that fools someone into giving sensitive information. It's kind of like reverse psychology. Apparently, these guys are known to be gifted with social engineering for initial access. They first went on LinkedIn and they found an employee who works at the MGM brand hotels and resorts in casinos. So then what they did was they called Help Desk and used social engineering tactics to have the help desk people or person give them sensitive information. Apparently, according to news articles like cyber news and hacker news articles, this only took 10 minutes. So then this was posted by the malware repository VX-Underground on Twitter, which is now known as X. Interestingly, this attack occurred just two weeks after the two largest cyber security and hacker events in the world, Black Hat and Defcon, which, part of events that I was actually at, to learn more about security. So yeah, those are pretty crazy events. Some of the biggest threats today are phishing emails, social engineering and security misconfiguration, which involves broken authentication. Be careful out there in the cyber security landscape in the modern age. Protect yourself by not clicking on random links in your emails. Verify your browser URL and email of the person to validate it's coming from the reputable company. Don't give your personal information to telemarketers as these are usually social engineering tactics. Make sure all of your devices and passwords are using multifactor authentication or at least two-factor authentication.

The warrior insights I talk about geopolitics and warfare on this channel, I need to go ahead and like, comment, repose and favorite this video and let's get it going. Here are the 5 reasons and under 60 seconds. 1. Promoting Global Stability After World War II, the US enacted a Marshall Plan which allowed Western Europe to rebuild and recover from World War II. 2. Fustrating Economic Development, which have stabilized and built up nations. For example, we did this in Korea and Japan right after their wars and both of those countries are thriving. 3. Countering Influences of other state actor groups. So we did this during the Cold War against the Soviet Union and we're doing this right now in the Middle East. Again, certain other countries. 4. Addressing Humanitarian Crisis, the US provided Africa a significant amount of relief to help combat the AIDS crisis. Reason 5. Advancing Diplomatic Goals and maintaining our legitimacy as a world's hegemonic power.

Biden administration announces new economic sanctions on hundreds of Russian officials and entities Friday in response to the Kremlin's illegal annexation of four regions of Ukraine. And here's what Joe Biden had to say about Putin's move. Make no mistake, these actions have no legitimacy. And he also said I urge all members of the international community to reject Russia's illegal attacks at annexation and to stand with the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes. And the new sanctions target several front companies outside of Russia that were created this year to help major Russian military suppliers evade the sanctions they had already faced. And the new designations also expand sanctions to top Kremlin officials to include their wives and adult children. I mean this was a response I was expecting from the Biden administration, but the first round sanctions did not really do too well. Yes, they hurt Russia but Russia still kind of heard the West pretty badly too. Improvings probably prepared for whatever sanction the US has.

McGee has faced 60 years of wrongful imprisonment in a case that ties all the way back to the persecution of George Jackson, Jonathan Jackson, and Angela Davis. McGee, 84 years old, spent almost all of his life since the age of 16 in prison. He was first arrested in 1955 and tried in a deeply racist Jim Crow era case in Louisiana due to his relationship with a white woman and spent roughly eight years in Louisiana's Angola prison. He was again arrested and railroaded in a Los Angeles case in 1963 over what was called a kidnapping over a $10 marijuana deal. He was bound and gagged by police during the trial and beaten so badly he was hospitalized for three days. McGee was the sole survivor of the Marin County Courthouse Rebellion of 1970 in which an armed Jonathan Jackson took over a courtroom to try and free his brother the revolutionary George Jackson. Rochelle happened to be in the courtroom as a witness and joined in. The police opened fire and killed Jonathan Jackson, James McLean, William Christmas, and the judge of the case. McGee was acquitted of the subsequent murder charges but found guilty of kidnapping. A massive hunt for Angela Davis was launched, falsely accusing her of supplying the weapons. She too was later acquitted after an international campaign. 53 years later McGee is finally going to breathe free air again. For decades he functioned as a jailhouse lawyer and political activist. Activists who helped to win McGee's release say he is a freedom fighter in his own right whose resilience inspires a new generation.",subjective

Mexican Army convoy is in a Navy ship, laden with food, supplies, and specialists travel to the United States, including doctors, nurses, and engineers carrying water treatment plants, mobile kitchens, food, and blankets. The convoy represented the first Mexican military units to operate on US soil since the Mexican American War of 1846, but rather than bullets, they came with aid. The majority of the Mexican military forces focused their manpower on cleanup and humanitarian aid to the hard hit states of Mississippi and Louisiana, specifically the hard hit city of New Orleans, which had thousands of casualties and damages totaling hundreds of billions of US dollars. Then Mexican President Vicente Foxx told former American President George W. Bush, in the name of the people and of the government of Mexico, I assure you of my deepest and most sincere condolences for the devastating effects caused by Hurricane Katrina, finishing off by stating that the United States would be provided with any kind of help that was needed. Additionally, Mexico also assisted the American victims of Hurricane Katrina by offering almost 200,000 tons of food at no cost.

They get more money. You see, when working in the US Foreign Service, and it's often similar when working for other countries as foreign service, you essentially get more money the more foreign a place you go. If you're serving pretty much anywhere in North America, Western Europe, Australia, and a few other assorted countries, you get no bonus. If you serve in a place that has an extreme climate, poor quality of health care, high crime, high pollution, or has any other factor that makes it more difficult to live there as a foreigner, you get hardship pay, which is a bonus that ranges anywhere from 5 to 35%. That 5% rate includes places like Costa Rica, the Bahamas, Malta, and Bulgaria, while the 35% rate is reserved for places like the Central African Republic, Somalia, Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. That rate of hardship pay can also vary within a country. For example, if you served at the US Consulate in Dubai, you'd only get a 5% bonus while serving at the US Embassy in Abu Dhabi would get you 10%. There are also some places that, well, just don't seem all that hard to live in, but do earn new hardship pay such as Pointe del Gata Portugal, a well known vacation destination. This is likely only included because of its isolation. On top of hardship pay, you can also get an additional bonus if you serve in a place that is deemed dangerous.",subjective

Does it target and hurt the country that's sanctioned or embargoes imposed on? Usually not. Other countries usually profits from it. Let's go back to the Carter administration. President Carter, they've been in embargo against the Soviet Union. This is during the Iranian deal. What happened? It stifled the industry out here on the river in about a year and a half, two years later. Thrages. Things called it up. It crippled the American former. It triggered a lot of negative economy effects here in the United States. Other countries was by an American grain re-routing it to the Soviet Union. However, it was American companies that were selling directly to Russia through other networks. We really showed them didn't we?

So, the United Fruit Company teamed up with the CIA to try and overthrow him as a leader. They called it Operation PB Fortune, but eventually this plan was entirely dismissed. But when Eisenhower became president in 1953, they designed a new plan to overthrow him called PB Success. The US invested millions into psychological warfare and political action, and even considered assassinating Jakobo. The United Fruit Company also lobbied millions of dollars into this operation, and started an entire smear campaign to get Jakobo overthrown.

@ajplus_video_7275343042154892586.txt," Are these people right to call the UN a failure? Well, obviously except that time that BTS turned it into a dance floor, right? But seriously, what is the purpose of the UN anyway? The UN was founded to end where? This is Vijay Parshad, a renowned historian and author, and he knows a lot about the UN. After World War II, the major powers wanted to stop violent conflicts from happening again. They wanted to improve dialogue and cooperation between countries. Well, looks like that hasn't gone too well. That has a lot to do with how the UN is structured. Every one of the 193 countries has a seat at the General Assembly. But this is the Security Council. And these five permanent members have complete control. The US, Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom. What is the distribution of power like at the UN? 188 countries in the United Nations don't really have power in the system. It's the countries with a veto in the Security Council. Five countries, the so-called P5, that dominate everything. It was a distribution of power. Five has 100% of the power. 188, almost 0% of the power. So how does the makeup of the UN today, in terms of its member states, differ from its founding? At 1945, most of the world was not yet free from colonialism. And even though, for instance, India was a member. It was a member of British India. In the 1960s, a swath of African countries attained the independence. This is the world in 1945. And these are the original member states at the UN's founding. Fast forward to today, its members now look like this. But guess what didn't change? Who gets to be the permanent five? And the US especially plays a heavy hand in world conflicts. The US is a fire starter. It starts a lot of conflicts. When the US started this campaign against Iran, so-called nuclear program, it was the UN that broke it that agreement between the European United States and Iran. And then the US just walked away from it. It was also thanks to this colonial run power dynamic that the UN planned a partition Palestine passed back in 1947. Since then, the US has vetoed more than 50 different security council resolutions critical of Israel. And this gridlock occurs almost every time there's a resolution that threatens the agendas of any of the permanent five members. That's why it's so hard for the UN to actually accomplish much. Yes, to be fair, UN agencies like UNICEF and UNHCR do important work. But the imbalance of power means the general assembly itself has become a little symbolic. And often has a hard time making real change. More and more officials have been pushing the case for democratizing the UN. Some have called for African and Asian states to be given permanent seats on the security council. But DJ says that's only the beginning to real change. Democraticization of the UN has become about increasing the P5 into maybe P8 or P10 rather than democratizing the whole system, including bringing a great of voice to the general assembly. Look, reforming the UN is a big task, but it may very well be worth it because the UN has a potential to be a lot more effective than it is. The 193 countries on behalf of almost 8 billion people have a treaty obligation to the UN charter. There is no other text that all the countries in the world have signed on to.

@skynews_video_7203611995239730437.txt, Over the past year the West has unleashed a far-reaching package of sanctions that it hopes will cripple Russia's war machine. This includes freezing the Russian central banks access to hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign currency reserves. Russian banks and wealthy individuals have had their assets frozen and trade with the country has been dramatically cut. The G7 and the EU also recently introduced a price cap on Russian crude oil which it hopes will drive down market prices squeezing the country's revenues. Russia's economy has coped fairly well. The EU delayed its ban on Russian oil exports and in the meantime the country benefited from soaring wholesale energy prices since then it has successfully diverted much of its trade to China and India. The people living in Russia unemployment is at a record low and wage growth at record high. That being said hundreds of thousands of people have left the country and this loss of human capital could soon start weighing on economic growth. Sanctions on Russia have not yet had the effect that many Western leaders hoped but things could soon start to change. Now that the EU and the G7 have introduced their price cap on Russian energy exports the country's revenues are falling just as military expenditure is increasing. It means the country is having to sell Chinese currency reserves in order to stabilize its finances. 2023 will be more challenging for Russia. The country's energy revenues are starting to fall but the country has built up a significant cushion that economists believe will allow it to weather the strain of sanctions in the coming year.,subjective

Navigating sanctions and export control compliance is a complex and crucial endeavour, especially for businesses engaged in international trade. Sanctions are government-imposed restrictions on certain countries, entities or individuals, while export controls regulate the exports of goods and technologies that can post security risks. Compliance requires a deep understanding of constantly evolving regulations, meticulous due diligence in screening business partners and transactions, and the implementation of robust internal processes.

U.S. Defense Department began gathering data from non-local events. So we're talking about from a perspective of the present path and future events. It's going on non-locally in the quantum hologram on adjacent timelines relative to the observer. That data has been taken and used politically. How has it? Well, even though there was a consensus among the project people that I had contact with as a child on project Pegasus, that we should never play God in trying to influence or, for example, prevent future events or implement future events based on prior knowledge of them. That instead, the intelligence gathered by a quantum axis would be used to engage in such a change in planning for future events. That nonetheless, there was a decision made to approach future American presidents and presumably vice presidents. I don't know if it was just limited to the presidency. But I know to a personal certainty that the president that have held the White House, the presidency, since the early 1970s, have been approached prior to their prison and informed of their destiny. Now that may have been an intelligent decision. Clearly, if your primary goal is survival and peace in a nuclear age, you clearly want individuals who are psychologically prepared for the presidency. In 1971, they were bringing some of my books back from the future and studying them because they were aware of the fact that I was destined to become the principal whistleblower about the activities of project Pegasus. My father and I had the pleasure of meeting George H. W. Bush and his son and his mid-20s George W. Bush in 1971 at one of the lunches that was being held in project Pegasus where they were bringing future political leaders through the project and informing them of their destiny. And at that luncheon, the project people were occupying three or four tables, actually an entire wing of a restaurant. And a young George W. Bush then around 25, I was around nine. And really with the demeanor, I described this on one of my radio in the least, George W. Bush at 25 was the most electrifying, energetic person I've ever stood in front of. He was laughing and joking and said to me, Andy, have you heard? As discombogulating as that news would have been to anybody, but certainly to also find out that your father is also going to be present in a short period of time, must have certainly been a very shocking thing to learn. Particularly when the people who are telling you are people that Dr. Harold Agnew and with the director of all of the most national labs, literally the leading laboratory in the world for advanced applications in quantum physics. So certainly when George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush were approached by Project Pegasus and invited to that lunch, they got to knew that this was the real deal because they were dealing with some of the leading defense scientists in the country and the leading defense lab in the country. So they knew that it was the real deal and what they were being told was true.",subjective

Well, after the USSR collapsed in 1991, the US had unprecedented financial and military power everywhere in the globe. So they moved to create the world trade organization that would force every country in the world to work within a trade framework that's beneficial to Western multinationals and banks. For example, Western intellectual property law or patents are now enforced globally by the WTO. This allows Western corporations to buy patents on new technology and prevent other countries around the world from using that technology. This also prevents them from then becoming competitors with these Western corporations. It's worth mentioning that China is doing the exact opposite with the Belt and Road Initiative actually exporting new technology to a lot of their trade partners, which of course is infuriating for the US and Western multinationals, who for years have been holding back technological progress for the sake of market competition.

I mean, on a political level, the International Criminal Court has always sort of been viewed as a US-dominated tool. So you had the war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s. So the United States advocated for setting up an ad hoc tribunal rather than implementing a permanent international criminal court. But the United States does not recognize the International Criminal Court as having jurisdiction over all countries. It prefers for nations in Africa, primarily, to be subjected to the jurisdiction of something that nonetheless is called an International Criminal Court. So the ICC is overwhelmingly a court that is used by powerful nations to prosecute the Yugoslavia's and the Rwanda's of the world. And the vast majority of the cases that have been prosecuted there have been against involving African nations. When we talk about the International Court of Justice, this is the official world court that was set up by the United Nations in the aftermath of World War II. And the United States actually has been convicted at that court of terrorism. It was convicted in the early 1980s for the mining of the waters around Nicaragua.

Am I right? If you knew that there was a slave colony off the coast of the United States, how many of you would support the slave masters? Nobody would support the slaves. They did exactly what the founding fathers in the United States did. The problem was when they threw out the French, it was a big risk to the United States and to all the other slave-owning countries. Because if you have the Haitian slaves who successfully lead a revolution against their slave masters for whom they are working and making enormous profits, what's going to happen in the United States?

You know you're not going to hold on but you can't let it go. And so the Americans in the British and the French and the Spanish, they all came together and they said, look, okay, you hate slaves now.

They didn't have the resources, they didn't have the things they needed and most importantly, they didn't have trading partners because all of the slave-owning countries, including the United States, decided, listen, we're just going to emissorate them.

And so even now they're producing that on their own, nobody will trade with them. So you got all this coffee, you got all this sugar, but nothing can happen. And so Haiti becomes emissorated, just immensely emissorated and poor. So instead of growing the first black republic in the history of the world, instead of growing and expanding, Haiti just gets poorer and poorer. This is the story.

And then come on, man, the French, look five to six years, the brutal French. And then, man, but you slaves, I'm sorry, you're going to have to pay them back. Of course, they didn't have money. And so the Haiti just became more emissorated. And this is how the world is, my friends, not everywhere. If you don't study this stuff and you don't see it, you somehow can never understand.

@vicenews_video_7234560693561773339.txt," Turns out global warming is happening quicker than scientists expected. Here's why that's a huge deal. Remember the Paris Agreement? The international treaty adopted by world leaders to limit global warming? In the 2015 agreement, countries agreed to take action to pursue a 1.5-degree Celsius rise in temperature above pre-industrial levels as the limit. This figure compares our current average global temperatures to average global temperatures in the pre-industrial era from 1850 to 1900. The 1.5-degree Celsius increase is a key number in global policy-around climate change. Scientists predict that passing this figure would trigger dangerous consequences, including worsening heat waves, droughts, and flooding. But new data predicts that it is more likely than not that the world will pass this key threshold within the next five years. In 2020, the World Meteorological Association estimated that there was a 20% chance of breaking this limit in the next five years. In 2022, the estimate jumped to 50%. Now, just one year later in 2023, the chance of breaking the limit is 66%. Scientists say the acceleration of global warming is due to an expected Elino weather pattern, as well as carpet emissions.",subjective
@praxben_video_7214607133487287594.txt," So let me play the old advocate. If the embargo is the reason why Cuba's economy is the way that it is, or aren't there any examples of any other socialist governments running successful, you're actually stumbling into the interesting history of US intervention. I've said it before and I've said it a thousand times. Blaming US intervention on every failure of your system is such a cope and makes you guys look so weak. Not only that, but it shows you guys don't even bother to read about these countries that you support so much. That's why you guys can never give proof that Cuba's failures are caused by US sanctions. You guys never reference books about these subjects. Instead, you just reference memes and act like they prove your point. Cuba's problems are not caused by the embargo and there's overwhelming evidence for this. For example, I could reference the largest study done on this embargo, which found that US economic sanctions with respect to Cuba generally had a minimal overall historical impact on the Cuban economy. Let's take a look at some economic data. You can see in the decade after the revolution, they had negative economic growth. It improved a little bit later on, but did not keep up with the Latin American average. Then it got really bad and after 94, they recovered quite a bit and had some of the fastest growth they had had in decades. So why did they have negative growth after socialism, but have really good growth in the 90s? Well, as economists, Carmelo Missilago points out, one of the revolution's major targets was to reduce economic dependency on the United States. And the way they did this was by trading with countries like the Soviet Union and China instead. The Soviet Union bought millions of tons of different materials and opened up a credit line for $100 million for Cuba. Soviet imports of Cuban sugar were actually higher than the island's loss of US imports. And all social imports combined significantly surpassed US imports in the early part of that year. So even though the US employed sanctions, it didn't matter because Cuba just traded with these other countries instead. So conditions becoming worse after the revolution or some conditions just not improving as much after the revolution is not due to a lack of trade. It's entirely due to these socialist policies. And how can we know this for sure? Well, remember that positive economic growth I'd pointed out before? How did this happen? Well, after the Soviet Union fell and Cuba was in a major pickle, they decided to engage in some market liberalization to get further away from socialism. It didn't exactly turn them into a free market economy, but again, it was way less socialist than it was before. They even brought in very free market economists to assess their reforms. Mesa Lago definitively proves that it was the socialist policies that hurt Cuba. And this is from a guy who's even for removing the embargo on Cuba, just like I am. US intervention did not cause the failures in Cuba. It did not cause the failures in China, nor the failures in the Soviet Union. It didn't cause these famines or these mass murders. There is a common thread in all these failures and it is not US intervention. Read a book. Praxven, love me.",subjective

@pennylane.1234_video_7336021467240582446.txt," It is a particularly interesting location for me to be sitting today, given that over a decade ago I sat in this very chair right here in the European Union Parliament. And at that time I warned the world of what was coming. During that conversation, it was hosted at the time by the green and EFA and a number of the other parties of the European Union's various representations. We were having a conversation on whether Europe should adopt the United States policy of allowing for the patents on biologically derived materials. And at the time I urged this body and I urged people around the world that the weaponization of nature against humanity had dire consequences. Tragically I sit here today with that unfortunate line that I don't like to say, which I told you so. But the fact of the matter is we're here not for a reprisal on past decisions. We're here to actually once again come to the face of the human condition and ask the question, who do we want to be? What do we want humanity to look like? And rather than seeing this as an exercise in futility, which is very easy from time to time when you're in the position I'm in, I actually see this not as an exercise in futility. I see this as one of the greatest opportunities that faces us because we now have a public conversation, which is now front and center in people's minds. When this was an esoteric conversation about biological patents, nobody cared. But when that conversation came home, then it became something people can care about. So I'm actually quite grateful for this opportunity. I thank the members of parliament for hosting this. I thank all of the translators who I apologize in advance. I always use terminology that is probably very difficult to translate. So my apologies. I'd also like to acknowledge the fact that many of you are aware of my involvement with this. In large part due to the amazing work of my wonderful wife, Kim Martin, who encouraged me at the very early days of this pandemic to get on front of the camera and talk about all the information that I had been sharing among very small groups around the world. And it was in fact her encouragement that put me in a place where many of you have heard what I have to say. Ironically, the world that I came from that used to be very popular, my CNBC and Bloomberg presentations which were televised on mainstream media around the world, was an audience that I lost. I can confidently say COVID diminished my fame. But I can also confidently say that I'd rather stand among the people with whom I'm standing today than any of the folks that were part of that previous world. So this is a much better place to be. My role today is to set the stage for this conversation in a historical context. Because this did not come in the last three years. This did not come in the last five or six years. This actually is an ongoing question that probably began here in Europe in the early stages of the mid 1900s, but certainly by 1913, 1914 this conversation started right here in central Europe. The pandemic that we alleged to have happened in the last few years also did not happen overnight. In fact, the very specific pandemic using coronavirus began in a very different time. People try to advance the slides here with one of these things. There we go. Most of you don't know that coronavirus as a model of a pathogen was isolated in 1965. Coronavirus was identified in 1965 as one of the first infectious replicable viral models that could be used to modify a series of other experiences of human condition. It was isolated once upon a time associated with the common cold. But what's particularly interesting about its isolation in 1965 was that it was immediately identified as a pathogen that could be used and modified for a whole host of reasons. And you heard me correctly. That was 1965. And by the way, these slides are public domain. You're welcome to look at every single reference. Every comment that I made is based on published material. So do make sure that you look at those references. But in 1966, the very first COV coronavirus model was used as a transatlantic biological experiment in human manipulation. And you heard the date, 1966. I hope you're getting the point of what I'm saying. This is not an overnight thing. This is actually something that's been long in the making. A year before I was born, we had the first transatlantic coronavirus data sharing experiment between the United States and the United Kingdom. And in 1967, the year I was born, we did the first human trials on inoculating people with modified coronavirus. Is that amazing? 56 years ago, the overnight success of a pathogen that's been 56 years in engineering. And I want that to chill with all of you. Where were we when we actually allowed in violation of biological and chemical weapons treaties? Where were we? As a human civilization, when we thought it was an acceptable thing to do to take a pathogen for the United States and infect the world with it. Where was that conversation? And what should have been that conversation in 1967? That conversation wasn't had. Ironically, the common cold was turned into a chimera in the 1970s. And in 1975, 1976 and 1977, we started figuring out how to modify coronavirus by putting it into different animals, pigs and dogs. And not surprisingly, by the time we got to 1990, we found out that coronavirus as an infectious agent was an industrial problem for two primary industries. The industries of dogs and pigs, dog breeders and pigs, found that coronavirus created gastrointestinal problems. And that became the basis for Pfizer's first spike protein vaccine patent filed. Are you ready for this? In 1990. Did you hear what I just said? 1990, Operation Warp Speed? I'm sorry. Where's the warp and the speed? Pfizer 1990, the very first spike protein vaccine for coronavirus. Isn't that fascinating? Isn't it fascinating that we were told that, well, the spike protein is a new thing. We just found out that that's the problem. No. As a matter of fact, we didn't just find out it was not just now the problem. We found that out in 1990 and filed the first patents on vaccines in 1990 for the spike protein of coronavirus. And who would have thought Pfizer? Clearly, the innocent organization that does nothing but promote human health clearly Pfizer. The organization that has not bought the votes in this chamber in every chamber of every government around the world, not that Pfizer. Certainly they wouldn't have had anything to do with this. But oh, yes, they did. And in 1990, they found out that there was a problem with vaccines. They didn't work. You know why they didn't work. It turns out that coronavirus is a very malleable model. It transforms and it changes and it mutates over time. As a matter of fact, every publication on vaccines for coronavirus from 1990 until 2018, every single publication concluded that coronavirus escapes the vaccine impulse. Because it modifies and mutates too quickly for vaccines to be effective. And since 1990 to 2018, that is the published science, ladies and gentlemen. That's following the science. Following the science is their own indictment of their own programs that said it doesn't work. And there are thousands of publications to the effect, not a few hundred. And not paid for by pharmaceutical companies. These are publications that are independent scientific research that shows unequivocally, including efforts of the Camero modifications made by Ralph Berk and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. All of them show vaccines do not work on coronavirus.",subjective

Arrested 10 for pandering with this operation, we arrested four for pimping.

Twenty-six people were arrested in the two-day sting for crimes that included pandering, prostitution, and pimping according to deputies.

Maybe the next love comes in. Maybe I don't know. You're caught in the five, ten years. You think the Nazis will come to power and put you on trial here? Ah, that's a slur. That's what you're saying. No. That's what you're selling me. This goes round and round in Turkey, doesn't it? Yeah, it may go around in other places too. OK. In torture, cited credible reports of Turkish law enforcement officials engaging in torture and ill treatment of detainees. The committee said it was concerned at the reported impunity enjoyed by those who committed such acts. Impunity doesn't suggest you were doing much investigation into those things, doesn't. We have a zero tolerance policy towards torture. We have, in fact, clear our prisons, our judicial system from torture. We've had this in the past. But what you're referring to is what happened right after the bloody coup attempt on July 15, 2016, when the fetter terrorists carried out a coup attempt in Turkey killing 251 people. It doesn't license you to torture people. I didn't say there is torture. I'm not saying this to justify it. I'm referring to those who made those claims who were actually behind this coup attempt killing 251 people, injuring around 1,200 people. They had the intent to kill the elected president of Turkey. The reports, Mr. Kalin, go on and on. Two years ago, the NGO Freedom from Torture said that from 2011 to 2016, all the years when Mr. Erdogan and the AKP have been in power, Turkey was one of the top 10 countries for referrals after torture. And in 2016, you moved into the top five. No known investigations were ever carried out. And the number of investigations have been carried out. How many? They have. How many and by whom? You want me to say 20, 30, 40? Well, I can give you a few more details. I'd like the truth. I will be happy to give you the exact numbers. I don't have the reports with me. I'll be happy to send them to you. In 2017, the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights said, the problem of effective investigations and impunity of security forces is a very long standing and entrenched problem in Turkey. So you're not fooling anyone. I know. No. We are not in the business fooling anyone. We are taking care of our own national security. When you face this kind of credible national security threats against the PKK or from the PKK, from ISIS terrorists, from Feta terrorists, those terrorists organizations, the West only recognizes one of them. That is ISIS, because it's attacks Western interests. But the others, since they are only in Turkey and attacking Turkey, the elected government, security forces, or the civilians, nobody wants to talk about it. Mr. Kallin, you sent in last month, you sent in your Syrian proxy forces into the northeast corridor of the country, knowing that in all likelihood, they would torture abuse and possibly murder people. Because that's exactly what they had done in the northern city of Afran, which you seized in 2018. Isn't it? Not at all. In August that year, I'm the International Report. You gave free reign to Syrian groups armed by you to commit serious human rights abuses in Afran. That didn't happen in Afran. There was looting in Afran, and they were penalized. The UN Human Rights Office reported the situation in Afran country to your nice assurances. Remained dire. Armed factions had carved up the province into zones of influence. There was repeated kidnappings, torture, extortion, and assassination. That's some legacy. William Robuck, who's the top state department official in northern Syria, your forces have committed abuses on the ground, war crimes, and ethnic cleansing. He said on November the 7th, Turkey's military operations, spearheaded by armed Islamist groups on its payroll, represents an intention-laced effort at ethnic cleansing. It was he added an unprovoked military operation that at the time he spoke November the 7th had killed some 200 civilians and left over 100,000 people newly displaced and homeless. We've heard this many times from the Sen Com people within the Trump administration, which actually never got them. And you just dismiss his reconciled with the fact that we are taking this action against their so-called allies. You want them to recognize the PKK in the Sniper cleansing? You want them to recognize the allies. They are reconciling themselves with the PKK terrorist network in Syria, giving them peace of land. And then while at the same time talking about Syria's territorial integrity or ethnic balance in Syria, how can you explain the fact that you favor one ethnic group, which is linked to a PKK terrorist network, the so-called Kurds, against all the Arab non-Kurdish, non-PKK Syrians, the Arabs, the Christians, the Turkaman, all the other Syrians. They are coming to us, telling us the oppression that they are living under, under the YPG. Mr. Kallen, we've talked about some of the criticism of your actions, especially from allies. But what you really want to stand about is criticism at home, isn't it? On October the 10th, your broadcast regulator, RTUK, warned the Turkish media not to say anything critical about your action in Turkey, that there would be, as they put it, zero tolerance of any broadcasting that might negatively impact the morale and motivation of soldiers or may mislead citizens through incomplete, falsified, or partial information that serves the aims of terror. In other words, you put in anything that the government doesn't like and you're in deep trouble, so much for press freedom. I think our president presented this report to him as well. He said, look, this is your own report. OK, this doesn't take us any further. This is not. What it says is that you are giving a free right to PKK in Germany. Why do you do that? And as far as... We are not doing that in Turkey. As far as the West is concerned, this was a report for a British Parliamentary Committee. Back in 2017, there is a fundamental intolerance of alternative narratives in Turkey with the government broadly suppressing, discrediting, or punishing those who contradict its accounts of sensitive event. You like to play the victim? The victim of what? Buies against Turkey. I don't see myself as a victim. I'm just staking the facts. Look, there is an enlargement process or fatigue in Europe. And there are conditions to be met. They don't want to... And you don't need to pass the calendar. And there is a negotiation fatigue in Turkey also. How long will it take it? In another century? For Turkey to be a full member? That's up to you, isn't it? One thing to provide by the conditions. We have left at the purges, the people who were after the coup attempt in 2016. I think I will answer that. The people who were fired from their jobs. Many thousands of them had to be cleared later on because the charges against them were nonsense, weren't they? Thousands of people who were falsely implicated in the coup attempt had to be re-installed because the allegations against them were false, not that they had the chance to defend themselves before they were fired. This is life under your AKP, isn't it? All right. You get purged. You have no chance to defend your... Are you on the eastern side or the western side of Berlin right now? Does it matter? What? On the eastern side. You know how many people were fired from their jobs when the unification happened? We're not talking about Germany. I'm not talking about that. You have to see the conference. I know you don't want to talk about this. You have to see the same context. The same context. No. When it comes to... Your own issues, you want to provide the context. When it comes to Turkey, you deny me the right to state the context. I'm asking the audience here. How many people were fired from their jobs when the unification happened in 19... This is... I'll give you the number. 500,000 people. So what? So what? Soldiers, journalists, diplomats. You can play the what about game. And it's very fashionable. No, I'm providing the context. I'm providing the context. What about Mars? What about Venus? I'm providing the context. What about China? No. You're trying to do the purge. The question is... The fact is that tens of thousands of people were fired and humiliated and their reputations were drawn through the mud. Okay. Before finally, they were able to clear their names. Because there is a judicial path for this. Yeah, but what happened in the meantime? They have applied. Those who were cleared, in fact, are free either to go or to apply for their jobs. And that's still a process underway, of course. I'm not saying that everything is perfect there. There is still room for improvement. There are still things that we need to do to make sure that these people have their full rights. But you have to see this in context. Your party has sat back and watched countless people's lives ruined while you threw allegations at them that turned out to be false. There is a judicial process for them to apply. Eventually. Yeah, eventually made. There was a... There was a... For this 500 thousand. Who cares about the collateral damage? There were...

And so I think that dialogue has happened within inside the government in certain areas inside the government that we need to prepare and that's why in 2017 that's set at the clock of ten years and why Louis Luzando earlier in this year said you know just find a hobby for five years and you know it'll go all the way out in five years and he said that this year so that was 2027 and I would say I've heard 2027 in a kind of an official capacity that I can't reveal.

@emma_pike__video_7291652291847916843.txt," If anybody has some additional information then what I've provided in this video. Hi, my own work takes me to the UN a lot and many of my colleagues are full-time UN employees, so let me add what I can. This creator correctly outlined how yesterday, the 18th of October, the UN Security Council voted on a draft resolution that was put forth by Brazil that would have called for a humanitarian pause to allow life-saving aid to be delivered to millions of civilians in Gaza. This is how the results of the vote looked. So of the 15 members of the Security Council, 12 voted in favor, to abstain, which means they chose not to vote at all, and one, the United States voted against. And here's why that's so crucial. What you need to know about the Security Council is that although there are 15 members, there are five permanent members and those five members have veto power. They are China, France, the Russian Federation, the UK, and US. In practice, that means that if any one of these five members votes no on a resolution, it blocks that resolution. Here's what you need to know about this resolution though, so it was put forth by Brazil, and it condemned, or it would have condemned if it had passed, all attacks against all civilians, including, quote, the heinous attacks by Hamas, end quote, against Israel. This resolution didn't pass, as I'm sure you gathered, with China, Gabon, Mozambique, and the UAE voting in favor, the US, France, UK, and Japan voting against, and then the six remaining members abstaining. You can see right above my head here this resolution, if adopted, it would have strongly condemned all violence and hostilities directed against civilians and all acts of terrorism by its further terms. It would have also called for the secure release of all hostages and unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance, including a food, fuel, and medical treatment. The reason this is so important is the reason that the US ambassador, the US representative, gave for voting no on this resolution, which remember they are also the only one who voted no on the amended basically resolution that was put forth on Wednesday. And here it is, the reason was that the proposed resolution, so this is the one from Monday, the first one, put forth by the Russian Federation, the proposed resolution falls short by failing to mention Hamas. And because you are very clever, I'm sure you can put two and two together and realize that Brazil then decided to put forth another resolution because the first one by the Russian Federation failed, and they said, okay, that's the problem. Then we will explicitly condemn all attacks on civilians, including quote the heinous terrorist attacks by Hamas end quote. And when that resolution had overwhelming support with 12 states voting yes and two abstaining and only being obstructed by the US's veto vote, the US representative said that the security council must speak out yes, but should quote support direct diplomacy efforts that can save lives. The council needs to get this right end quote. It is exceedingly difficult impossible really for me to see how a resolution calling for a humanitarian pause so that life saving humanitarian aid can be delivered two thousands of civilians who are being bombed and forcibly displaced and losing their lives every single day. So I know that could possibly not be what they call quote direct diplomacy efforts that can save lives. Yeah, I feel to see how that could save lives, but maybe that is just me. So what happens now? Well, supporters of this Brazilian draft resolution could instead take it to the General Assembly where there are no vetoes. So we'll see what happens, but in the meantime, I'm reminded by these remarks by Mexico when the General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution last year that aimed to hold the five security council members. The five permanent security council members accountable for the use of veto. And they said veto use reveals the weak position of those who fail to persuade others through reason those wielding such power do not offer solutions but simply obstruct action.",subjective

@thatonedamnginger_video_7296942027479092526.txt," So the VA called me today. We saw my tick talk about the NAR lawsuit. Here's the VA's interpretation of the several lawsuits that are currently going on for consumers versus real estate agents. And I haven't done all the research. They've got a whole team working on this and I'm just me. So I'm going to do the research and I'll follow up on that. The interpretation of the lawsuits that have already gone through are this. Is that certain real estate firms, which I will not name, were forcing sellers to list for a certain percentage or else they were telling those sellers that they were not going to put their home onto the multiple listing service. Now let me explain a little bit of that. If a real estate agent who works for a brokerage and they all put homes onto the MLS, the multiple listing service, and that is where appraisers that appraise homes gather their data. So if you're saying that I won't even list your home unless you paid this much, that is illegal and that is steering. And apparently firms have been coaching their agents to conduct businesses way and that's shitty. I would also side with the plaintiffs that that's the case and I will find out. Next. It's already ahead of it. They have a whole team and I am just one person. So they have already set forth a team and we already have to upload every single solitary VA loan in the industry point blank period. Every VA loan that gets done, the whole loan gets uploaded to the VA for a full file review. And during that full file review, they checked a closing disclosure to see was the veteran overcharge where the fees allotted correctly. 37% of lenders by the way screw up. And they have to fix it post closing. That was announced and talked about at the VA Lenders Conference for deficiencies from lenders. That is one of the most common ones. Anyway, so they're going to be very carefully reviewing closing disclosures even though the lawsuit has not settled yet and the decisions have not been made, they will be checking closing disclosures to see who is getting paid what, whom is paying it. And they're also going to be looking to see if there's just, again, anything being overcharge or not marked the way it should be on a closing disclosure. And then they will be pushing to make updates if necessary at that point. So service members and veterans are not negatively impacted by using their VA loanbed. That's the message from the VA to veterans. And I love that they're watching my TikToks that gives me happy hearts. This is not the VA's message. Now this is my message. This message is to real estate agents because my follow up question to the VA while I was on the phone with them, well, what happens if realtors are having veterans pay things like transaction fees outside of the closing transaction, which is not allowed? Because the VA home loan is literally codified. CFR 38, the 267 federal laws prohibit veterans from paying brokerage commissions or transaction fees of any kind. And that is the handbook and the federal law as of now. Unfortunately, the VA is not a regulatory authority and they don't have any teeth yet. Veterans, this message is for you. If you're a real estate agent, ask you to pay them outside of the closing disclosure, which you would sign in front of an attorney or a title rep, do not pay them. You are not allowed to pay them. That is illegal. The VA cannot have any recourse on this. The message was that you need to get in contact with the Department of Commerce if a real estate agent attempts this from you. And again, they are monitoring to see if these lawsuits pass. From now going forward, whether or not veterans and active duty service members using their VA home loan benefit are going to be negatively impacted should this pass. And they're looking to see the behavior of real estate agents surrounding the VA loan benefit. How are they going to be treating veterans and active duty service members who want to utilize this benefit? Stay tuned for more updates.",subjective

@geo_quest_video_7291281233324117254.txt," There are several reasons behind the deep-seated animosity between Serbia and Kosovo. Delving into history, Kosovo was historically a part of Serbian territory for many centuries. However, in 1839, the Ottoman Empire defeated Serbia in the Battle of Kosovo, leading to Kosovo falling under Ottoman rule. During this Ottoman rule, a significant number of ethnic Albanians migrated to Kosovo, eventually becoming the majority population. This demographic shift heightened tensions between Albanians and Serbian communities. In 1918, Serbia became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. However, following the breakup of the Yugoslavian Kingdom in 1990, chaos ensued between Serbians and Albanians. The predominantly Albanian population in Kosovo sought independence from Serbia. Subsequently, Kosovo, along with Albanians, engaged in conflict against Serbia, resulting in humanitarian crises. NATO intervened by unexpectedly bombing Serbians, compelling them to retreat from Kosovo. In 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia.

And it has lowered the prices of essential goods such as food, including for us here in the UK. Today, over 60% of world trade flows to harifrey. A core component of this open and reliable world trading system is the WTO's ability to solve disputes between states. When two states disagree, they now solve this by using the WTO's dispute settlement system rather than engaging in damaging trade wars. The first step in the system is a consultation. If this fails to solve the dispute, the complaining states can ask an expert panel to effectively sue the other. Once a legal judgment is given, states can appeal the legal judgment in the WTO's highest court. But today, this system is under threat. This court, the Appalach body, has been unable to hear a appeal since 2019. This is because the USA has been vetoing the appointment of any new judges. The availability of the route of appeal is key to the legitimacy of the dispute settlement procedure. Without it, the very existence of the WTO could be threatened. That's why, in our new paper, World Tradeers, we're calling on the UK to join something called the MPIA, or multi-party interim appeal arbitration mechanism.

Maybe they are leaders or bankers or financial systems in some way or the other, all these countries are sanctioned. That's around one third of the world. Imagine that. 33% of the world is living under some sort of sanctions. But here's the irony. Most of it doesn't even work. It's like fighting a bear with a walking stick. Does it count as a defensive tool? On paper I guess it does. But will it really make a difference? That's where the stick fails and so do sanctions. They're just to say for alternative to military intervention. Your soldiers stay in your barracks, your guns in your holster and your conscience intact. But where did this idea come from? And how have sanctions evolved over the last century? Time for a flashback. First things first, what are sanctions? It's the action taken against the economy of another country. The objective is not financial though. It is political. You weaken the economy, you force the leadership to act. At least that's the hope. Parents with teenagers would know. You withhold pocket money when your kids act out. But the idea isn't to make them poor, is it? The idea is to teach them a lesson. Just one problem though. Like teenagers, nations are unpredictable. So sanctions can be counterproductive. The policies as old as politics itself, ancient Greece is set to have pioneered sanctions. The city of Athens banned traders from another city. Megara. And did it work? Well, Megara turned to Sparta for help. They ended up fighting for 30 years with Athens and eventually the war ended Greece's golden age. So I guess that's a hard no. But these are rudimentary sanctions. Nothing targeted or complicated about them. A more sophisticated attempt was made by Napoleon. In 1806 he announced the continental blockade. He tried to cut off Britain from Europe. No trade, no travel, not even mail. And did that work. Well, in period Russia did not support the blockades in Napoleon and waited Russia to force them. He lost 300,000 men, his kingdom and his reputation. So again, a hard no. By the 20th century sanctions became more formal. One organization played a key role in that. The League of Nations.

One is all those people are dead and two were not assigned to the ICC because we didn't ratify the Rome statutes and so they couldn't investigate us even if they wanted to. Essentially it was an NGO making a statement so the news isn't going to cover that.",subjective
@ahbeeolah_video_7281053645343329582.txt," Do you know what globalization is? Hi everyone. I'm Abbyola Gouron. This is DSR in a minute or less. And obviously we're somewhere new today because we are trapped over not in the important Austin. So globalization is currently a very large topic of conversation, especially when it comes to international politics and policy. Recently, I think just a couple of days ago, oh my god, but the world trade organization released a report talking about the fears of fragmentation amongst global cultures and the global economy. And what globalization means first before we dive into this little... Okay. I'm making a video, baby. You can do this literally anyway. Okay. Guys, Butterball needs to play a lot. We're doing this. So focus, focus. But also don't focus. So globalization is any type of, basically major... We'll say an expedited process of awareness and interaction and... interaction and involvement when it comes to certain cultures, economic policies, so many other things. So a couple examples that I kind of think will help you get people put this in context. We talk a lot here about slavery and how that is connected to decreasing the capitalism. Slavery is one of the first large examples that we see of globalization because not only did it create capitalism, but it ended up creating the globalization of capitalism which made it more prevalent in countries across the world that would likely have not had it before without this kind of major event happening. A positive example of globalization can include the elevation of certain cultures in a way to help bring them back. So for example, there have been some indigenous groups that have been able to raise money and bring awareness to their existence by the process of globalization. So when something is globalized, we take it from existing or never scale it exists. And even though that thing could possibly become more frequent on its own, what ends up happening in the process of globalization is it makes it explode. And it makes it happen everywhere. So hip hop, for example, faced a large globalization because it was originally listened to and created in New York and some parts of the West Coast, but after it was globalized, everybody across the world knows what hip hop is. They can all probably tell you a few hip hop songs if not many, many more than that. And everybody can tell you if your hip hop artist. And so hip hop is one of those examples of it being globalized. Now, when it comes to discussing whether or not globalization's positive or negative, what often is left out is the dark impacts it can have. The culture can be elevated and that can be great. A culture can be elevated and that can be great. For example, Bali has had a major boost when it comes to their economy for tourism because of many tourists are going there. But now, because, y'all, it's chaos today. But now, because of that same globalization and expansion of their economy, of their environment, of their culture, they have now dealt with cultural erosion. Which comes from it being commodified and created for tourism. Hawaii is something that has dealt with this. Even though Hawaii has never belonged to the United States. There are initially some benefits in interacting with other places before it was then overtaken and still in the United States. Anyways, different conversations, different story. So, while somebody getting exposure can be good, that without protections involving that exposure, it ends up just being harmful. Because what you're doing is you're placing something in the sun, but you're not making sure that it's actually protected from UV rays. So, we'll talk a little bit more about this later because there are a bunch of people coming this way and they all look scared about it all. But we'll talk to you later and hopefully not in the airport. Bye!",subjective

I mean it was just like so relaxed and casual. I mean the woman was clearly a super intelligent, but didn't feel like a lot of pressure, like she was trying to test us or like we were out of our league or anything like that. And so we have to surely get a conversation, like you know, we're trying to impress her, like you do with any company, we give her a resume. And then they have this thing where like they have a banquet later in the day, and they have all these tables for dinner, like one table for each company. And you can only have dinner with that company if they've invited you. So it's almost like getting a second interview or a first interview, you know, I don't know. So like they invite us back, me and my co-worker. And my co-worker is super smart. And like I mean it didn't feel like they were just inviting anybody. Like it really could have been that they genuinely were interested in both of us. I don't know. Maybe they say you have to be invited back to make you feel special, but really there's invited everybody back to, you know, anybody who showed interest, I don't know. But I'd be shocked if other people didn't also show interest in the CIA. So anyway, we're seeing at the table. We're talking to the main recruiter who's like the most chatty one, and there's like one or two other people who were either recruiters or maybe there was another person who was invited from earlier that day.

And I was like, I don't really want to do that because like I really want to learn EBO. Like I'm EBO, you know. And I mean if I know EBO already, like I'll learn how so too, but like priorities. I need to learn like my own identity first, you know. And also like I really want to have a family so I can actually be with them and enjoy them.

@general.discharge_video_7195417807981612334.txt," Specializing in raids, ambushes, sabotage, targeted killings, and unconventional warfare. We're not talking about Delta Force or SEAL Team 6. We're talking about the elite Tier 1 Equipment known as the Special Activity Center. When the United States takes measures towards national security, it has three options, diplomacy, military action, and then covert action. When they need the third option, they call the Special Activity Center, as covert action is their bread and butter. They take this stuff seriously, as their motto is quite literally Latin for third option. Previously referred to as the Special Activity's Division, the CIA Special Activity Center is a division of the Central Intelligence Agency responsible for covert operations and paramilitary operations. While it is not a military unit, the SAC is often considered on par with Tier 1 units in JSOC, meaning they are tasked with performing some of the most secret of Black Ops missions imaginable. There's two main components of the SAC. The Special Operations Group and the Political Action Group. We'll be covering the Political Action Group in more detail in a later section, so for now we'll be focusing on SAC. Operators who are in the Special Operations Group are officially referred to by the CIA as Specialized Skills Officers. The Special Operations Group is often considered the most secretive Special Operations Force the United States has at its disposal, operating with fewer than a hundred operatives who are mostly selected for military Special Operations best of the best, such as Delta Force, DevGrew, Navy Seals, and Greberays. These highly proficient operators participate in missions throughout the world that the US does not want to be officially involved in. That's right, the missions SAC partakes in are so under the radar that in the event anyone or anything is compromised during a mission. The US government can deny all knowledge and disavow the operators. Similar to how a Special Operations Force operates, there are different components to the Special Activity Center that each Specialized in an area of warfare or environment to provide them with abilities in the full-special or conflict. From what is known, there are four different branches of the Special Activity Center. The Ground Branch, Maritime Branch, Air Branch, and the Armor and Special Programs Branch. The Ground Branch oversees all covert operations handle bond. You guessed it, the Ground. Operators in this branch tend to consist of former members of Delta Force who possess the skills necessary to be effective in this environment. Their experts in surveillance, small arms, field and trade craft, CQB, hostage rescue, and advanced driving. As for the Maritime Branch, those who work in this area are responsible for specialized missions that involve the water. Whether it's VPSS, combat and diving, or utilizing specialized water craft. Members are experts in a variety of sophisticated maritime skills. Naturally, Navy SEALs, DevGru operators, and Force Reconnaissance Marines tend to make up a majority of this branch because of the environments they're expected to operate on. The Air Branch is responsible for Special Activity Center's Aviation Activities. Incredibly skilled pilots and aviation experts work in this branch and provide top-tier transport and exfiltration measures for the operators. Think of it this way. Just like JSOG has the Nightstalkers, the Special Activity Center has its Air Branch. And last but not least, the Armor and Special Programs Branch is unlike the other three branches. It's more supportive than it is operational. Part of the SAC develops, tests, and acquires new personnel, armory, equipment, and transport. Because of the clandestine nature of the mission's SAC partakes in, gathering weapons and equipment covertly is of the utmost importance. The Armor and Special Programs Branch precures equipment abroad in order to have no connections to the U.S. government in the unfortunate event an SAC operator is compromised or captured. Operators in the Special Activity Center have helped achieve U.S. Armed Policy objectives across the globe. It's one of the most versatile tools in the president's toolbox. The Special Activity Center is often considered the very tip of the spear.",subjective

The base also had a sophisticated radar system that could detect incoming aircraft from hundreds of kilometers away. The airbase was used during the Yugoslav Wars in the early 1990s.

We believed that we were employing the most fearsome economic sanctions in the history of the world. The Russians would not be able to handle those sanctions. Their economy would be greatly weakened. They would be having trouble with the Ukrainians on the battlefield. They would go to the negotiating table and we would end up with a settlement that humiliated them and in effect knocked them out of the ranks of the Great Powers. If we hadn't thought we could beat the Russians in this war, we would not have allowed it to happen, or we at least would have gone to greater lengths to prevent it.

In fact, once it started and it looked like it might be shut down, we pushed the Ukrainians to end the negotiations because we wanted to continue the fight. We thought we could defeat the Russians.

@thebranchmedia_video_7290669531427573034.txt," Would you believe me if I told you that some of the top performing schools in the country are run by the Defense Department? No, seriously. Last year, the network of Defense Department schools up-affirmed all 50 states for both reading and math scores for fourth and eighth graders. Their schools had the highest outcomes in the country for black and Hispanic students. The schools rubbed quickly during the pandemic, which resulted in essentially no pandemic learning losses. Among national test scores for U.S. students overall have stagnated over the last decade. The military schools have made major gains since 2013. So how did they do it? First off, they have some inherent advantages that other schools don't. Families have access to housing and healthcare through the military, and at least one parent has a job. When it comes to the schools themselves, Defense Department schools are well-funded. They often receive more funding than public schools in many states do. Some teachers have reported doubling their salaries by working at military schools. And the classrooms are fully stocked with supplies. Both of which help retain teachers at a time when many are leaving the profession. These schools are also socioeconomically and racially integrated. Children of entry-level privates and experienced officers attend the same classes. An essential structure of the schools mean the curriculum is less affected by school board politics and, well, politics in general. Big decisions have to come from headquarters. An implementation of policies is done very methodically. Now these schools are not perfect. Black and Hispanic students, on average, are still performing behind their white peers at Defense Department schools. And the Pentagon has faced scrutiny for its handling of student misconduct.

@bx_prol_video_7271734982748409130.txt," Hi, you are correct that the United States or its companies do not directly profit off of sanctions. Think of it more as an investment. See, when the U.S. sanctions a country, chances are that country was a colony or a neo-colony of the United States that had a revolution and now won independence. I'll give you a couple examples. Iran was a neo-colony that the U.S. and Britain shared. They had a dictator that directly answered to the United States. U.S. and British petroleum companies were in that country extracting all their oil and giving nothing to the people. Cuba was a neo-colony that lived under a dictator that answered to the United States and lived under a law called the Plat Amendment, which prohibited Cuba from trading with any companies other than U.S. companies and any laws that they wanted to pass in Cuba had to be agreed upon or approved by the United States government. See, one thing I say a lot is if you live in the United States, Canada or Europe, you've experienced a kinder gentler capitalism. It's not kind or gentle at all, but it's nothing like the brutality of capitalism in the global south. And when you reject the dictator, the U.S. installed in your country, you're going to pay. Iran didn't even become socialist. It's a brutal authoritarian theocracy, arguably less brutal than Saudi Arabia, but look how the U.S. is friends with Saudi Arabia. It's just that Saudi Arabia wasn't a neo-colony of the United States and Iran was, so they have to pay. I'll give you one more example. In the early 70s, the U.S. was sanctioning Chile because they had nationalized their copper mines. President Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger were recorded as saying we're going to make their economy scream. Shortly after this, the U.S. did a coup in Chile and installed a right-wing dictatorship. So sanctions are really to destroy a country's economy. Turn their people against them so they can come under the fold of U.S. imperialism. So U.S. companies can go back in there, extract their resources and use their people for cheap or even slave labor.",subjective
@devotedly.yours_video_7330680666926910763.txt," When I watch a narcissist being interviewed, there is nothing I love more than seeing a journalist put him in their place the way Tim Sebastian did with Israeli ambassador, Mark Regev. Decades have gone by when you could have done so much more and anti-Arab discrimination has continued in the same way in Israel. To the point where in 2014 your president, Riven Rivlin, labelled Israel sick with racism and condemned those including politicians who stoke anti-Arab rhetoric and violence. He said, I'm not asking if we've forgotten to be Jewish. I'm asking if we've forgotten how to be human. What are the indictments? When? When? First of all, my person is expressing the moral authority of my country and whenever racism raises its ugly head we will condemn it, we will fight it, we will eliminate it. He was questioning whether you're behaving like human beings. Why do you think what do you think tempted him to even mention that? You don't hear many presidents asking whether there are people behaving like human beings. Isn't this the assigned to him that Israel is a self-critical, introspective country where we debate the issues we don't run away from uncomfortable news, we want to engage, we want to discuss, we want to live up this, we want to live up this. I'm happy to address it. I'm happy to address it. I don't believe it. Let's look at the city of Jerusalem. Under Israeli rule it's become a place of division and poverty predominantly for the Arab sector in East Jerusalem, the part you occupy in 67 and then annex. According to last year's Poverty Report of the National Insurance Institute, three quarters of the residents of East Jerusalem and 83.4% of the children live below the poverty line. That's more than 50% higher than the equivalent poverty rates in the rest of Israel. Why did you let it get so bad? All communities have religious freedom. All the religious sites of all the faiths are protected and that each religious community autonomously administers its own religious sites. So the Christian communities... Well, I'm talking about the religious sites. I'm talking about why the Palestinians... In this whole poor era, we'll get to that in a second. We'll get to that in a second. But one has to look at the facts. This is a city that's important to millions of people around the planet. Yes, so why did you let it sink into poverty? That the religious sites of all faiths are for the first time autonomously administered by their own respective religious communities. The freedom of worship is enshrined in Israeli law. That is something that I believe is well deserved credit for. Why did you let it get so bad? I come back to this question which you don't want to answer. Why did you let it get so bad? I'm not actually... If you look at the situation in the Arab neighborhoods of the city, you'll see that there are gaps that need to be narrowed. But compare them to Arabs in other parts of the Middle East or even in the Palestinian territories, you'll see that they are considerably better. Well, let's look at some of those gaps because as your own human rights organisation, Betsellem points out, while Palestinians make up almost 40% of the city's population, the municipality runs only six family health centers in their neighborhoods. Six. Do you know how many they run in the Jewish neighborhoods? Tell me so. Twenty-seven. Same story with social services. I'm not in the four in the Palestinian neighborhoods. Nineteen in the Jewish neighborhood. Do you think that's fair? First of all, the Arab population of Jerusalem makes up about a third of the city and it's important, I think, that Arab Jerusalem might receive the same services as do as everyone else in the city. I'm a big pay taxes, but you can't help them. I've heard directly from the mayor of Jerusalem, Nehobar Kati said he's committed to narrowing those gaps. Some of Jerusalem have full rights to vote in municipal elections. Not in national elections. Yes. But you were talking to me specifically. Your question was about the municipal government of Jerusalem hands out its resources. That was what your question was about. Surely the Palestinians, the Arab population of Jerusalem would be doing itself a failure. A favor? If it fully participated in the democratic process. They can't fully participate. Because they're intimidated too. In the terrorist groups who intimidate people. You have not one shred of evidence to back that up. I beg to disagree, sir. Where's your evidence? Groups like Hamas, Islamic, Jihad and the other extremist groups are not known for being particularly tolerant about people who have said that. That's not evidence.",subjective

And today I'm going to teach you all about the lies and where they ripped off the 2D fruity pseudocytes in the Gateway Experience document. It doesn't come from where you think. So many content creators are like a human centipede of bullshit. They just crap nonsense into one another's mouths and pass it on down the line without ever doing any primary research or fact checking any of the shit that they proclaim to be true. The first lie is that the Gateway document is from the CIA. It's not. It was in their archive and their library that is sourced from many different sources. But this document specifically comes from the Army, from Army Inscome, Army Intelligence. The Intelligence and Security command who was doing remote viewing testing. I feel for the poor son of a bitch who is tasked with writing this report. Because he ran into something that a lot of us have run into in our professional careers. We're tasked with writing some bullshit report for our boss and in his case a commanding officer to go out and put together information about something that you don't know God damn thing about. So you clutch it together just to get the fucker done. This document is sourced from materials that will become very obvious just how hokey they really are once I show you them. So many people go on and on about the diagrams about how this is the hologram of the mind, the universe's mind and the shape like a tourist. It's got a white hole in a black hole. We'll take a very good look at that little illustration at the bottom there of the tourist. Now do these diagrams look familiar to you? They should because this is the origin of what they put in the gateway document. They come from a 1908 book called a Colt Chemistry by the Theosophists, Annie Besant and CW Leadbeater. The whole premise of this book is how they are using spiritualist techniques and clairvoyance to try to view the atomic structure on the atom. The problem is this book was right widely proven to be a hoax. As Annie Besant was a student years before they wrote this book and she repeatedly failed her chemistry examination to get her bachelor's degree as I understand it she never did. What she did do is memorize old outmoded models of what molecules and atoms were supposed to look like and then regurgitated them in this book and then later on it was proven that they used these old models in this book and claimed that they were accurate and factual when in reality all they were was made up. So secretly taking this Theosophie book and moving it forward and claiming it's something else in the gateway experience document doesn't exactly look good for the accuracy and the reliability of... Now if you'd like some actual science about the gateway experience, let me point you to the book with the eyes of the mind. An empirical analysis about a body states by Glenn Gabbard and Dr. Stewart Twemlow. Dr. Twemlow worked intimately with Bob Monroe to create the gateway experience side up or I mean project or I mean totally legitimate meditation program. This book is very interesting because it touches on the clinical aspects of out-of-body experiences, namely that when people have dissociative states it feels like an out-of-body experience and if you impact them and influence them drive them to believe they're having an out-of-body state or talking to an alien or talking to an ascended master or having a past life regression, they'll believe it. To anybody who's done one of these programs and you feel disattached into associated afterwards and all the while the people that are around you are trying to talk to you about aliens, new opos and what spirit guides they experienced. All that's doing is getting into your mind and pre-programming you to have those experiences in the future and that's a level of fuckery of Dolores Cannon proportions. Oh no!",subjective

Let's talk about the function of the CIA. I think a lot of us have an impression that all the CIA does is gather intelligence. Is information, of course. Now, one would think that if you obtained information, that was based upon fact. And if that is so, what did you do with it? Well, one of the four principal functions of the CIA is together intelligence and ideally forward it to the president, the users of information, policy makers, as I said. Other functions, however, some of them more legitimate than others. One is to run secret wars. The covert action that's written and talked about so much, like what's happening in Nicaragua today from Honduras. Another thing is to disseminate propaganda to influence people's minds. And this is a major function of the CIA. And unfortunately, of course, it overlaps into the gathering of information. You have contact with a journalist. You will give him true stories. You'll get information from him. You'll also give him false stories. Well, give me a concrete example of how you use the pest this way. How false story is planted and how you've got it published. Well, for example, in my war, the Angola War that I helped to manage, one third of my staff was propaganda. Ironically, it's called covert action inside the CIA. Outside, that means the violent part. I had propaganda all over the world, principally in London, in Chasa and Zambia. We would take stories which we would write and put them in the Zambia times and then pull them out and send them to a journalist on our payroll in Europe. But his cover story, you see, would be that he'd gotten them from his stringer in Lusaka who had gotten them from the Zambia times. We've just dozens of stories about Cuban atrocities, Cuban rapists. In one case, we had the Cuban rapists caught and tried by the Oven Bunda maidens who had been their victims. And then we ran photographs that made almost every newspaper in the country of the Cubans being executed by the Oven Bunda women who supposedly had been their victims. These were make photos? Oh, absolutely. We didn't know of one single atrocity committed by the Cubans. It was pure, raw, false propaganda to create an illusion of communists eating babies for breakfast and that's our totally false propaganda.",subjective

@nicgford_video_7244488097319144711.txt," Let's talk about the International Criminal Court and what an object failure it's been. The court came into existence two decades ago, and ostensibly, its main purpose is to prosecute war crimes, particularly in countries that are unwilling or unable to. However, once the court was created, for its first 10 years, it only prosecuted war crimes committed by people in African nations, not exactly why the court had been created. And by 2015, the court was being criticized for being too weak and not being able to go after the power of countries. That all changed with the court's second chief prosecutor, Fatou Benzouda, who announced that she would be investigating war crimes committed in Afghanistan by all warring parties, including the US. But in 2020, when the official investigation had been given the green light, President Trump signed an executive order, placing sanctions and asset phrases on Fatou Benzouda and other ICC staff. First, we're authorizing the imposition of economic sanctions against ICC officials directly engaged in ICC efforts to investigate US personnel or allied personnel. Actions like this are usually reserved for terrorists and leaders of countries that the US doesn't like, but not lawyers. And that's what happened when you step on the toes of the US. Unfortunately, Fatou Benzouda's time at the ICC ended a couple years later, and she was able to wash her hands of the whole thing and pass the torch on to the ICC's next chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, who very quickly announced that he would be dropping the investigation into US crimes in Afghanistan. But not the other parties. At the start of Khan's side at the ICC, the court was becoming irrelevant, and criticized for not being able to hold to account the power for countries in the world. So very quickly, Khan announced that he would be investigating Russian crimes in Ukraine, and in no time at all, the ICC judges announced a rest warrant for Putin. The ICC had done a complete 180, from being hated by the West to being sort of relevant again, but only in the West. The US government mostly still favors the creation of an international criminal tribunal for Ukraine, created through the UN General Assembly to prosecute Putin. Instead of favoring an ICC prosecution of Putin, obviously because they don't want to lend any legitimacy to the court, which is the only place that could potentially prosecute US war crimes. But still, to this day, the court has proved incapable of holding the US to account for its war crimes. And according to the ICC, that's not due to a lack of war crimes.",subjective

For 50 years it was an anti-soviet alliance. So if you not understand it, you don't understand how, or can you not even see how the Russians would perceive it as a threat. And the fact that it keeps getting closer to their border while their troops – I mean, the places where their troops are – you say their troops are and may have been in Ukraine and Georgia are not NATO. I'm not going to pretend to know what goes in President Putin's mind or Russian military commanders. I mean, I barely got a history degree at the University of South Florida. What I can tell you is that NATO is a defensive alliance. It remains a defensive alliance. It is a threat, but it has moved east. Correct? I mean, that's just a fact. It has expanded. Right. Exactly. But there's no reason for anybody to think the expansion is a hostile or threatening move. And we've been saying that throughout the last 15 years, Matt. You're moving closer to Russia. You're blaming the Russians for being close to NATO. No, no, no. That's exactly what he was saying. We're blaming the Russians for violating the territorial integrity of Ukraine and destabilizing the security of the Russian army. Which is not a NATO member. Which is not a NATO member.",subjective
@all_in_tok_video_7260141406390406446.txt," in the United States, among the foreign policy establishment. They tend to think that any country joining NATO is an asset for us. I would argue that it's a liability because it requires the US to defend these countries. If Sweden or Finland gets in a war, we are making a guarantee to send American boys and girls to go defend that country. Now, they also make a guarantee to defend us, but realistically, are we going to benefit? Does our security benefit by having Sweden or Finland? We don't know how life is going to defend us? No. Every time you add a country to NATO, you're making a commitment for Americans to have to go defend that country. I would argue that's a liability, not an asset for America. Now, you know, it's an asset for is a military industrial complex because all these countries when they join NATO can spend 2% of their GDP on defense. And they can only spend that money on defense contractors who are interoperable with the NATO platform, which is basically these approved Western contractors. So the defense industry loves NATO expansion. The military industrial complex. They're locked into vendor lockers? Absolutely. Oh, I didn't know there was vendor lockers.",subjective
@theeconomist_video_7289517562780454176.txt," How did Gaza and the West Bank come under Israeli occupation? In 1948, during the first Arab-Israeli war, an estimated 700,000 Palestinians fled or were pushed out of their homes. They called this the Nakba, the catastrophe. In 1949, a truce agreement carved up territory between Israel and Arab states, thought there was no new state for the Palestinians who had been displaced. Most were left in one of two areas, the West Bank controlled by Jordan or Gaza controlled by Egypt. The conditions in Gaza were dire. Under Egyptian military rule, Palestinians weren't allowed into Egypt, nor could they enter Israel. They were in effect, trapped. Then, in 1967, during the six-day war, the West Bank and Gaza were taken by the Israeli military, marking the start of the Israeli occupation. The 1990s saw the start of a peace process which might have brought that occupation to an end, but it's told. Today, Palestinians living in the West Bank have autonomy in big cities and towns, but are surrounded by Jewish settlements, and are caught off by Israel's security barrier. While the two million Palestinians living in Gaza remain effectively locked away, Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005. Two years later, Hamas and Islamist militant group took full control. And this densely populated strip of land has continued to be the scene of assaults and battles with Israel. In our next video, we'll explain the rise of Hamas, and how powerful the group has become.",subjective

@molesrcool_video_7331424580977921326.txt," Earth is getting a new map update and some of the changes are unexpected. Like new islands. Meanwhile cities all over the east coast are starting to sink, some as much as one centimeter per year. So how could it be possible that some places are rising and some places are sinking? It's actually pretty simple. Greenland is basically one giant ice sheet and ice weighs a lot and that puts a lot of pressure on the sediment which forces it down. And we've put that giant ice cube in a man-made sauna for the past 100 years or so and now it's starting to sweat a lot. So in the past 10 years the bedrock of Greenland has risen 20 centimeters which is way more than it would have just on its own. So all that ice is melting off of Greenland and into the ocean and now the east coast is sinking. Places like New York City, Long Island, Baltimore and Virginia Beach are being particularly affected. All of those cities are seeing areas of rapid subsidence which basically just means sinking land. Well it's very easy to picture sea level rise looking something like this. A lot of places it's going to look something more like this as rising waters permeate the sediment and cause the top layer to collapse in on itself. Subcidence is already happening in a major way in Florida where entire high rise buildings have collapsed due to increasing subsidence. But at least once Florida is underwater there will be some new land up for grabs in Greenland. Shout out to Taylor Swift for sponsoring this new update.

@abnormalbeing0_video_7275586010229116165.txt," The US is making a military alliance to wage war against China, but the nations that are standing with the US are forced to stand with it. So when it comes to war, will they be able to fight? In the recent summit, the leaders from the US, Japan, and South Korea met. The goal was to talk about future cooperation, but as soon as they started discussing China, they forgot everything. They planned about China and their alliance against China. Japan and South Korea are supporting the US. The experts say this alliance can change after the election outcomes. That means the US is involved in their elections, and the collaboration is nothing more than a forced practice. So will they be able to stand against China in actual war? Let's find out. Welcome back to another exciting episode of our channel. Innovation Diary brings you China's innovation stories, projects, and growing influence in different parts of the world. If you are new to the channel and enjoy learning about fast-paced modernity, especially China's development and growing power, you will find our videos intriguing. In this video, we will discuss how the summit plan to talk about collaboration, converted into a military alliance against China. We will also discuss if the US is involved in other nations' elections. Watch the video till the very end to know if the countries stand against China. Let's get started. The United States Leaders from the United States, Japan, and South Korea gathered at Camp David to discuss their future cooperation. This meeting has raised questions about its impact on regional relationships, especially with China. Recently, leaders from the United States, Japan, and South Korea came together at the Camp David summit. They gathered to discuss how they could work together in a new and improved way. But most of their meetings were all about decisions in China. It's important to note that the US said their intention wasn't to upset China. The leaders said all they did was express some concerns about China's actions in the South China sea, and its approach to the Taiwan issue. President Joe Biden played a key role during the summit. He emphasized the need for a fresh start in how these three countries cooperate. However, details about how the new beginning will be put into action were not discussed. For most of the meeting, the leaders talked about China's activities in the South China sea, which have raised concerns among neighboring countries. While they didn't want their discussions to create any problems with China, they believed it was essential to openly express their concerns about these specific issues. So it is a really good strategy to say hateful things about a nation, and then say, we don't mean to upset them. We are just showing our concerns. This summit was planned to mark the beginning of a new phase in how these three nations worked together in the region. But when they started discussing China, they forgot about developing and collaboration, something that always happens with the US. China didn't react positively to this. Of course, who reacts to hateful comments positively? They criticized the summit, saying it damaged their relationships with their neighboring countries. They also compared this partnership to other groups led by the US, such as Aukas and the Quad. An expert, Siong Yon Lee described the Camp David summit as a quiet understanding. Even though they didn't officially call it an alliance. This is significant because it's different from what usually happens in East Asian security. The leaders also promise to meet every year, do military exercises together, share secret information through a special phone line, and reduce their reliance on China for supplies. Shuyen Heng, a professor in Beijing, mentioned that even though they didn't announce a military alliance, it shows that the US and China's neighbors are becoming more organized in their plans. Both the US and Japan have been preparing for a possible conflict with China over Taiwan, which China claims as its own. So there is no doubt if this summit was about China or not. If you have been watching the news recently, then you know that the US is too obsessed with China. All its meetings and its plans are about China. But why is this happening? Before we continue further, tell us, are you enjoying the video? If yes, please like and share the video and subscribe to our channel for more videos about China's development, power, and influence on the world. Let's continue now. China has rapidly grown to become the world's second largest economy. Its economic influence and expansion into global markets have raised concerns in the United States. The US wants to ensure it remains economically competitive and maintains its global economic leadership. This has made the US scared. And when officials are scared, they take silly steps, like talking about China in a meeting that was meant to plan for a better future. China's rise has also extended to geopolitics. It's become a major player in international affairs, challenging US influence in various regions. This competition for global power has led to increased attention on China. There are concerns about China's military expansion, especially in the South China Sea, which has the potential to disrupt regional stability. Using Taiwan as an excuse, the US is trying to limit China. The US has answers for all Chinese actions. In the US story, China is always shown as the villain. Even in technology, the US never gets tired of telling scary stories about China. It says China's advancements in technology have raised cybersecurity concerns. The US wants to protect its technological leadership and safeguard its critical infrastructure from cyber threats. And to do that, the US looks forward to stopping China, instead of making its defense stronger. The US is actively building alliances and partnerships with countries like Japan, South Korea, Australia, and others to collectively address shared concerns related to China that are raised by the US. The US forces them to say that they are concerned about China. And later it says that a lot of nations think China is a threat. It gets exposed when most of its allies like the UK's officials say want to work with China and won't continue sanctions. So all these concerns made the US talk about China once again at the summit. For China, the most important outcome of the summit was that these three countries are working closely together against China's interests. And the experts say it is true. It surprised China that South Korea, which hadn't always agreed with the US in the past, is now leaning towards them. But many believe that it will get back to China. It is probably under pressure. In the past, South Korea had been hesitant to choose sides between the US and China on these issues. But since President Yoon took office, South Korea has gotten closer to the US, improved its relationship with Japan, and aligned itself more with both countries on matters related to China. The reason will also be out soon. An expert from Temple University, Japan, noted that President Yoon's election in South Korea played a pivotal role in bringing these three countries together. However, the durability of this partnership may depend on the outcome of future elections in South Korea and, to some extent, Japan. It looks like the US was involved in their elections in some way. There were other reasons for the summit too, like North Korea's missile tests, Russia's actions in Ukraine, and a growing perception among regional countries of China as a challenge. But China was the highlight. Will this alliance against China bring any results? Things that are based on realities can only stand still. Like China, a nation that was built on hard work. The base of the strategies is the US's pressure, which creates an artificial environment, and it can't stay for too long. No one can stop China from getting what it wants. The outcome of this alliance's efforts will depend on how effectively it can balance these interests, adapt to changing circumstances, and engage with China constructively. It's essential to recognize that diplomacy, cooperation, and dialogue are key tools in shaping the future of international relations. Ultimately, the path forward will be shaped by the interactions and decisions of all parties involved, with the hope of achieving stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. But if the nations are forced to plan what they are planning, then the end of this alliance is very near. The long-term success of any alliance depends on the commitment of its member nations. If member countries feel they are being forced into actions that do not align with their interests or values, it can strain the alliance's unity. Public opinion within member countries can play a significant role. If citizens perceive that their government is acting against their interests or values, it can lead to public backlash and impact the alliance's stability. And now, everyone knows who's alliance is better. China's alliance is far better than the US and public eyes. We would like to take a moment here and appreciate you all for commenting and sharing your opinions. Your insights always impress us. In your opinion, what are the potential outcomes and challenges for alliances that primarily rely on external pressure? Will the three nations be able to stand against China? Why does the US not like to work on improving itself? Let us know in the comments section. Is the US finding allies for war on China? Do you want to watch more videos like this one?

@edwardmliger_video_7326661275763625258.txt," Like there's a colonial side to British Charity, it's true. Look at Yemen, right? We're the number one provider of weapons and bombs and expertise to Saudi Arabia that they use to bomb Yemen, to engineer a famine in Yemen.

What a hilarious, but also completely true and enlightening joke from the comedian Frankie Boyle. And I think George Carlin would have been proud of that one. Not only is he informing people about the Saudi bombing campaign in Yemen, which has been funded every step of the way by the US and UK, but he's also making us laugh with a joke about Yemen aid. And oftentimes the aid given to countries by the US and UK is just money for regime change or for protecting the West economic and political interests. They'll funnel it into a pro-Western political groups or use it for propaganda campaigns. The head of USAID right now is Samantha Power, who for her entire career has been a regime change advocate. During the Obama administration, she was one of the loudest voices pushing for the disastrous wars in Libya and Syria. She actually wrote a whole book arguing that the US needs to push for more regime change efforts in order to protect human rights around the world. And that's the person who's overseeing the aid that the US sends to other countries. And you can bet a lot of that aid is going towards carrying out regime change efforts in, say, Venezuela or Iran.

They're saying disabling cyber attacks are striking water and wastewater systems. They're worried about it disrupting the critical lifeline of clean and safe drinking water. Right on the front page of the letter from the White House, they point to two recent examples. One from my ran and two from China. And a lot of times these nation-state attacks are really sophisticated. But in this case, they just use the default manufacturer password. But those two attacks didn't cause much damage. So what the government is worried about is that these attackers are compromising these systems and then prepositioning them. So basically lying and waiting in order to disrupt critical infrastructure whenever they see fit. The letter goes on to basically beg for support from those running the critical infrastructure network.

@theaviationtimes_video_7302352083087363335.txt," Have you ever wondered about the difference between embassies and consulate offices? What do they do? And why do governments have both? And when do they opt for one over the other? Stick around, because in this video, we'll explain these diplomatic entities and their functions. So, subscribe now, and let's get into it. To get started, let's first clarify what an embassy is and what a consulate is. An embassy is a diplomatic office, which represents a foreign country's government, in a host country. An embassy usually houses an ambassador, from that foreign country, where he or she works, and is tasked to carry vital duties, ranging from international diplomacy, intelligence and liaison issues, as well as internal embassy administration, and support. A consulate, on the other hand, is a diplomatic office of a country, in a foreign country. It is usually a subordinate to the embassy, but may operate independently, in some cases. In most cases, however, consulates provide many of the same services, and carry out the same official functions, as the embassy, but on a smaller scale. Consulates are headed by consuls, who are responsible for providing consular services, to citizens of the home country, living or traveling in the consular district. Here are some of the few key functions of embassies. Embassies are crucial for maintaining diplomatic relations, between two countries. Ambassadors, who are like the chief diplomats, are stationed at embassies to represent their home country's interests, and facilitate communication. Embassies also often issue visas to foreigners, who wish to visit or immigrate, to their country. They review visa applications, conduct interviews, and decide whether an applicant meets the criteria for entry. Ambassadors and embassy staff also engage in political dialogue, with the host country. They negotiate treaties, discuss international issues, and foster cooperation. Consulate offices, on the other hand, may play the following roles. Firstly, consulate offices may provide services to their own citizens, living or traveling in the foreign country. This may include issuing passports, offering legal assistance, and providing advice during emergencies. Consulate offices may also promote economic ties, by assisting businesses from their home country, in the host nation. They can help with trade negotiations, investment opportunities, and resolving commercial disputes. Consulates may also be tasked to organize cultural events, exhibitions, and educational programs to foster cultural understanding and collaboration, between the two nations. Before we continue, if you're enjoying this video, please give it a thumbs up, by pressing the like button, and remember to share it with your friends. Now, let's continue. So, why would a government elect to have both an embassy, and consulate offices? Larger countries, with extensive diplomatic relations, typically have more embassies and consulates. This is to manage their complex international interactions, effectively. Consulates are sometimes strategically placed in different cities, within a host country, to ensure efficient support for their citizens, and facilitate economic activities. Another reason for having both entities is that, an embassy will usually focus on high level diplomacy, while consulates handle a wide range of practical matters. This makes it easier to divide responsibilities. In conclusion, embassies and consulates play important roles, in maintaining and promoting diplomatic relations, between countries. They are essential for communication, cooperation, and understanding between different cultures. They also provide essential services to citizens of the sending country, living or traveling abroad. So, which services have you used in an embassy, or a consulate office, and were they helpful? Please share your thoughts on their roles and functions, in the comments section below. With that, we've come to the end of this video, on the difference between embassies and consulate offices, and their functions. So, thank you for watching.

@everythingecon_video_7071966187562880262.txt," Do economic sanctions ever work? A key research paper found that sanctions were at least partially successful 34% of the time. They found that sanctions can work, but it really depends on what you're trying to achieve. For smaller objectives, sanctions can be quite effective. For example, in 1988, the United States threatened to withhold the economic aid from El Salvador and successfully stop them from releasing prisoners. Sanctions were much less effective at stopping a country's military operations, where they only worked around 20% of the time. A country is very unlikely to stop an action that it uses vital to its national security, no matter how heavy the economic costs are. However, it's difficult to say exactly how often sanctions work because they primarily act as a deterrent. The threat of future sanctions may have stopped any number of wars before they even started. Once a country has gone to war, it's already decided it's willing to accept the economic consequences, so it usually takes stronger action to achieve the desired result.

I do believe that Zionism is the best option for Jewish people trying to escape the very serious amounts of violence they've been facing in places like Russia and Eastern Europe for the past century. So can I count on your support here? So if I'm here and you're correct, you want me to support the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine. Well, that's a little tricky. But ultimately, I think it's a good idea. I just have one quick question. Will the Jewish people here in America want to relocate to this new Jewish National Home in Palestine? Like, will all the Jews here leave here and go there? Well, I don't think all of them want to relocate, but I imagine many Jewish Americans will. Great. That's all I wanted to hear because you know I'm a Southern Democrat, I'm a good old boy, and I'm all about keeping it wasp. You know what I'm saying? White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant. And if you ain't that, and I can get you to go somewhere else, you know what I'm talking about. I can get black people to go back to a black National Home somewhere in Africa. You think I can swing that? They already have that. It's called Liberia, but most black Americans didn't want to go there. I know right. I want a dream. Anyway, it can't be for the rest of the US, but you got my support. Look, we all know what the situation is in the Middle East, and it's a goddamn cluster fuck. Apparently, we got Britain and France supporting Israel's invasion of Egypt. Wait a minute. Why is Israel invading Egypt again? Oh, apparently Egypt nationalized a Suez Canal and won't let the Israelis use it. I think the best course of action for the US would be to back Egypt and get Israel, to back the fuck off. Wait a minute. Why would we do that? Won't we the first country to even recognize the state of Israel? Look, of course we still support Israel and it's right to exist. But this is a very delicate situation. There are a lot of interests here. We have the balances. It's very complicated. What's so complicated about it? We support Israel, right? Oh my God. Do I have to fucking spell this out for you? Oh, I, ale, bitch. We need oil, okay? We are at peak industrialization in America right now. And Egypt got that oil on lock. There's also a bunch of other Arab countries in that region that have oil. And we want to be on their good side too. We also don't want those countries to fall to communism and that's the most important thing right now. So we're going to support Israel. But in this particular instance, we're going to support Egypt. There's going to be a lot of that from now on. Supporting both sides, depending on how it suits our needs. So we're basically going to be some fence-round motherfuckers, okay? I can dig it. I don't want to wait to look at it. But look, we're still going to give money to Israel. You know, we're going to give them money for food and stuff like that, humanitarian aid. And I imagine by the early 1960s, we will eventually start selling them some weapons, but we're also going to keep selling weapons to Egypt and Jordan. But what I mean, Israel is that wall with Egypt and Jordan hates Israel. Why would we sell weapons to all three of them? I mean, what's the objective there? What do you think the objective is there?

@educate_yself_video_7243219968228232494.txt," I think it's really important to get to negotiations and to understand the roots of this war. This war came because we kept pushing NATO. And at the end of 2021, Putin put on the table, actually. You want to avoid war? Here is a draft. Russia, US security treaty. And it had several points, the most important of which is stop the NATO expansion. And you know what the White House said? No way we're going to talk to Russia about NATO expansion. That's our business. It has nothing to do with Russia. Of course, it has to do with Russia. We're about to put NATO right up against the Russian border. And so this was calamityously misguided foreign policy in the United States. And it's not just me saying it, the leading American diplomats have been saying this for decades now. Don't do this. George Kennen, William Burns, who's our CIA director right now, warned about this in 2008. And William Perry, who was our Clinton's Secretary of Defense, nearly resigned over Clinton deciding to enlarge NATO because Perry was saying, don't we're going to start another Cold War with Russia? So it's possible to negotiate. But it's actually been strangely enough, the United States that has absolutely rejected diplomacy. Americans probably couldn't believe that. But it's actually true. And it's at least two recent occasions. One is at the end of 2021 when Putin was putting a diplomatic initiative on the table. And we said, no, we're not going to talk about it, NATO enlargements. None of your business. That's what we told the Russians. And then at the start of the invasion, just a couple weeks after the invasion, Zelensky said, all right, okay, we could think about neutrality. We should negotiate. Now I know what happened there because I've spoken to people that were deeply involved in this. Right at the beginning, the Ukrainian said, you know, we could really go to, we don't have to be a NATO. We could have guarantees from other ways. And the Russians said, okay, let's talk. And the Turkish diplomats said, we'll mediate. And so real mediation started. And actually the former Prime Minister of Israel, Naftali Bennett, got into the act as an informal mediator towards the end of March 2022. They actually were working on the draft agreement to end the war. I talked about more than a year ago. And the United States said no. The United States said no diplomacy. Nobody questioned that in the mainstream media here because when's the last time you read in the New York Times a real understanding of this war? It doesn't exist in the New York Times. They just want you to follow what the US government says. And so if the US government says it's all Russia, they don't want to negotiate. Okay, then the New York Times will say it's all Russia, they don't want to negotiate. But for those of us who are there watching, seeing, talking, it's so different. We could negotiate this till today. And we're not even trying. And we're not trying because Victoria Newland doesn't want to try. Every time this issue of negotiation comes out, no, no, it's not the time. And actually when General Milley said, this is the time for negotiation.

@everythingecon_video_7070236547324349701.txt," Will the Russian economy collapse? After the latest economic sanctions from the West, Russia's currency, the Rubell, fell by around 30%. Sanctions have limited Russia's ability to transact in foreign currencies, frozen the assets of Russian banks, and cut them off from the swift messaging system. The Rubell falling in value will cause a number of problems. While Russia exports a lot of oil and gas, many other sectors of its economy rely on imports. As their currency falls in value, imports will become very expensive to buy, causing inflation. Even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the inflation rate was at nearly 9%, and this will only go higher. The Russian central bank has already more than doubled interest rates to 20%, but this won't be enough. Without access to currencies like the dollar in the euro, they may end up printing more money. This could lead to hyperinflation and a financial crisis.

@econchrisclarke_video_7068798582098234670.txt," It's briefly talked about some sanctions. Sanctions primarily function by limiting trade. But as any economist will tell you, economic transactions are often mutually beneficial, meaning cutting off those transactions will likewise be mutually harmful. The Peterson Institute for International Economics studied 115 sanctions from World War 1 through 1990. They found out that around 35% of those sanctions were at least partially successful. They highlight four attributes of those successes. Number one, you have a modest goal, ending a conflict early rather than ousting a regime. That's why it never worked in Cuba. Second, the sanctioned economy usually needs to be much smaller. Number three, that needs to be significant trade between the countries beforehand. Successful sanctioners accounted for 28% of the target country's trade, but only 19% in the failures on average. Number four, the sanctions have to be substantial. Number one's were 2.4% of GDP as opposed to 1% of GDP for the unsuccessful. So what about Russia? While the Russian economy is 10 times smaller than the US economy, average successful sanctions were for economies 187 times smaller. Now, Russia, compared to the EU and America together, makes that 20 times smaller, which helps, but the question remains whether Europe is willing to cut them off that severely. They are far more dependent on Russia's primary export petroleum products. The United States just doesn't engage in that much trade directly with Russia. Unamis are trillions of dollars and trade is measured in barely tens of billions. But let's talk about Swift. That is Belgium International Finance Payment Communication Platform. Back during the 2014 Crimea annexation, it was estimated that cutting Russia off from Swift would harm their GDP by 5%. That's substantial. However today, it likely won't be that much for two reasons. Because of those threats, Russia has since developed their own version of it, albeit an inferior one. And second, in order for Europe to pay for those Russian oil imports, Russia has to stay on Swift. There are talks of making an energy industry exception for a potential Russia Swift ban.",subjective

It is completely free of charge for veterans, partners of veterans, caregivers of veterans, and employees. So what do they offer? They offer crisis counseling, ongoing support, evidence-based therapy for those using aggression, and those experiencing intimate partner violence. And it is completely free. Also, if you are the partner of a veteran or the caregiver of a veteran, they do not let your veteran know that you are using the program. So they either create a chart for you, or they document on what's called a report of contact and store it in a secure location. So how do you get in touch with one of these IPV coordinators? You can self-refer. You do not have to wait for a doctor to refer you or a therapist to refer you. So let me show you. You're going to go to socialwork.va.gov. Click on directory of intimate partner violence assistance program coordinators. Find your state. And then click on the city that's nearest to you, and you can pick up the phone and call them yourself and say, hey, I'm the partner of a veteran, and I'm experiencing intimate partner violence, and I need help. Alright, it is that simple. Now, just a reminder, they will not send you reminder calls or reminder letters in the mail because they want this to be very, very confidential. If you are the partner or caregiver of a veteran, as soon as you make that call, you are then treated as though you are a patient of the VA and HIPAA rules and laws apply. So if you do want your records, you are going to have to sign that release of information. The same as a veteran would have to. Alright, everyone. If you have any questions, just go here and click on a state near you and you can call and ask the coordinator questions if you would like to learn more about the program.

@hebalsheikh_video_7315972889981865246.txt," The United States CIA is Israel. They are one in the same. The CIA was established in September 1947. In November 1947, two months later, the U.N. proposed the two-state solution between Israel and Palestine. When Palestine refused, that is what kickstarted the Arab-Israel war. By May 1948, the Nakhba had happened and they had displaced 750,000 Palestinians. Oh my gosh, my Toma got Tunis. By the way, did you know that Masad, the Israeli intelligence agency, actually means Central Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations in Hebrew? The Central Intelligence Agency? The CIA was established for Israel. And it is known to be so corrupt, so secretive, they have admitted to purposely staging so many coups all around the world, which were all very strategic, by the way. Very strategic in a sense of literally trying to take over the world because if you haven't noticed already, that is exactly what they are trying to do. The first one they admitted to was in Iran in 1953 and I talked about this a couple of videos ago, but they purposely staged a coup to prevent Iran from nationalizing their oil industry. Because if we look at the top oil producers in the Middle East, so Adiyah, which obviously they're just never going to take over for many reasons, followed by Iran, interesting, followed by Iraq, interesting, the two countries that they've admitted to purposely destabilizing to steal their resources. And I talked about before how it's strategic even in a geographical sense. They've also admitted to a coup in the Congo, which we all know what is happening there, the genocide that is happening at the hands of America and Israel. The Congo is not only the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa, second to Algeria, which is in North Africa, which is usually grouped with the Middle East, but it's also smack dab in the middle of the continent. And not only does it supply 80% of the world's coal-tanned and coal-bolt, but it is estimated to have $28 trillion of unexploited minerals. They've also staged a coup in Vietnam, which obviously had a lot to do with the Vietnam War, which was also strategic though because not only would it give them ground next to China, but it would allow them to be around a vast amount of water and also close to other Asian countries and then also close to Australia. They've also staged a coup in Dominican Republic, which I love this one because guess who's neighbors with the Dominican Republic? Epstein's Island. And then obviously Puerto Rico is already a part of the U.S. They've also staged a coup in Guatemala, which I don't know enough about the country's resources, but I know that it's huge on agriculture, which if you're a white supremacist trying to dip your dirty little fingers in every economy in the world, I guess that's the missing piece. But also geographically, again, it would allow them to corner Mexico in because then they'd have Guatemala and the United States directly above it. And Cuba, which oh, they have so much beef with Cuba for so long. So Guatemala would also allow them to kind of corner Cuba in as well. And then they staged one in Brazil and Chile, which varies strategically on opposite sides of South America. And they're both huge on mining. They're two of the contents top three countries with the most resources, mostly for diamonds and gold. So places that they have tried or succeeded in destabilizing by staging coups include Guatemala, Dominican Republic, Chile, Brazil, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Iraq, Vietnam. The only places that they haven't interfered in tried destabilizing are Russia and China, which we know that this is why they absolutely despise them because they cannot touch them. And then Canada and Europe, which if you're not getting the hint already, this is the agenda of white supremacists to take over the world.

@praxben_video_7119836862130392366.txt, What would happen to the Cuban economy if dispreied with the West were suddenly cut off? I've never heard that quote or seen that clip before. It was very interesting to see for a variety of reasons But I'm actually not surprised to hear him say that so the truth is he was pretty correct Not a lot happened after the embargo went into place now the embargo really started in 1962 and the reason it was put in the place was because of US land that was taken away But the reason it didn't really have any initial effects is because originally they actually replaced the US with the USSR as a trading partner The biggest and most thorough study done the effects of the Cuban economy because of the embargo is this one right here They point out Cuba adjusted quickly to US economic sanctions through political and economic alliance with the Soviet block countries The Soviet economic assistance which peaked that nearly six billion annually in the 1980s largely offset any adverse Effects of US sanctions that enabled the Cuban economy to grow But of course the Soviet Union eventually fell and Cuba is still around the loss of Soviet economic assistance after 1990 caused a severe downturn in the Cuban economy bringing to the forefront long-standing inefficiencies with the Cuban economy the loss of Soviet assistance eventually forced Cuba to introduce Economic reforms to attract foreign investment and selective economic liberalization to stimulate domestic production This period is known as the Cuban economic crisis of the 1990s the liberalization policies They implemented to offset the loss of Soviet assistance did very well But of course the embargo still caused massive problems and that's one of the reasons of against the embargo I think it's a violation of human rights of private property of a lot of things even though initially it didn't have extreme effects Even if this time it didn't have extreme effects. I would still be against it Another reason I'm against it is because as Castro admitted in 1967 in something that's very reminiscent to the Shagavara interview Castro said that the embargo had been effective in favor of the revolution many researchers have pointed out that Castro actually gained Favor because of the embargo. This is because it gave people a common enemy to hate It's really sad that that whole situation didn't go a better way Instead we had our own United States government tried to stage a false flag and kill US citizens in order to justify war with Cuba But thankfully there's still good news in surveys of Cuban opinion a majority of Cubans do support more private ownership of business Becoming friends with the US and having another round of liberalization would definitely help out the Cuban people a lot of Socialists like to make it seem like Cubans are doing just fine But this doesn't really the case they point to infant mortality rates and life expectancy But these things really don't hold up.

The base is guarded by Kurdish fighters affiliated with a local military force known as the Syrian Democratic Forces SDF, which has been a major US partner in the fight against IS, also known as Daesh. We support the SDF and their security operations to counter Daesh, to counter ISIS, and that really hasn't been a change to our mission at this point. The fight continues against Daesh. We can continuously look at degrading their capabilities, both from command and control, and the ability for them to take and or hold any land. To that end, US troops conduct regular patrol missions in the area in coordination with local SDF fighters. The patrols have a tactical advantage of knowing what is going on within your area. Obviously, if we stay behind these walls, we won't truly understand the severity of what's going on. But also, it is an enjoyable experience because we get to see how welcoming the locals are to us, and they're able to grief their concerns to us of anything that they want us to be aware of that we can potentially help with.

@geohussar_video_7309935448468573483.txt," The US said Russia to help the American economy. Herding Russia was just a side benefit. This is a chart of United States oil exports, and as you can see, we are exporting more oil than we ever have. This huge jump that we saw happened as tensions between Russia and Ukraine were escalating and skyrocketed all the way here once Russia invaded. In fact, the US exports two million barrels of oil per day to the euro zone. Since the US is switching to renewables, we will need oil less, which means we could export it more, but it's not just energy we're dominating. We are also the world's top food exporter. Tragically, for the world, the United States is also making a killing as the world's top weapons exporter. So the more violent the world gets, the more this country profits that's sad. In fact, ever since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, our exports have gone up from about 230 billion to 260 billion dollars per month. However, country in the world is seeing its export rise this quickly. Usually, our exports only rise when the dollar is weak, but the dollar is in fact extremely strong since it's at 103 on the DXY, which means there is an incredibly strong demand around the world for US produced goods. US isn't just sanctioning Russia, they are sanctioning any entity that is associated with helping Russia. So a lot of Chinese firms, of course Iran and other firms and government entities have been sanctioned as well. All these sanctions are doing are helping the US control the food supply, the energy supply, the weapons supply, and the money supply. China, India, and the Eurozone are all at risk of facing deflation. The US is probably the only country that can open the faucet of relief. I don't think the US is gonna do that anytime soon because they are reshuffling their global dominance cards. American politicians, including most of the voters, aren't really gonna do anything about it because we're too caught up in idiotic identity politics instead of actually dealing with the huge wealth and equality and power gap between the poor people and the people who have everything. As long as that recipe keeps working, which it does, then the American power system just keeps stacking the cards in their own favor at the expense of the American voters and the rest of the world. The kicker is that the United States doesn't need a World War II-like event to be doing what they're doing. And of course, there are a lot of idiotic articles like this saying, oh, the Russia sanctions aren't working which is total nonsense because Russia is selling a lot of their oil illegally, which is much more expensive than just doing it through the conventional means. So whatever money Russia does manage to scrape by is so much less than what they could have gained if there were no sanctions. And every country that is directly supporting Russia is suffering economically while the US just seems to keep making more money. The United States has managed to tariff their largest competitors, Russia and China and completely get away with it. And I'm not saying this has some patriotic pro-American rent.

Paying a $15 million ransom, days before MGM was breached. MGM resorts now working with local law enforcement, the FBI and cybersecurity experts. They say they're working diligently to get back online. Whether this was ransomware, whether this was malware, one would have to think that this was a fairly sophisticated group that launched the attack. Cybersecurity analysts tell ABC News a Russian-speaking hacking network provided the ransomware used in the MGM attack to a group known as scattered spider, a hacker allegedly impersonating an MGM employee talking on the phone with their help desk was able to take down the entire MGM system in just 10 minutes.

@sstout1984_video_7274936175796800810.txt," Most of you don't know that coronavirus as a model of a pathogen was isolated in 1965. Coronavirus was identified in 1965 as one of the first infectious replicable viral models that could be used to modify a series of other experiences of human condition. It was isolated once upon a time associated with the common cold. What's particularly interesting about its isolation in 1965 was that it was immediately identified as a pathogen that could be used and modified for a whole host of reasons. And you heard me correctly, that was 1965. And by the way, these slides are public domain. You're welcome to look at every single reference. Every comment that I made is based on published material. So do make sure that you look at those references. But in 1966, the very first COV coronavirus model was used as a transatlantic biological experiment in human manipulation. And you heard the date 1966. I hope you're getting the point of what I'm saying. This is not an overnight thing. This is actually something that's been long in the making. A year before I was born, we had the first transatlantic coronavirus data sharing experiment between the United States and the United Kingdom. And in 1967, the year I was born, we did the first human trials on inoculating people with modified coronavirus. Is that amazing? 56 years ago, the overnight success of a pathogen that's been 56 years in engineering. And I want that to chill with all of you. Where were we when we actually allowed in violation of biological and chemical weapons treaties? Where were we as a human civilization? When we thought it was an acceptable thing to do to take a pathogen for the United States and infect the world with it? Where was that conversation? And what should have been that conversation in 1967? That conversation wasn't had. Ironically, the common cold was turned into a chimera in the 1970s. And in 1975, 1976 and 1977, we started figuring out how to modify coronavirus by putting it into different animals, pigs and dogs. And not surprisingly, by the time we got to 1990, we found out that coronavirus as an infectious agent was an industrial problem for two primary industries, the industries of dogs and pigs. Dog breeders and pigs found that coronavirus created gastrointestinal problems. And that became the basis for Pfizer's first spike protein vaccine pattern. Filed, are you ready for this? In 1990. Did you hear what I just said? 1990. Operation warp speed? I'm sorry. It was the warp and the speed. Pfizer 1990, the very first spike protein vaccine for coronavirus. Isn't that fascinating? Isn't it fascinating that we were told that the spike protein is a new thing? We just found out that that's the problem. No. As a matter of fact, we didn't just find out it was not just now the problem. We found that out in 1990 and filed the first patents on vaccines in 1990 for the spike protein of coronavirus. And who would have thought, Pfizer? Clearly the innocent organization that does nothing but promote human health. Clearly Pfizer. The organization that has not bought the votes in this chamber in every chamber of every government around the world, not that Pfizer. Certainly they wouldn't have had anything to do with this. But oh yes, they did. And in 1990, they found out that there was a problem with vaccines. They didn't work. You know why they didn't work? It turns out that coronavirus is a very malleable model. It transforms and it changes and it mutates over time. And as a matter of fact, every publication on vaccines for coronavirus from 1990 until 2018, every single publication concluded that coronavirus escapes the vaccine impulse because it modifies and mutates too quickly for vaccines to be effective. And since 1990 to 2018, that is the published science, ladies and gentlemen. It's following the science. Following the science is their own indictment of their own programs that said it doesn't work. And there are thousands of publications to that. In fact, not a few hundred. And not paid for by pharmaceutical companies. These are publications that are independent scientific research that shows unequivocally, including efforts of the Camero modifications made by Ralph Berick in the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, all of them show vaccines do not work on coronavirus. That's the science. And that science has never been disputed. But then we had an interesting development in 2002. And this date is most important. Because in 2002, the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill patented and I quote an infectious replication defective clone of coronavirus. In those words, infectious replication defective. What does that phrase actually mean? For those of you not familiar with language, let me unpack it for you. Infectious replication defective means a weapon. It means something meant to target an individual, but not have collateral damage to other individuals. That's what infectious replication defective means. And that patent was filed in 2002 on work funded by NIAID's Anthony Fauci from 1999 to 2002. And that work patented at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill mysteriously preceded SARS 1.0 by a year. Dave, are you suggesting that SARS 1.0 wasn't from a wet market in the world? In Wuhan? Are you suggesting it might have come from a laboratory in the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill? No, I'm not suggesting it. I'm telling you, that's the facts. We engineered SARS. SARS is not a naturally occurring phenomenon. The naturally occurring phenomenon is called the common cold. It's called influenza-like illness. It's called gastroenteritis. That's the naturally occurring coronavirus. SARS is the research developed by humans weaponizing a life system model to actually attack human beings. And they patented it in 2002.",subjective
@big_lew_3.0_video_7174633017883790635.txt," Our second stop in New York City is the United Nations headquarters, which was built in 1945 and financed largely by John D Rockefeller. Inside UN headquarters is an ominous meditation room. The custodian of the meditation room is Lucis Trust Company. At one time, the Lucis Trust was located at 666 United Nations Plaza and was formally named Lucifer Publishing Company. The Rockefeller funded UN meditation room is 33 feet long and 18 feet wide. 18 feet is 6 plus 6 plus 6. The small dimly lit windowless room was built in the shape of a pyramid that is laying on its side. At the center of the room is a four foot high black casket-shaped stone slab, which weighs 6.5 tons and is extremely magnetic and rests on a concrete pillar. The pillar descends beneath the floor into the bedrock and taps into the earth's hyper-dimensional energies to induce a state of altered consciousness. Not far from the meditation room is the United Nations Security Council chamber. This is the emergency room of the UN, where the world leaders meet when there is a threat to peace. They decide the fate of nations. Even though Israel has over 200 unexpected nuclear weapons and has violated dozens of resolutions, no sanctions are ever imposed because of the United States' veto powers. Notice the giant mural that towers over the Security Council room. The central focus of the UN mural is the Phoenix Bird that has risen. The Phoenix Bird is a symbol of Lucifer. Egyptians believe that the Phoenix symbolized a god who rose to heaven in the form of a morning star like Lucifer after his fire emulation of death and rebirth. Notice that the Phoenix Bird is not standing above his own ashes. He is standing above his old skin. Like a snake, he has shed his old skin and is revealing himself as god at the center of the mural. At the top left, there is a church steeple without a cross. The missing cross symbolizes the death of Christianity. Below, a woman receives the rays of the sun god, while the man in front of her plays Pan's flute. To their right are two pyramid symbols and people joined together by a long blue serpent-like hawk. Below the risen Phoenix, a sword is driven through a dragon beast. This represents the killing of the Phoenix.",subjective

We're finding it difficult and I think that the current where we're doing it just isn't really working very well. What it's intended to do is make it a bit more difficult to come into Europe that those that are seeking refugee status that are genuine will of course be taken care of but that processing times will be quicker that those that are not entitled to refugee status will be sent back and I think one really good thing out of it that I picked up on yesterday was signing up to this common EU database, the Eurodap regulation and that would make it a lot easier for Irish authorities to know if somebody coming into Ireland has claimed to sign up somewhere else first and also there's any information that we need to know about in terms of previous history.

But let's not get too far into those details. Let's look at the good news and the shining lights that we are seeing for some unbelievably sad, persecuted Americans. The best that we can do, ladies and gentlemen, is report on these cases and this one is an important one.

Whoever corrupt Lee, and this is what they're really looking at the Supreme Court, all of the destroyers, mutilates, concealers, record document, or other object or attempts to do so with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability of use of an official proceeding. So destruction of evidence effectively or like hiding evidence from a committee or something of the government. Otherwise, obstructs, influences or impedes any official proceeding or attempts to do so shall be fine under this title or in prison, not more than 20 years or both. So this is the section of the legal code that they are charging like thousands of people on January 6, this is a very novel legal theory and it is facing such uphill battles that the Supreme Court has now taken it up to say, wait a second, you are clearly misinterferting this statute to effectively say that people who wittingly or unwittingly like were part of a riot at worst or just like a peaceful protest at best were somehow like obstructing an official proceeding just by wandering around.
