@nowthisimpact_video_7348197098854108458.txt," We need to talk about project 2025. He says, you're not going to be a dictator. Are you? I said, don't know, no, other than day one created by Trump's long time allies at the Heritage Foundation, along with more than a hundred other conservative groups. A 920 page document outlines conservatives plan to rescue the country from the grip of the radical left. It means that if Trump is elected, the GOP would attempt to implement over reaching bills like the ones popping up in Florida, Texas, Alabama, and other red states, federally. The document says the GOP will reach its goals by using presidential power to bypass Congress and by destroying what they call the administrative state, which refers to the agencies that try to ensure clean and safe air, food, water, drugs, and consumer products. And that also hold big corporations back for making more money. So that's what Trump means by day one. He plans to fire and replace tens of thousands of government employees who don't agree with them to elevate his power. And yes, he can do that. First, I will immediately reissue my 2020 executive order restoring the president's authority to remove rogue bureaucrats. And I will wield that power very aggressively. All right, let's dive into this document. When I searched the term sex, 133 matches came up. That's obsessive. It explicitly states their goal to rescind regulations prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, and sex characteristics. So queer people could legally be fired, not hired, refused, serviced, or otherwise discriminated against. It also proposes deleting the term sexual orientation, DEI, gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender sensitive abortion, reproductive health, and reproductive rights from every piece of legislation that exists. That's terrifying because it promotes discrimination against LGBTQI plus and pregnant people. In speaking of pregnant people, it also proposes pushing as hard as possible to protect the unborn in every jurisdiction in America. A.K.A. and National Abortion Band, they plan to go after education too, just like they have in red states. The authors propose eliminating the entire Department of Education, which they say injects racist, anti-American, A-Historical propaganda into America's classrooms. As part of its economic policy, it wants to eliminate regulatory and procedural barriers for companies and prop up the oil industry, which it says is not an environmental problem. This is all just the tip of the iceberg. It's a document filled with endless contradictions going back and forth between ideas of big government and small, going after monopolies but reducing corporate taxes and regulation, saying they're for freedom but policing people's bodies, gender, and sexuality. And, it's a document created by the Heritage Foundation, which has ties to fossil fuel billionaire Charles Koch and is swirling with controversies. Throughout, they dehumanize the left in ways that make me afraid of how much more emboldened far-right Republicans will feel to target vulnerable people.",subjective

And that is why I am authorizing the sale of defensive weapons to the state of Israel. Gonna sell on some anti-aircraft missiles. The best on the market. Whoa, timeout. I thought we were just gonna sell on some hand-ons. You're talking about selling them some very serious military equipment. Isn't there an embargo on selling Israel that type of stuff? Well, I have a certain fondness for the Israeli people. They have a strengthen that I resolved that I admire. And I believe it is our duty to help protect those people in that dangerous region. Not to mention we have congressional elections right around the corner. It wouldn't necessarily be the worst thing in the world if the Jewish people here in America found out that I was the first US president to sell weapons directly to the state of Israel. If I'm hearing you correctly, are you saying the only reason you're selling weapons to Israel is so you can get more Jewish people here in America to support your party during the midterms? Hey, I never said that. However, when this deal goes through, make sure we are now set in New York City, particularly in Brooklyn, and make sure we are now set in Boko Raton. Well, that was pretty transparent. However, I do want you to be aware that we have some intelligence coming in telling us that Israel is developing its first nuclear facility. Hold up. They're doing what they're now? Let's cut to the chase. Now, a little birdie told me that you all were developing a nuclear facility in Israel.

However, under no circumstances, are you all to be developing nuclear weapons in Israel? Whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down, Kennedy. Okay, you know me better than that. We're not developing nuclear weapons over here. We're developing a nuclear reactor for energy and peaceful purposes, man.

@sinixstar5.0_video_7333414541360958762.txt," Complete honesty, you're not wrong. It is not uncommon for there to be fights. It is not uncommon for there to be screaming matches. It is not uncommon for people to be asked to leave for being disruptive or being overly aggressive. Those are things that do happen. Because it's not like there's just like, okay, you catch your vote and this is the winner and we all go home. It's an ongoing process. There's typically two or three ballots and you're in a room with all these people and you can interact with them. It's not uncommon ahead of the caucuses for campaigns to reach out to people that they know our supporters and say, hey, here's information about the campaign. Here's campaign talking points. Here's the policy positions. Make sure you're informed. Because it's a very interactive process. You're in a room with these people. You can talk to people and try to get to change their mind and try to get them to come over to your side. Not everybody is friendly about it. The caucus I went to in 2008, we had a couple of people show up the so-called Hillary's Tigers. If you remember that movement in the 2008 primary, they came in and it was really fucking obvious right off the bat that they were trying to provoke people. Basically what they were trying to do is provoke reactions from people so that they would be asked to leave. They were targeting Obama supporters and they were trying to start arguments with Obama supporters and trying to start fights with Obama supporters, hoping somebody would fly off the handle and get asked to leave. Luckily, where I was and that wasn't an uncommon thing in 2008 from what I understand. I talked to several people that had a similar experience. Where I was, the person running the caucus was really quick to be like, hey, you're going to be respectful or you can fucking go. Those are your choices. Be respectful. Get yourself under control. Cut the shit or there's the door and they chose to leave. The irony is there were like two or three of them and if I recall, Hillary only lost by like two votes. If they would have just stayed, if they were to just acted normal and stayed, she would have won that precinct. But that's not why they were there. They were there to start shit and get other people thrown out. That kind of shit does happen. Especially in this political climate, I can completely understand supporters of somebody like Nikki Haley not wanting to show up at a caucus in a room full of fucking Trump supporters. In a room full of people that threatening to go to fucking war for Trump, I can completely understand people not wanting to be in that room. Which is why I find it so amusing that the Republican Party fought so hard for fucking caucuses. Now, I don't know where the majority of the caucuses were held in the bad. I haven't looked into it that much. But if it wasn't run by the state and it wasn't run by the official, like, hey, this is the official election, I imagine it happened at Republican County headquarters at the county party offices or something like that or restaurants or whatever, which are probably not going to be very big places and they can probably pretty easily easily control who comes in and who doesn't. So when I said, like, just looking at the circumstances and how this unfolded, it's pretty fucking clear that the Republicans had their thumb on the scale. Yeah, it's pretty fucking clear.",subjective

@theprogressiveparamedic_video_7298111710995467563.txt," One year until the 2024 United States presidential election, it's Tuesday, November 5th, 2024, and here's everything you need to know. I tried making this before and it wouldn't upload TikTok hates me. Below in yellow are the states that the consensus that 270 to win.com have, for the states that in best case and worst case scenarios could go Democrat or Republican. And to start simply both major parties, the Republicans and the Democrats could possibly win a trifecta. That is full control over the presidency, executive branch, as well as both chambers of the legislative branch. Now, our country is operated under a two party system for most of its existence. The merits of that can be debated. But I'm operating under the belief that although there will be a possibly large and influential effect by third party candidates in the 2024 election, there's no scenario. I can currently envision that doesn't result in either the Democratic or Republican parties winning the 270 electoral votes needed to become president. Here's a quick look at the party system. In the United States, it's very interesting. Some would say there's seven party eras, but basically since 1860, it's been the Democrats and the Republican in some version. This is the 2020 map and where we left off before. And remember, a rematch is not yet set in stone before anything. We have the primaries. Trump is still firing away the main choice for most Republicans and Biden is plus 60 over his only real competitor right now as Williamson. Here's the list of who's actually running for president right now. And in my opinion, the Republicans will go for Trump unless one anti-tremaponent can consolidate support early. And for Biden, I just feel like he's the only one being put put forth right now in the NC incumbent. So he's going to be the candidate that this below is the 2024 consensus map right now. There are five toss-ups, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin, Nevada, Georgia. And this is what I think the easiest path to 270 for the Democrats is maybe some of Wisconsin for Arizona, but same case, this is the primary schedule, post or read, super Tuesday's March 5th. And that's pretty much one will know who is going to run away with the Republican primary and the Democratic. And this is the earlier major candidate filing deadlines by state. As you can see, Nevada New Hampshire passed, but everything else hasn't yet. So if you still want a primary challenge to Joe Biden from a Democrat, you have some time, but you're running out of time.

@ky.deserves.moore_video_7317297478381079854.txt," Hey y'all, let's chat today about something most of you probably never think about. Caucuses are in our state legislature. Buckle up. You may have heard of the Republican caucus or the Democratic caucus, but there are more than 20 others in Kentucky state legislature. So what's a caucus? But simply, it's lawmakers who share a similar interest and may want a team up to work towards common goals. And these are open across party lines without the constraints and the rigidity of formal committees. So for example, we've got the women's caucus and they advocate for women's issues and is primarily made up of women legislators. There is a central Kentucky caucus focusing on local needs here and central Kentucky. And of course, being Kentucky, we have E-quine and Burmaterial caucuses that prioritize two of our state's premier unique industries. And here's something to think about. In our state legislature, there's no veterans caucus, no young family caucus, no disabilities caucus. And I imagine no group of veterans are those specifically looking out for our veterans who've given so much. No caucus made up of legislators working with young families who know exactly what Kentuckians like themselves are going through right now. And surprisingly, no caucus for legislators who are disabled themselves or have a special calling to help Kentuckians with disabilities. Now this post is not about playing the blame game or saying anyone's doing something wrong. Simply noticing that there are things that are missing. I know there are many who feel that the political system doesn't care about them, doesn't think about them, does not prioritize them, but those Kentucky voices matter. And caucuses might give them the attention that they deserve. One of the reasons Kentucky's deserve new legislators is because we need fresh perspectives and outside opinions. It's because it's the way we've always done it is never about excuse to remain stagnant with the past. As an army veteran and a father to a six year old son, I personally want to found caucuses for our veterans and our young families. And I hope other 2024 freshmen members bring their ideas to better represent all Kentuckians as well. Thank you.",subjective

Quote on quote, none of these candidates is the winner of the Republican presidential primary in Nevada, defeating real person Nikki Haley with 63.2% of the vote to 30.5%. So what happened here? Well, a new Nevada law requires each party to hold a primary. And of course, the states Republican party disagreed. So they've decided to also hold caucuses. But because a candidate can't be in both the primary and the caucus, Nikki Haley decided to be in the primary while Donald Trump decided to be in the caucus, which Trump is expected to win on Thursday with very little competition, receiving all delegates as the party is only choosing to recognize the caucus results because they want to back Trump.

President Wiley looked forward to this debate and we also mentioned that there are other things that we should be doing as well. The United States President Biden has urged Israel to change its tactics with regard to their indiscriminate bond. President Wiley will be the state department and ask Netanyahu over and over and over again. Unfortunately, the Netanyahu government has not listened and has not been terribly interested in our perspective despite the fact that we are supplying the bombs that they are using. Despite the fact that we have provided them with $3.5 billion every year for a long in military aid. Instead, the Netanyahu government is continuing its military approach, which is both immoral and in violation of international law. And in my view, Mr. President, the United States must end our complicity in those actions. And to do so, we must make two critical changes in our policy first, while it is appropriate to support defensive systems like I and Don't protect Israeli civilians, gets incoming rockets. It would be irresponsible to provide an additional 10.1 billion in military aid beyond those defensive systems as contained in the proposed supplemental foreign aid package. Bottom line, we should not be giving more money to a right-wing extremist government in Israel to conduct a horrific and immoral military campaign, which includes indiscriminate bombardment. Second, in my view, the United States should support efforts at the United Nations Security Council to end the bloodshed, such as a resolution expected tomorrow that we demand that I quote an urgent suspension of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access and for urgent steps toward a sustainable cessation of hostilities. As well as the unconditional release of all hostages. This should be something we strongly support. As you may recall last week, the United States vetoed a resolution, and I think that was disappointing not just to me, but to many Americans.

@teamkennedy2024_video_7278023890331241770.txt," In a real democracy, every citizen has the same prize possession. Their vote. That vote gives you a say in whether you can earn a good living, whether your kids have access to decent schools, whether they'll be sent to war and whether they'll get health care. When democracy crumbles, citizens become more like surfs, a labor underlaws that are made by oligarchs and elites. They work two jobs for barely livable pay. They get taxed to fund Wall Street and wars and bank bailouts. Your vote is your power. And right now, the Democratic Party elites are trying to take it away from you. At the order of President Biden, the DNC is punishing states where President Biden lost in 2020. He came in fourth, for example, in Iowa and finished laws, the New Hampshire. So the DNC is trying to move those states out of their historic first laws and start instead with South Carolina where President Biden finally won his first victory. What are you going to do about RFK Jr.? I'm very, very proud of the President and we're going to get it done for him and Kamala Harris in this primary and again in the general election. Those changes violate state laws. So the legislatures can't comply with the plan. But you know who the real losers are and you are. You're going to lose your right to vote in a free and fair election. Based upon the DNC's plan, if you live in the state of New Hampshire or Iowa, your vote just won't count. And Georgia too, by the way, in that state, they want to kick anyone off the ballot. If they campaigned in New Hampshire, these crooked measures will disenfranchise millions of citizens. These people will be robbed of their votes just because the elites say so. And it's not only voters in a handful of states that the DNC is trying to silence. It's every voter in every state. So how do they plan to do that? Oh, there's another rule that the committee is drafting behind closed doors. And it's similar to a trick that they use to kick Bernie Sanders out in 2016. They're flooding the convention with party operatives with opaque names like PLEO's and automatic delegates. Whose job is to drown out the popular vote. Once the PLEO's automatic delegates arrive at the Chicago Convention next summer, the vote tallies all change and the people's choice can be overturned in an instant. I could win two thirds of the popular vote and still be denied the domination. That's not democracy. That's theater. When I was growing up, this country was the democratic way to the world. We were the exemplar. We were the template for all the other nations on earth. This is what democracy looked like. We didn't better than anybody. Based upon our example, dozens upon dozens of new democracies took root in every corner of the earth. But when we deny citizens, they're right to vote. And when we rig the process in favor of insiders, then the flames of democracy flickers. And someday soon it will go out. The good news is these rules don't take effect until the DNC votes on them on September 14th. So let's use our power while we still have it. It's time to demand a fair, primary process where every vote counts equally. And the candidate who gets the most votes wins the nomination. That's the democracy we learned about in school. That's the democracy that people around the world yearn for. That's the democracy that we now have to fight to protect. Whenever you plan to vote for next year, now is the time to help DNC.

The number one piece of advice that I give to everyone that I consult with on crowdfunding is right personalized emails to every single person that you know and you would be shocked how many people just don't do this because it's uncomfortable. But it is seriously the number one way that you are going to get contributions. No, I mean it. The person that you worked with last year, friends that you went to high school with, your parents, friends, a college professor, everybody. Spend weeks preparing for your campaign, writing out, drafting these personal emails, include personal information, something with them, make a connection. Now, is part of this to make them feel pressure to contribute to your campaign? Yeah, you have to pressure them. Otherwise, you're just not going to do it. Listen, I hate asking people for money. It is really hard. I have done it four times successfully and it doesn't get any easier. But the more energy that you put into your campaign before you hit launch, the more likely you are to succeed. My favorite place for crowdfunding resources is CN Spark. The founder of CN Spark Emily has a whole series of videos on how to prepare for a launch. I highly recommend them. They are free. Go to CN Spark, find these videos. They'll make all the difference. Another thing that CN Spark does that I really like is they show you a bunch of their favorite pitch videos of the year every year. So you can call and kind of see what works. And another reason I like working with CN Spark is that they help tailor your campaign. So before you even launch, they have already gone over everything and will even have one-on-one consulting with you to help you be as successful as possible. Another thing I like to tell creators is when you create your rewards, try to do something digital and shareable. Stay away from posters and t-shirts. It costs money to print, it costs money to ship, it costs time, your time to ship out these things. I have done it. The best campaign to use rewards to market for you. So if you're good at Photoshop, take the picture of the person that gave you the contribution, Photoshop them into something that's related to your film, and that they'll want to then post on their social media and then other people will want their face Photoshopped into that thing that relates to your film. You feel it? But yeah, not to sound like a broken record. The more effort you put into your campaign, the more results you will get from your campaign. And remember, it's not just about raising money, it's about building your audience, which is then going to come with you to your next film and your next film. I promise you, I've done it.",subjective

And even if you use the 2020 election, it was less than a 7% win for Biden. Minnesota is a really good, bell-weather state for the national environment. I don't think that Biden's going to lose. Minnesota, I never said that. I think it's likely are. It'll be a 5% to 10% win, but I think people generally take, like, it for granted in terms of it's a little bit closer than people think.

@brutamerica_video_7343234907138755883.txt," Joe Biden again saw the uncommitted vote coming for him on Super Tuesday. Let me explain. In Minnesota, Democrat voters voted uncommitted rather than for Joe Biden more than in Michigan. About 19% of Minnesota Democrat voters statewide voted uncommitted, or about 46,000 votes. In Michigan, 12% of Democrat voters statewide chose uncommitted. The movement to vote uncommitted rather than for Joe Biden is largely a protest vote over Biden's support for Israel's war in Gaza. Most of the uncommitted votes came from the Minneapolis St. Paul area, where there is a large Muslim community. Representative Ilhan Omar represents Minneapolis in Congress. It has been an outspoken critic of Israel and the Biden administration's support for Israel in Gaza. Smiley community mainly will not vote for Biden. For a simple fact that he did not call to see us fired when over 30,000 civilians has been murdered. Both candidates are not favorable because they both have allegiance to Israel. It's not Minnesota Muslims. It's not the Muslims in the United States. It's really the overwhelming majority of Democrats who believe that the president is on a very dark course. It is a protest vote because we want as many people to come out and say to President Biden that we're uncommitted because of his policy on Gaza.",subjective

@teamkennedy2024dfs_video_7293977702283906346.txt," In a real democracy, every citizen has the same prize possession. Their vote. That vote gives you a say in whether you can earn a good living, whether your kids have access to decent schools, whether they'll be sent to war, and whether they'll get health care. When democracy crumbles, citizens become more like surfs, a labor under laws that are made by oligarchs and elites. They work two jobs for barely livable pay. They get taxed to fund Wall Street and wars and bank bailouts. Your vote is your power, and right now the Democratic Party elites are trying to take it away from you. At the order of President Biden, the DNC is punishing states where President Biden lost in 2020. He came in fourth, for example, in Iowa and finished laws in New Hampshire, so the DNC is trying to move those states out of their historic first laws, and started instead with South Carolina where President Biden finally won his first victory. What are you going to do about RFK Jr.? I'm very, very proud of the President, and we're going to get it done for him and Kamala Harris, in this primary and again in the general election. Those changes violate state laws, so the legislatures can't comply with the plan, but you know who the real losers are, you are. You're going to lose your right to vote, in a free and fair election. Based upon the DNC's plan, if you live in the state of New Hampshire or Iowa, your vote just won't count. And Georgia too, by the way, in that state they want to kick anyone off the ballot if they campaigned in New Hampshire. These crooked measures will disenfranchise millions of citizens. These people will be robbed of their votes just because the elites say so. And it's not only voters in a handful of states that the DNC is trying to silence. It's every voter in every state. So how do they plan to do that? Oh, there's another role that the committee is drafting behind closed doors, and it's similar to a trick that they use to kick Bernie Sanders out in 2016. They're flooding the convention with party operatives, with opaque names like PLEO's and automatic delegates whose job is to drown out the popular vote. Once the PLEO's and automatic delegates arrive at the Chicago Convention next summer, the vote tallies all change, and the people's choice can be overturned in an instant. I can win two-thirds the popular vote, and still be denied the nomination. That's not democracy. That's theater. When I was growing up, this country was the democratic white in the world. We were the exemplar. We were the template for all the other nations on earth. This is what democracy looked like. We did it better than anybody. Based upon our example, dozens upon dozens of new democracies took root in every corner of the earth. But when we deny citizens, they're right to vote, and when we rig the process in favor of insiders, then the flames of democracy flickers, and some days soon it will go out. The good news is these rules don't take effect until the DNC votes on them on September 14th. So let's use our power while we still have it. It's time to demand a fair, plundering process where every vote counts equally, and the candidate who gets the most votes wins the nomination. That's the democracy we learned about at school. That's the democracy that people around the world yearn for. That's the democracy that we now have to fight to protect. Whenever you plan to vote for next year, now is the time to help DNC. You want democracy back in the Democratic Party. Add your name to the demand a fair vote petition below, and please use your voice while you still can. I'm Robert F.

It's still a month out for now, but I just learned some new information I just wanted to share with you all. So I've been registered as a Democrat ever since I first registered back in high school, and I'm planning on voting for RFK Jr. and he's not running as a Democrat. As you can see, the ballot says Democratic Party ballot, and for the president, it only has Democratic options. And even if you were to put anything in the dotted line, unless it was a Democrat, it would make your vote in valid supposedly. So I started to Google it, and I reached out to my counties, a register of voters, and they let me know that I would have to re-register as the party that I want, or whatever party in my candidates in order to vote for them. And so then I started to look into RFK Jr. because he wasn't just running as an independent. He's running for the Wee the People Party. Because apparently it's easier to run or start a new party because you only need 75 thousand people to register for that party, as opposed to running as an independent, which is around 210,000 I believe. But yes, so when you register, you get to pick your party, and you would have to put in other as your option and fill it in with Wee the People. So I'll be sharing that right here.

@afeefnessouli_video_7312611484784282910.txt," A new poll by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research was just conducted. It includes Palestinian sentiment in the West Bank, Easter, Russelam, and Gaza. Note that this only includes Palestinians in Palestine, not the diaspora. The poll was taken between November 22nd and December 2nd. The sample size of this poll is 1,231 adults, of whom 750 were interviewed face to face in the West Bank and 481 in the Gaza Strip and 121 randomly selected locations. Because of the war in the Gaza Strip, they conducted interviews in the central and southern regions inside the selected sample homes with the exception of one displaced area. As for the northern Gaza Strip, residents were interviewed in 24 shelter locations. A total of 250 interviews were conducted in these shelters. Another 21 were conducted in the homes of relatives and friends of displaced people from the north. First, the majority of respondents, 81% believe Hamas's attack on October 7th, was a response to long-standing Israeli attacks on Palestinians and their holy places, and that it was aimed at releasing prisoners. The majority of respondents, 72%, also believe that the decision to launch the attack on October 7th was the right one despite the costs that have followed. Note that in the West Bank is that 82% and in Gaza it's only 57%. Hamas's popularity has also gone up significantly, and that's usually typical during Israeli aggression in Gaza. Respondents say they're more satisfied with the role of the Hamas movement than any other Palestinian actor. Mahmoud Abbas only pulled at 11%. Support for Hamas has more than tripled in the West Bank, compared to three months ago, and in Gaza, support for Hamas increased but not significantly. Despite the increase in its popularity, the majority in both the West Bank and Gaza do not support Hamas. It is worth noting that support for Hamas usually arises temporarily during or immediately after a war, and then returns to the previous level several months after the end of the war. Support for President Mahmoud Abbas dropped significantly. The same is true for trust in the PA as a whole, as demand for its dissolution rises to nearly 60%, the highest percentage ever recorded in PSR polls. Demand for Abbas' resignation is rising to around 90%, and even higher in the West Bank. Despite the decline in support for Fetah and Abbas, the most popular Palestinian figure remains Medwan Behrouti, Fetah leader. But Houti is still able to beat Hamas's candidate, Ismail Hanee or any other. 88% of respondents want Mahmoud Abbas to resign. Reminder that this is the man Biden wants to put in charge of Gaza. And if elections were held today, 51% of respondents say they would vote for the Hamas slate, while 19% say they'd vote for Fetah. 65% of respondents believe the two-state solution is no longer viable, and 69% support a return to armed confrontations. This is up 11% from September. The number of respondents supporting armed struggle in the West Bank alone is at 68%. This number has doubled over the last two years. Support for the armed struggle rises 10% as points compared to three months ago. When it comes to the role of regional actors, Yemen is the most popular with 80% support. Saudi Arabia is the least with 5%. As far as international actors go, respondents are not very satisfied by any of them. Position of Russia at 22%, China 20%, no surprises about the US, which is at 1%. The findings also indicate that the majority believes that Israel will not succeed in eradicating Hamas. Or in causing a second Palestinian Nakhba, in expelling the residents of the Gaza Strip. A large majority believes that Hamas will actually emerge victorious from this war. A majority also says that Hamas will resume control over the Gaza Strip when it's over. The bottom line seems to be that Israel's war of mass destruction hasn't resulted in making Palestinians any less likely to support Hamas. Or to use arms. It resulted in fact in the exact opposite. It's also really important to note that Palestinians don't want to be led by the leadership that Washington wants to engineer. Palestinians have agency, and they're the ones who need to choose what comes next.",subjective

@johnou81_video_7349722809645665582.txt," I'm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and I'm running as an independent candidate for President of the United States. I grew up in an America that seemed to have achieved its promise as an exemplary nation. Modern democracy is spread from one nation of ours in 1776 to 6 by 1865 and 290 by the 1960s. We had become the city on the hill. We were on oral authority around the globe. Our government, institutions, our Congress, the court, the regulatory agencies and even the American press were renowned for their integrity and they were revered worldwide. Other nations wanted our American leadership. They knew the difference between leadership and bullying, which is something our current leaders seem to have forgotten. We were the template of liberty, proof that for a country to thrive, its people must be free. Free to speak, free to worship, free to build great companies, free to start small businesses. We were the freeest country in the world and by no coincidence, also the most prosperous. Where Americans could provide for their families on a single salary, they could buy a home, raise a family, save for retirement without mountains of debt. We made the best music, we made the best movies, we made gold standard automobiles and everybody in the world wanted. We made blue jeans, we reconstructed Europe, we put men on the moon. We the world's healthiest, best educated children, our productivity, ingenuity, our can-do spirit, we're the envy of the world. We had confidence in our strength, our capacity, and the limitless potential of our country. Yeah, we had serious racial and environmental problems, but in the head days of my youth, the environmental movement and the civil rights movement were picking up steam. My father and some of his allies were fighting to eliminate the last pockets of hunger and Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta and on the Indian reservations. And we became for the first time a true constitutional democracy in this country with all races voting and holding political office. Other countries aspired to be like us and our children grew up proud of their passport, proud of their flag. My uncle, President Kennedy, left us a legacy of peace and the hope of ending the arms race and winding down the Cold War. Those were the traditions of freedom, prosperity, and peace that my father, my uncle and Martin Luther King, Jr. were striving to protect in advance. In the half-century since their deaths, we've lost touch with that vision for our country. I want to tell you right now that we can still restore that America. The America that all this was, and yet, may be, but we have to start by being honest with ourselves. Neither my uncle nor my father would recognize the version of America that we have today. We become a nation of chronic illness, of violence, of wholenliness, depression, and division, and poverty. Our great cities are becoming tendon campments. Modern day Hooverville is filled with undocumented immigrants and dispossessed Americans that people living in their cars laid by mental illness and addiction and despair. Our border has come under the control of criminal drug cartels that traffic and desolation and fentanyl, and in buzz loads of desperate human beings, our children are drowning in a crisis of alienation, dispossession, and complete disconnection from their communities. We've lost far more of our young people to drugs in the last decade than in the 20-year of Vietnam war. We've printed nine centuries worth of money in a little over a decade and spent eight trillion dollars on regime change wars. Those wars have made America less safe, our country less strong, and the world far less able, while sending prices through the roof as our infrastructure falls apart, tens of millions of young Americans no longer even dream of owning their own home. What happened to America in the land of opportunity where you could be sure that if you worked hard and played by the rules, you would have a decent life. All the new wealth of the last generation has gone to the billionaires and to transnational corporations while our tattered middle class, our infrastructure industry, have been hollowed out from the inside. Instead of promise, we've left our kids sick and drowning in debt. The public debt has gone from about five trillion dollars under President George W. Bush to 34 trillion dollars today, and US household debt is at a record I have 17.3 trillion dollars. If you include discouraged workers, our true unemployment rate is 23%. Young parents face housing, grocery, and childcare costs that are unaffordable. Do many Americans are living bleak and hopeless lives dreading the one medical emergency or the car repair that will tip them over the edge into homelessness. We rank 40 as globally in our people's health and wellness out of the richest countries in the world. The United States is 35th in child poverty rates just about Mexico. We rank 36 in literacy and 45th in press freedom. We've won the highest cancer rates in the world and our life expectancy now ranks 59th according to the world bank. That's right behind Algeria, which spends less than one-thirtyth per capita of what we spend. But even these grim figures hide the full picture of our dire health crisis. We now have the worst health outcomes in the rich world. The highest maternal mortality rates, the highest number of gun deaths per capita, and the highest number of teen pregnancies. We lead the world in obesity and chronic disease, according to CDC 60% of Americans have at least one chronic condition. When my uncle's president, only 6% of Americans had chronic disease, and all of these plights fall heaviest on our young people or in 10 of them suffered depression, and a half of them have considered suicide. One in 10 has anxiety, one in 10 has ADHD, one in five is obese. It's time for us to say enough is enough. We were once a free and thriving nation, healthiest and strongest in the world. What we once were, we can be again. How do I know that is because everywhere I go in this country, I see a profound determination among Americans, the heal. We might have become the sickest country on earth, but we also have the most ingenious healers, both inside and outside conventional medicine. We may have sky high levels of depression and addiction, but we also have innovators who have opened up new frontiers and recovery. We have some of the world's most depleted agricultural soils, but also some of the world's most innovative and energetic regenerative farmers. We have serious economic problems, but we also have the brightest and most ambitious entrepreneurs. We face hunger and homelessness, and yet we meet it with highest philanthropic rates in the world and bottomless kindness and compassion. We may be on the map today, but we can be on our feet and happy and healthy and strong again with good leadership tomorrow. Our people and our system were built for resilience, and here's the most important thing I want to tell you about the state of our union. Our nation seems more divided than ever, but Americans everywhere I want to heal that divide. Our nation has become artificially divided by political forces that can survive only when we the people are at war with each other. People are tired of being manipulated by fear. We learn that lesson during COVID, we recognize that the same techniques of manipulating fear are being used by elites today to corralize into voting for one political candidate or the other. Americans are tired of these dire warnings that to preserve democracy itself you better vote for our guy. I can tell you that in every state of this union people are rejecting fear mongering. 80% of Americans say they don't want to be forced to choose in this election between a lesser of two evils. They're tired of voting against something or someone. I see it in the crowds and mix Republicans and Democrats and Independents, who attend my rallies that are growing number of Americans are rejecting defeciveness. They're ready to unite to rebuild this country and to fulfill the promise of the America of my youth. They're ready to vote for something and for someone they like, for someone who represents hope and healing, or someone with an inspiring vision for America's future.

Quem tinho como a tega derretida por cima é deliciosa em qualquer momento do dia. Começo hidratando o cus, a quantidade dos ingredientes eu deixo aqui na descrição do vídeo. Em uma vasilha coloque os flocos de milho, eu uso orgânicos, sal e temperos a gosto, aqui eu estou acrescentando plantíze da pura vida. É um case de vegano em flocos que deixa um sabor muito especial. Agora vou colocar a água aos poucos mexendo bem até todos os flocos ficarem úmidos. Deixe descansar por 10, 15 minutos e mexa bem. Agora uma xícara grande, essa minha tem torno de 300 ml, eu vou montar bem com manteiga aqui, que é uma manteiga clarificada e sem lactose da pura vida, que vai já deixar um sabor ainda mais especial nesse cusco. Coloque toda a massa sem apertar pros grãos e nos ficarem bem soltinhos. Coloque um pire sobre essa xícara e leve ao microondas por 2 minutos. Se você não quiser usar microondas ou não tiver em casa, você também pode fazer na air frai, uma média de 4 a 5 minutos. Desinforme quentinho e finalize com um pouquinho de manteiga. Fica simplesmente deliciosa.",subjective

@nubianbynature_video_7343774523730267435.txt, Good evening everybody and welcome back to Truth Be Told. I'm your host Ty. Let's get back into this. Now when we left off I was talking to you about how many people actually voted knowing that this guy has nothing left upstairs that he pretty much I don't know what drugs they might have this guy on and that's my opinion. What kind of drugs they have this guy on to keep him walking around but Joe Biden is basically a corpse with a fucking that's a good sign it's name that's it that's the only purpose that thing has okay no other fucking purpose but he knows what he is the people that are around him know what he is his the sad fucking thing the people that pulled those levers for this guy knowing what he is seeing what he is him proving to you what he is how bad he's fucked you in ways you can't imagine that army haven't even come out yet you don't know what the fuck this guy's been doing behind the scenes that'll come out two years after this fucker has been in the ground so how do you mend fences with neighbors like that what do you do and oh by the way let me not forget that no matter what town that people voted in for Joe Biden 6 to 67% of the black people in that town voted for Joe Biden and that's after the if you don't know whether a vote for me or Trump you ain't black that's after the I love little roaches rubbing their hairs up and down my legs little roaches used to be what they call small black children back in the 40s 50s and 60s probably longer before that but that's when I picked it up okay so when he's talking about roaches remember he was a lifeguard at an all black swimming pool okay so he wasn't talking about in a little white kids rubbing up his legs and shit all right so it's not about race but 67% of whatever the black population was who went to vote in whatever city that had his name on the ballot 67% of people that look like me the people he's been fucking since he got into office still right fucking behind him how do I you know pass that off and say okay let's fucking be chums again my peoples yeah right so when I go off like that folks there's reason for it you would think that just out of just plain we need to preserve our country forget about how you feel forget about how to fuck I feel if we don't come together we're gonna lose it all okay and even with that these motherfuckers will still jump into that same bullshit these are the people who have 10 to 12 million fucking illegals illegal invaders in our country okay these are the people who did it and each and every one of you guys who pulled a lever for them back in fucking 2020 a fucking responsible for and the people who just pulled the lever form in the West's name are even fucking worse because it's like you know you got a pedophile and you still let them watch your fucking kids amazing to me so do me a favor folks I know a lot of the people that watch me a Christian Christians who actually give me a lot of leeway because with my you know choice of words sometimes it could be kind of tough for a Christian to sit back and listen to but for the ones who dig stick with me hey thank you very much for the ones who didn't I understand but nah that's not gonna be any more togetherness there and the people who are in my family or friends or whatever who happen to think that way and still wanted to declare themselves Democrats well not with me in your life okay just fucking forget about me I don't wish you any harm but you don't got to go home but you can't fucking be around me because I just won't have anymore I won't have people who are doing things detrimental to my fucking well-being telling me that they want to fucking be my friend okay just won't have it anymore I'm not sure we're gonna be able to avoid that major conflict because there's gonna be conflict folks okay now I'm getting off on their tangent here again but these are things that need to be said that most people don't want to say because they're afraid to there is going to be a conflict in this country it's already been set up as one now there's one of two that I'm thinking of okay either the people like me just get absolutely fucking fed up bullshit like if they try to fuck Trump or whatever the case may be keep him out of office okay chances are folks like me are not gonna just fucking stand still for it all right and we're not talking about marching around with no fucking signs either so there's that but the guaranteed conflict that's something that could happen that might not ever happen the first one I just told you the second one is gonna fucking happen okay because what you've done if you've invited every person who's an enemy of this country who wants to see this fucking country fail you've allowed them to dump their garbage here okay and their garbage is fucking contagious hundreds of thousands of military age men okay came and settled in here took over the neighborhoods of some of the oh by the way that reminds me where the fucker the crypts in the bloods where's the Latin Kings where's all the rest of these guys where's all the real guys that I knew were fucking just animals out in the street okay if they chose to be that that would never let this shit go where the fuckers are mafia at where's our boys where's our pizons at why are we loudness to happen these are the same people that will be out there shooting each other down if somebody with a fucking red hat came into a blue hat neighborhood they will be shot a hundred fucking times and so with anybody else who was around him because it can't shoot worth a shit but now all of a sudden you got real invaders the real deal people who are fucking their country is so sick of them they fucking send them out of the country they just if even if they were murderers rapists or whatever they say you know what just to be really your ass we're letting you out long as you go to America that's fucking amazing I don't think we've ever had anybody in prison here that we said you know what we just don't want to deal with anymore here we're gonna let you out but you just can't never come back to this country again now there's some hardcore motherfuckers you're getting ready to meet up with that is gonna happen there's nothing that can fucking stop that because when you say even when Trump gets in office when he says time to fucking go home you're gonna get resistance and he is what I'm saying he is that whole fucking setup was for this point our men better find their halos and they better find them quick or it's gonna be more of your mothers more of your daughters more of your nieces your nephews your sisters more of your family members are gonna fall victim in prey and it vertically or it vertically if something's not done I've already begun okay begun what not in your fucking business let's just say I've already begun some things don't need explaining but I'm not putting up with any more shit from any fucking body okay if I'm not gonna go out and look for it but I'm not gonna have it coming into my fucking purview and not saying anything or do something about it that keep your mouth shut shit is done with over with so there we have that but be prepared folks because a conflict is a common when you got people who are used to getting free shit then all of a sudden you turn off that fucking spigot leave you me you know there's a reason why they say at Yellowstone do not feed the bears and it's not because they don't want to see the fucking bears eat bears are built knowing how to get something to eat but in a lot of cases if a bear gets fed human food once they'll never hunt again they'll always seek out the easier meal seek out humans and when the bear doesn't get the food that he thinks he should get he gets pretty fucking in bigning about it and that's the way people like the ones we have here now are gonna get so you better be prepared for it and you better be prepared to go all the fucking way okay and I'm not just talking about the guys my age and shit I'm talking about these young little fucking whippersnappers the ones who think they're truly tough let's see how fucking tough you are you better get ready to man the fuck up because we're gonna need to okay there's only so many cops there's only so many fucking military and

@verifythis_video_7298463436348935467.txt," Did you know that undocumented immigrants can vote in some elections? Using these sources, I'll walk you through which elections they're allowed to vote in, and which ones they're not. Federal law prohibits undocumented immigrants from voting in federal elections. And currently, no states grant undocumented immigrants the right to vote in state elections. But undocumented immigrants are allowed to vote in more than a dozen local municipalities across the nation, including Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Oakland, and 10 municipalities in Maryland. Some of these municipalities, such as San Francisco and Oakland, only allow their undocumented residents to vote in local school board elections, and that's only if they have a child attending that local school district. Others, such as Washington, D.C., allow them to vote on offices, such as mayor and council member, as well as on referendum. Something to note, though, many non-citizen voting laws, including those that affect undocumented immigrants, have faced legal challenges upon their passage. The California Court of Appeals sided with San Francisco in a legal challenge to stop its non-citizen voting law in August of 2023, and Washington, D.C.'s law is currently facing a challenge in court.",subjective
@lthlnkso_video_7354099223144533290.txt," With 63 million views, this tweet says the number of voters registering without a photo ID is skyrocketing in three key swing states, Arizona, Texas, and Pennsylvania. Their data comes from the Social Security Administration's Help America Vote Verification page. Page says only in situations where no driver's license exists. Should the states verify the last four digits of the new voter registrants' Social Security number? In other words, this is a system to help states register people to vote who don't have a driver's license. Those people instead use their full name and the last four digits of their Social Security number. That is the number of times the state's request of verification is reported on this website back to 2011. Using Census data, we can find the population of each state for each year. And then we can create a plot which is the total number of verifications each week per 10,000 population of the state. And now we can just scroll through the 50 states and look for anything that stands out. I think Arizona stands out. They've had a recent increase in verification per 10,000 population. Missouri stands out. And Slovenia and Texas. So what does this tell us? Is the original tweet right? Well, not exactly, but for reasons that I can't quite explain. Let me explain. Social Security page is showing us number of verification requests. It's not really showing us number of new voter registrations. Even though the page says that it should only be used when registering a new voter. For example, the state of Texas reports three times a year the number of registered voters in the state. And from that, we can plot the number of new registrations per year. It averages about 400,000 against the number of verification requests. And you can see that there are many more verification requests for Texas than there are new voters. This isn't perfect because we're only looking at the number of net new registrations per year. So the number of registered voters this year minus the number of registered voters last year. And you might imagine that millions of people could move out of Texas in a year and millions more move in. So there could be a lot more verifications if all the new people moving in got verified to vote. Texas Secretary of State makes a similar observation. It is totally inaccurate that 1.2 million voters have registered to vote in Texas without a photo ID this year. The truth is our voter rolls have increased by 57,711 voters since the beginning of 24. But note that this doesn't account for the net new problem I just mentioned. The Secretary of State also says the Social Security administration number is clearly incorrect and we are now working to determine why there is such a large discrepancy. So it seems like the Texas Secretary of State thinks the Social Security numbers do not reflect new voter registrations. Another reason to doubt this comes from October 31st, 2022. If you look up that week on the HAVV data viewer, you can see that the state of Arkansas has 1.6 million total transactions. So unless you think that half the state of Arkansas registered without a photo ID in a single week in the year 22, then you have to think that there's something else going on with the Social Security numbers. Maybe these numbers aren't accurate. Maybe there's mistakes in the numbers or maybe the states are using them for things they aren't supposed to. So if this HAVV system just lets the state verify whether people's full name and last four of their social match, maybe the states are using it for things other than voter registration and that's distorting the numbers. I really don't have a great explanation of what's going on. I've seen a couple news articles about this. One in Rolling Stone references this statement from the Texas Secretary of State that I showed you, along with a similar statement from an official in Arizona, but neither of those statements address the net new voter problem and neither of those statements explain why the social security numbers are as unusual as they are. So if you have a better explanation or a theory, I'd love to hear thanks for your time.",subjective

We need like representation across the board, ages, races, everything, except for they admit that they don't actually listen to everything. They actively admit that they're a bad voter because they didn't do their due diligence and listened to everything. And they're also voting for Abba. They say that the album is not Abba's best, but it's pretty good. So pretty good constitutes a vote for record and the album of the year. They also admit that they're holding Harry Styles's origin story against him because he came from a boy band. Like, you can't even make this stuff up. This one is not as bad as the previous one, but it's an artist, a female songwriter who says that she didn't vote for Adele or Beyonce because they already have enough Grammys. They're also going to vote for Harry Styles as it was because it's similar to the kind of music they would want to put out. Like, what is going on?

And even more specifically, this is relevant for the person that's working on the campaign of someone that's run for office previously. And that particular person had purchased a web domain. Whether they ran for office one and kept it or they ran for office lost and kept it, same bit. What I keep seeing is that the internal part of the website has been updated. Like, if you're on the website, it says what they're now currently running for. But where it's not updated or has been like a missed is how it shows up on Google. So for example, say someone ran for state senator. They won, but now they're running for Congress. The internal part of the website when you click onto it, it's totally updated. They're now running for Congress all the details. If you go to Google, it says like Joe Schmo for state senate. So it's really confusing. It's like, hey, what are they running for? But two, someone might not go to that website. They're like, oh, that's the world website. So this is just my little heads up for a lot of campaigns out there because so many people that have won seats before now run for other offices, yada yada yada, make sure that the website is updated and properly showing what the person is running for on Google search results.

In those screenshots, I saw an amount for $2.5 million. $2.5 million is not showing up on the Federal Elections, the Federal Elections Commission's website, the FEC. So, what's that $2.5 million for?

First primaries start in January, so this is something you need to do right now if you want to be able to vote. You can go to vote.gov that's going to help you register to vote, check your registration, make sure everything is on the up and up. Now depending on your state, you're either going to have an open primary or a closed primary. An open primary states just being registered to vote allows you to walk in and vote for whoever you want to. Whereas in closed primary states, you're only allowed to vote for the candidate that corresponds to your voter registration. So people registered to vote Republican can only vote for the Republican candidates. People registered to be Democrats can only vote for the Democratic candidates and people registered as independent. Oftentimes cannot vote in a closed primary. Now that brings up the topic of which should you pick that should you vote in the Republican primary and try to knock Trump out of the way or should you vote in the Democratic party. But then you'd have to register as a Democrat. Do you really want to do that? Yes. Registering with a party does not mean that you have to vote for that party when the big election comes. So go to vote.gov or any other state site that helps you check your voter registration. I don't care which one you use. Register to vote so that you can vote in the primaries. A lot of the way that the big election will go will be based on the polling that we get from primary data.

That's right, not only is it Super Tuesday morning, it is always thankful Tuesday. And we have much to be thankful for just because he woke us up. That's enough to thank him all day long. Just because he allowed us to not only wake up but get up. And then when we got up, we stood up. And then when we were able to stand up, we were able to walk. I mean, for those of us that don't take his many blessings for granted, that in and of itself is enough to be thankful for. But our morning meditation comes from Isaiah 43 and 18, where it says, remember ye not the former things. Neither consider the things of old. The hold I will do a new thing. Now it shall spring forth. Shall ye not know it. I will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert. And so what I want you to know this morning is not only is it Super Tuesday morning, not only is it thankful Tuesday, but it is a new thing Tuesday. And I want my Super Cruda always known as good as God has been. He's better than that. That's right. I mean, I know he's done some amazing things in our past. But I want them to know that the best he has has not been seen yet. Did you hear what I said? I said, his best has not been seen yet. And I know there is some of you this morning that are appreciative. You're grateful. You're thankful. And you want God to know that you know what God? I know who you are. I know what you've done. And I'm thankful for that. But then I know some of you are like me right now that says you know what God? All the things that you've done in my past, I'm thankful for that. But I'm thankful right now for what you're doing in our lives. That's right. God, when we pray that you make us an example of your goodness and your grace, then God, you are allowing people to see that it is not us, but it is you that is in us. That's right. It's not about us, but it is all about you. Everything we have, we owe to you. Everything you gave us belongs to you. And everything we'll have will come from you. That's right. So God, we want to thank you for everything you're doing right now. But then what we want to also do, God, is we want to thank you for the new things. I mean, God, we know that you've been better than good in the past. We know that you're better than good right now. But God, we believe that you're biggest and you're bigger and your best is in our future. That's right. So I want the supercrued to always know that you know what? As good as you've seen in the past, I want you to focus on your future. That's right. Don't worry about what is behind you, but stay focused on what's in front of you. Stay focused on your future. And in Isaiah 43, the Lord comforts His people who have been afflicted and under Babylon rule. And so what He wanted them to know is you know what? I delivered you from here. I brought you out of this. I'm going to bring you out of this. But where I'm carrying you to is better than everything that is behind you. And I want some of you to receive that word right now. I know you're having a hard time letting go, walking away, and letting some things in your past, being your past. But I want you to know that what is in front of you is better than everything that is behind you. Do you realize that when God allows some things or some people or some stuff to be done away with, to walk away, to walk out? Do you realize that God has better in front of you than everything that is behind you? And I like another translation of this verse where it says, but forget all that. That's right. Forget all that. Forget all that that has happened. Forget all that that didn't go right. Forget all that that went wrong. Forget all that that didn't work out the way you want it to. Forget all that that didn't look like you wanted to look. Forget all that that didn't act like you wanted it to act. Forget all that that had deceived you. Forget all that that had betrayed you. Forget all that that had left you back, left you down, let you down. Forget all that. It is nothing compared to what I'm going to do for I am about to do something new. New, that's right, something new, something you had never seen before, something you've never experienced before. See, I have already begun. Do you see it? I will make pathways through wilderness. That's right. There's some lanes that you hadn't even thought about that you're going to walk in. You're going to lead in. You're going to step in and you're going to develop. Not only that, but I will create rivers and dry wasteland. That's right. Wences where water shouldn't be, God is going to make sure that it's your wealthy place. That's right. When people go to places that they have never been blessed, He's going to make sure that you are in your wealthy place when you get to places that you've never been before. You're going to go to some places that people didn't expect to see you and that's going to be your place of prosperity. That's going to be your place of blessings. That's going to be your place of riches. That's going to be your place of abundance. That's right. God has a way of blessing you in the midst of a famine. He has a way of blessing you in the midst of a drought. He has the way of blessing you in the middle of a desert. He will create rivers that will flow on your behalf. It's super Tuesday. It's thankful Tuesday. It's a new thing Tuesday. And I promise you what God is going to do. It's going to be better than everything He's done before. It's super Tuesday. We're the super crew.

@vox_video_7280238580746800426.txt," This is Miami-Dade County, the biggest county in Florida and one of the most left-leaning. In 2016, it voted for Hillary Clinton by about 30 percentage points. In 2018, the Democratic candidate for governor won up by about 20 points. Then, in 2020, Joe Biden only won the county by about seven points, and in 2022, the Republican candidate for governor won in Miami-Dade County. This is a pretty big shift. But if you look at who lives in Miami-Dade, there's a clip. Nationally, Latino voters have mostly voted for Democrats in recent elections. And they also used to in Florida, which is about a quarter Latino, but not anymore. In 2022, the state's Latino voters went firmly for Republicans. Latinos in Florida are voting more Republican than before, and voting more Republican than Latinos elsewhere in the US. These are the seven states with the largest Latino populations in the US. Together, they make up two-thirds of the country's Latino population, and here is how those populations break down in terms of what the US census calls specific origin. You can see two trends here. In the southwest and midwest, Latino populations are mostly Mexican. In the Northeast, there are more Puerto Rican and Dominican. But Florida is a whole different story, with not just a large Cuban population, but sizable and growing populations from Venezuela and Colombia. And Republicans have gone after those communities hard, with messaging like this ad from 2022. For this ad from 2020, which linked Joe Biden to the socialist leaders of the country's many Floridians have come from. And you can see what might be the success of that approach if you zoom into Miami-Dade to, for example, the city of Halea, which is about 75% Cuban. They have voted for Democrats at a lower and lower rate since 2016, or the city of Darao, which is majority of Venezuela and Colombia. Same thing. For whom I vote, Republican, of course. Coming from Cuba, we all know what communism, looks like. Dara Trump's the values he stands for for me is the same values I share. Camila, she's horrible. She is socialist. Now, there's also been speculation that disinformation among Spanish-speaking Floridians played a role in 2020 and 2022, but that is kind of hard to quantify. Anyway, this chart kind of offers a simpler explanation. It shows us Republican spending on Spanish language advertising in the 2022 governor's race compared to how much Democrats it spent. You might interpret this gap as one side was going much harder than the other side. You wouldn't be wrong.",subjective

It's very concerning because younger voters typically have been the core part of the liberal base. This is all according to some new polling from NANO's research. Take a look. The data collected at the end of August shows the liberals in a distant third place for voters in the 18 to 29-year range. They only got 15.9 percent. The conservatives, wow, leading the pack more than double that at 39.21 percent. The NDP in second place with 30.9 percent. Now, this marks a significant dip for the liberals this month. At the start of August, their popularity was at 26.8 and the conservatives were 29.3. Actually, what we're seeing is a focus on economic issues, meat and potato things, inflation, the rising cost of living, jobs in the economy, all those things are on the rise. However, the environment as an issue has been on the rise as many Canadians have been having to deal with extreme weather events and also these wildfires that are across the country. So think of Canadians as cross-precious. But more pocketbook issues being top of mind is for Canadians as they're struggling to pay for the groceries and rent. Well, NANO says there's a couple of things the liberals need to do and fast. Number one, win back supportive women who've shifted to the NDPer conservatives to better mobilize younger voters and also be more competitive among male voters.

@thereturnofyolo17_video_7231292484373073194.txt," The Democrats who have been saying that there are rigged elections, problematic machines, problems with voting systems for a long time now. But who are you going to believe, the mainstream media or your own lion eyes? Let's have a look. Virginia just stopped using touchscreen computer voting because it's so vulnerable. We need to look at all the voting machines. Every Secretary of State needs to be assisted in making sure that they are not being hacked and attacked. I continue to think that our voting machines are too vulnerable. Resources have repeatedly demonstrated that ballot recording machines and other voting systems are susceptible to tempering. So you don't like the voting machines? What about the dominion ones? Even hackers with limited prior knowledge, tools and resources are able to breach voting machines in a matter of minutes. So you see, in microcosm, democracy means we get a mandate for what we want to do anyway. In the event we lose, we complain about the system. The Republicans do it and plainly, as you just saw, the Democrats do it. In 2018, electronic voting machines in Georgia and Texas deleted votes for certain candidates or switched votes from one candidate to another. The biggest seller of voting machines is doing something that violates cybersecurity 101, directing that you install remote access software, which would make a machine like that, you know, a magnet for fraudsters and hackers. These voting machines can be hacked quite easily. So the legitimacy of elections and the results of elections is something that's been queried for a long time. There are voices of the Democrat party in various settings making the exact same claim. You could easily hack into them. It makes it seem like all these states are doing different things, but in fact, three companies are controlling this. It is the individual voting machines that some pose, that pose some of the greatest risk. There are a lot of states that are dealing with antiquated machines, right, which are vulnerable to being hacked. So basically, they just say stuff unless they win. Unless they win. They say the problem is the machine. You don't see any more politicians going, listen, we love fair and square, but ultimately we all love America and we want American people to succeed. The workers were able to easily hack into an electronic voting machine. It was possible to switch votes. 43% of American voters use voting machines that researchers have found have serious security flaws, including backdoors. Backdoors. I think the Dominion needs to look in a run light and he hates voting machines. Backdoors, they've got bad breath and stinkin' little dicks. We know how vulnerable now our systems were. We know I know that hackathon that took place last year, where virtually every machine was broken into fairly quickly. Oh my God, all of them, they're all broken. None of them work. At the minion watching this. I actually held a demonstration for my colleagues here at the Capitol, where we brought in folks who before our eyes hacked election machines. These are the same people that after Trump made the claims that the election was regrined. That's impossible. How dare you say that? You, sir, are a disgrace to democracy and you keep causing insurrection and your hairs ridiculous and your orange and that's all that really is the disgust. This one's gonna show you there are no ultimate values or principles. There's just rhetoric attached to achieving the outcomes that they would prefer to achieve that are themselves tethered to financial interests that they're personally affected by. Look at all the nepotism, look at all the stock ownership and look at the way they legislate on the bar of big business. I am very concerned that you could have a hack that finally went through. You have 21 states that were hacked into. They didn't find out about it for a year. It is worth fighting for integrity in our election system, which means that they are free from interference by a hostile or an unfriendly nation. Like Russia, for example, no evidence of that at all, absolutely no evidence, completely cooked up media concoction in conjunction with the Democrat Party. There's a saying that I'm sure many of you have heard, which is the, you know, the difference between being hacked and not being hacked. Mm-hmm, go on. Is knowing you've been hacked. Yeah, you know, okay, don't do that joke again. Hillary, how do you feel about voting machines? Do you have a principled perspective on them that will not change depending on whether you win or lose an election? The opinion will stay the same, right? There are some tech experts in Silicon Valley, with whom I have met, who say that, you know, maybe what they'll do this next time is to really disrupt the actual election. Shut down the servers that you send results to. Interfear with the operation of voting machines because still too many of them are linked to the internet. So there, we are still very vulnerable. Don't they just accept that some people vote for Donald Trump because they're disillusioned with the political class? Why don't we all accept more broadly that the problem is deeply systemic and is the result of the ability of powerful deep state and corporate interest to manipulate the congressional and democratic process to the point where democracy is sort of a facade. Okay, so after the 2016 election, the Democrats said there's a problem with voting machines. But after the 2020 election, there's no problem with voting machines. What an amazing miracle! After a public and victory is in 2000, 2004 and 2016, Democrats in Congress used the formal count in a electoral vote as an opportunity to challenge election results. Derek Muller, a law professor at the University of Iowa, wrote in a New York Times opinion piece in 2021. In January 2001, Representative Maxine Waters joined several other Democrats challenging George W. Bush's victory claiming Florida's electoral votes were fraudulent. In January 2005, after Bush's reelection, Senator Barbara Boxer formally challenged Ohio's electoral vote, even though Bush won Ohio by more than 118,000 votes. Wait, that's recount that because what they've done is that 180,000 votes could have been done by a little cyber lego hacker that gets in the machine. Did you see the lego movie? They're bastards. In January 2017, after Trump's victory, Representative Sheila Jackson lead said there was the malfunction of 87 vote machines and Representative Jim McGuvern, Democrat Massachusetts said there were confirmed an illegal activity is engaged by the government of Russia in the 2016 election. Then as now, each member of Congress was within their rights to make an objection, Mula Roe. But the objections were naive, at best, shameless at worst. Either way, the readiness of members of Congress to disenfranchise millions of Americans was disconcerting. And now there's Stacey Abrams, the Democrat who ran for governor of Georgia who claims that Brian Kemp, the Republican who beat a four years ago, won under the rules of the game at the time, but the game was rigged against the voters of Georgia. Fraudulent electoral votes, malfunctioning voter machines, rigged elections, sound familiar? Well, yeah, it does actually, it sounds like exactly what's being claimed right now. How is it different? If the election results go their way, these are some of the best electoral machines we've ever had. How dare you criticize those persistent, minion-voting machines been like a brother to you! How dare you criticize it? You lost the election. You got us out of our bitch! You little Russian racist sound of a fuck! I sit on the Senate Intelligence Committee and Senate Homeland Security Committee, and we receive all kinds of information about the vulnerabilities to our national security. We are vulnerable in terms of foreign interference with our elections. Did you see that? On the road to the White House 2020? So when they're on the white to the White House? Oh my god, we could lose. The voting machines, if we do lose, they are terrible voting machines. They could be hacked by, you know, a Russian with no one in their boots, with cancer, like Putin best at some of the bitches. You won the election. Those are some of the best voting machines.

@campaignlegal_video_7298377906919705887.txt," It's time to take a hard line on soft money. Federal campaign finance laws help ensure that voters know who's spending money to influence their vote and prevent wealthy special interests from drowning out the voices of everyday Americans. Soft money is money that doesn't comply with these laws, but is nevertheless used to influence federal elections. It's illegal for federal candidates to use soft money to seek federal office, but some are doing it anyway. That's a big problem that empowers wealthy special interests and undermines voters right to know who is spending money on elections. And it's already influencing the 2024 race for the White House. One way candidates are using soft money is by illegally transferring money from state level packs that they control, which are not subject to federal campaign finance laws, to federal super PACs supporting their presidential campaigns. For instance, Ron DeSantis illegally transferred $82.5 million from his state pack, friends of Ron DeSantis, to the super PAC never back down, which has effectively served as his shadow campaign. By openly flouting the laws, banning soft money, DeSantis has allowed the corporations and wealthy special interests that wrote large checks to his state pack, money that they can't give to DeSantis's campaign to secretly fund his presidential aspirations. DeSantis isn't the only candidate who is pulling tricks like this to get around the law. Unfortunately, the Federal Election Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing federal campaign finance laws, has consistently failed to do its job and hold violators accountable. That needs to change. At the 2024 election heats up, it is vital that the FEC enforce the laws necessary to crack down on soft money violations to maintain transparency and accountability in our elections.",subjective

Trump is hosting a fundraiser in Florida on April 6th to attract big donors. According to the Associated Press, the invitation says that their nations will first go to Trump's campaign, then to save America back, and then finally the R&C and state political parties. Because Donald Trump is going to be the nominee, it gives him access to larger donations. Unlike candidates who can only receive up to $3,300 in donations, this arrangement allows for a single donor to donate up to $800,000 and a couple to donate up to $1.6 million. When those checks are written, Trump's campaign and save America get paid first before the R&C ever sees a dime. So typically a national party committee looks out for down-belly candidates around the country and provides them with assistance like research, polling, financial support to help their campaign.

@myundocumentedass_video_7343234752100453674.txt, So yesterday was super Tuesday where 16 states and the American Samoa held their primaries to decide who's going to be the Democratic nominee and who's going to be the Republican nominee come the general election in November. And it looks like this November we're going to have the rematch nobody wants between Biden and Trump. Starting with Trump he won pretty much every single primary last night except Vermont. Nikki Haley won Vermont and she also won Washington DC a few days ago but it doesn't matter she is so far behind that there's talk that she's finally going to drop out of the race. So now Trump is only 220 delegates away from officially locking in the Republican nomination. Biden also did well last night winning almost every single primary that was held. The only place Joe Biden lost last night was in the American Samoa to some guy named Jason Palmer. Honestly this guy I've never heard of he's never visited the American Samoa. He mostly did his town hall meetings through Zoom and he barely had any money for this race. I don't know what the American Samoa knows that we don't because they've done this kind of things before like in 2020 they were the only place that voted for Michael Bloomberg. Yeah remember that. So congrats to Jason Palmer for being the winner of last night. You did better than Marianne Williams and Dean Phillips. So nice job. So yep this is where we headed. Biden versus Trump again in November. The thing nobody wants but we're going there anyways.,subjective

@shipwreck_show4_video_7358603433148058926.txt," March 31st in 2024 is widely known as Easter Sunday this year. But what you might not know is that the White House today yesterday, the 29th, whatever day that was came out and they made a declaration claimed that March 31st, 2024, not only to be Easter Sunday in 2024, but it's also going to be a transgender day of visibility. The White House calls upon all Americans to join us in lifting up the lives and voices of transgender people throughout our nation to work towards eliminating violence and discrimination based on gender identity. For the annual Easter egg rule that the White House does every single year, for this year, it's usually theme based. But this year there are certain things that are going to be banned from being allowed to be colored on the eggs. Eggs are colored by the children of the National Guard. And this year it's going to be all about education and things in the kids' personal lives. So there are going to be banned from being able to be drawn on these eggs are things that are hate-filled, bigoted, and there was like something else. So not going to be allowed to draw anything on your egg that is religious theme. No crosses, no pictures of Jesus, no pictures of the Bible, etc. So I'm not big into religion. I grew up Catholic. I have an understanding of the Easter holiday. We celebrated it immensely when I was a child going to church and doing all of that. You know, my children understand the story of Easter and they understand the Bible and they understand. So we don't celebrate it the way that we did when I was a kid. How the fuck ever I understand that Easter holds a very special place to many, many, many, many people in the Christian faith. Even though I'm not super religious anymore, I still hold Easter to be a day of the Lord, a day of Jesus Christ, the day that He has risen. So to come out and to announce that it's going to be national transgender awareness day on the same day that is Easter Sunday seems blasphemous, maybe? Also the whole point of Easter is not necessarily the egg hunt, but the religious background that goes with it. So to ban religious drawings on the eggs, I mean, this feels intentionally ragebait. It feels like an act to get the Christians riled up to hate on the transgenders because of this. That's how this feels. Feels intentional. There's a theory out there right now that they're trying to remove God and Christianity from the public ideology. And you can go back and forth. There's lots of different ideas. I feel like this is more of a spiritual thing for like the possession of your soul. That's my thought on a white house does something like this. That's something so blatantly blasphemous, so intentionally divisive. It does lend a little credibility to that theory. Fucked up, man. That was a fucked up move.",subjective

But there is a movement growing that realizes we are in a democracy, we need a democratic constitution, we need a democratic republic. There's a historical tradition of that going back to some of our founders. Writers like Eric Foner, Daniel Azare, they've written about this. Jonathan Israel's, regardless. With a democratic republic, with universal and equal suffrage in a U.K. rule body, with absolute power in the hands of the people to representatives, the people would have the power to create publicly financed elections. We would be in an environment in which things are public. We aren't for censorship. We have a government that is ideologically opposed towards open, and open conversation with them, with the political class, about changing the system, about this, about how the entire structure is antiquated and it's democratic and inefficient. We have people like me, we have us, people who have huge voices, media voices. They may eventually, everyone will talk about it. Many can saw it as mentioned that our government is a minority-ruled institution, right? The Senate is a minority rule. The presidency is a minority rule. The Supreme Court has the power of a judicial review that gives the minority rule power over the majority. But if we actually have an equal vote in a constitution, that's the representative system. When we go to an election, those that come to power, again, public financing of elections is popular. Getting rid of corruption is popular. So if you have the power of that vote, you are on a level playing field. Yes, there will always be private money at first before you achieve those concrete bills, those concrete reforms. But you will at least start from a standpoint in which the entire structural framework of representative government is not aimed against us, and therefore working in the favor of that corruption, the favor of that private money.",subjective

The Matt and DA is not said anything about it, but he's calling for people to protest. Is that irresponsible? Well, first of all, let me say I'm taking it back at the idea of inditing a former president of the United States. At a time when there's a crime wave in New York City, the fact that the Manhattan DA thinks that inditing president Trump is his top priority, I think, is just tells you everything you need to know about the radical left in this country. It's the last five years, the Democrats have been dismantling tough criminal justice in the city of New York, families are paying the price, and yet this is what we get.

And new filings with the Federal Election Commission reveal that the RNC raised $87.2 million in 2023, but spent $93.5 million and ended the year with just $8 million on hand. The RNC also currently has over $1.8 million in debt. Here is the official filing in the FEC. You can look a little bit more in-depth there. But these numbers are also consistent with what state Republicans are experiencing as well. For example, in Minnesota, the Republican Party is just under $150,000 in cash on hand, but over $400,000 in debt owed. And meanwhile, the Democrats can't say the same thing.

Grew up in a conservative Christian household in Iowa, so I'm very, very well around conservative politics all the time and my parents have absolutely influenced not only my morals but my political beliefs through that manner. And I think a lot of those teachings actually led me to being more progressive and more liberal over time rather than actually being conservative. For me it's kind of similar. My dad is Christian but in Vietnam they have this thing where actually they practice both Buddhism and Christianity. From both religions, both Buddhism and Christianity, it's always taught about we as a community need to take care of each other, need to respect each other and we need to create the best society we can. My parents not directly tell me, oh you should believe this or you should believe that, but just the way that they have taught morals to me and also their own personal experiences have influenced my own beliefs. In Buddhism, it's basically what can you do that is the best for others. Of course not everyone agrees with my beliefs but regardless of that I still want them to have happiness in life. I'd say my parents gave me probably one of the most interesting childhoods out there. I was observant so I watched my community. And when I saw how things had progressed in my community and then just stopped, especially during the housing recession and crash in 2007 and 2008, I had a deep question as to why aren't things getting better. They didn't teach me anything. They let me learn my own way because if they had taught me something I wouldn't have had the thirst to know more. I stepped forward because I believe without them I could have had some other sort of beliefs but I felt that what they taught me pushed me down my path. So I became a conservative in 2018 and I became that based off my research. I was actually a liberal before that just because everyone else around me was a liberal. I would vote for Trump in the upcoming election over Biden or anyone else that runs against him. He embraces free market economics just like I do. We need less government spending. We need to cut taxes. We need to cut government spending and Donald Trump will definitely do that. Are your parents conservative? They are actually but politics never came up in my family before Trump became president. So they did not influence me to be a conservative. But there were two years between Trump being inaugurated in 2017 and then if it was late or mid 2018 a year and a half of Trump being in office running headlines a lot of big things happening. Are you sure none of that? And they're commentary at the dinner table maybe didn't. No I remember 2016 election. They didn't say a thing about who they wanted. That's hard. I know I'm telling you. It just didn't come up. And obviously this country is way more political now than it was 10 years ago. But I'm telling you I just became a conservative based off my own research. Our whole entire family is very much on the left like democratic liberal but my mom she was not and she would claim that she was a Republican but I don't think she knows the damn thing about what that means. But like she is. That's fine. But there was a lot of tension a lot whenever we would talk about certain political things that I would bring up and then my brother he's very right leaning.

George Washington actually who is the last independent to occupy the level of it, complained it is farewell speech that the two party system would encourage a kind of partisanship that would have those parties be controlled by outside the interest and put a political ambition ahead of patriotism to our country.

This page names every single representative and their stance on the Israel and Palestine war. And again, I want to stress that this is as of today, 1114 things could change even over the last couple days as I was creating these lists. Things changed, new press releases came out, the stance has changed. So I will try my best to keep this updated for you guys. Now mind you, the information here on this page is specifically from their website, whether they are for a ceasefire, whether they are not for a ceasefire, whether they are for a humanitarian pause, whether they have no stance at all and they didn't make a statement at all, all of this information is here. And I do just want to note that out of 52 representatives, only four. Four representatives have called for a ceasefire, only four. So we're starting off small here. I know that this is not another measure or initiative that I've looked into. This is just for your information. So you know exactly who your representative is.

@bloxcast__video_7298168522432253230.txt," So when conducting political polls, they are done on a local state and federal level. The most accurate of the three, in my opinion, are the state ones. With the New York Times just released a poll and they are very accurate with their polls, and it does not look good for the Biden administration. Of six swing states, Nevada, Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, Trump wins pretty comfortably in five of them. Which would end up looking something like this. And remember, these polls don't include the third party candidates, Cornel West, and Robert Kennedy Jr., who we have shown before, causes more damage to Biden than Trump. Now for me, the two surprising ones were Michigan and Georgia. I think Michigan and Georgia are both going to go blue, but Wisconsin is going to go red. Which would make things a lot closer. They also found in the poll that just 37% of people say they trusted Biden with the economy, compared to 59% with Trump. Only 2% said that the economy was excellent during Biden's tenure. Voters also preferred Trump over Biden on immigration, national security, and the current Israel-Palestinian situation. Biden's most dominant issues were climate change, health care, democracy, social security, and Medicare. So while I don't think it's going to be as bad as this poll suggests, I still think it's going to be pretty bad for the Biden administration.",subjective
@momenz4_video_7358822547065933099.txt," As most everybody knows, Iran recently launched several hundred drones and missiles at Israel. Fortunately, there were no fatalities. This attack was Iran's response to an Israeli-Eshdraik on their consulate in the maskeh Syria on April 1st an attack which killed seven Iranian officials. I applaud President Biden for doing what he can to make sure that this conflict does not get out of hand, does not escalate and does not create what would be a disastrous regional war. But while we pay attention to this developing Israeli-Iran crisis, I hope very much that we will not lose sight of the unprecedented humanitarian disaster now taking place in Gaza. We must not lose sight of that disaster. As I'm sure all Americans know the war in Gaza began on October 7th when Hamas, a terrorist organization invaded Israel, killed up to 1,200 innocent men, women and children and took over 230 people into captivity, many of whom are still being held. It has always been my view that Israel had a right to defend itself, respond to this attack and to go after Hamas. It is also my view that Israel does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people which is exactly what the Netanyahu government is doing. President let us take a deep breath and understand that what is happening right now in Gaza is horrendous. It is inhumane and it is in gross violation of American and international law. It is driven by extreme right-wing Israeli government officials and a government which is increasingly dominated by religious fundamentalists. That is who is driving this humanitarian disaster in Gaza. And Mr. President, what should be most troubling to the American people is that we as Americans are complicit because it is US taxpayer dollars that have helped create this unprecedented humanitarian disaster. Mr. President, let me briefly describe what is going on in Gaza because it is so easy in a world full of problems, media focuses on this, focus on that, Congress focuses on this and that. It is so easy to turn away from the tragedy in Gaza, but we must not do that. Mr. President, there are about 2.2 million people living in Gaza, 2.2 million, mostly poor and struggling people before the war, before the war. Gaza was a very poor and desperate area. Let us not forget that important fact that before the war some 70 percent of the young people in Gaza were unemployed. Since this war began, over 33,000 Palestinians have been killed and 77,000 wounded. Unbelievably, 5 percent of the residents of Gaza have been either killed or wounded in a 6th month period, 5 percent of their entire population, 2 thirds of those who have been killed or wounded are women and children. Mr. President, since the war began, 1.7 million people over 75 percent of the population of Gaza have been driven from their homes. Let me repeat it, 3 quarters of the population have been driven out of their homes. These people, poor, many of them are children, do not know whether they will ever return, pushed out, not knowing where they are going to go, where they are going to sleep, 3 quarters of the people of Gaza. Over 60 percent of the housing units in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed. This housing destruction is unprecedented in the modern history of the world. 60 percent of the housing units have damaged or destroyed, but it is not just housing. Israel has systematically destroyed the health care system in Gaza. Gaza had 36 hospitals before the war. Now, just 11 are partially operational despite the tens of thousands of injuries and hundreds of thousands of ill people. Persistent attacks on health care facilities have killed more than 400 workers. I have spoken with several American doctors who have returned from missions to Gaza. They tell of operating for hours on ends in crowded hospitals with little electricity or clean water or medical supplies. They have had to perform surgeries, including on children with no anesthesia. They have tried to sterilize and reuse medical gauze. Thousands of women have had to give birth in these inhumane and dangerous conditions and health care workers report a major increase in miscarriages. It is a health care nightmare. But it is not just housing and the health care system that is being destroyed by the Netanyahu government. It is the physical civilian infrastructure in Gaza as well. Mr. President, more than half of the water and sanitation systems have been put out of commission. Only one or three water pipelines is operating. Clean drinking water is severely limited. And sewage. Raw sewage is running through the streets of Gaza spreading disease. Mr. President, as we speak tonight, there is virtually no electricity in Gaza. But it is not just housing and health care and infrastructure that are being destroyed. Mr. President, there are 12 universities in Gaza, 12 universities. Unbelievably, each and every one of them has been either damaged or destroyed universities. In addition, primary and secondary schools have also been completely disrupted. Over 600,000 children have no access to education. And Mr. President is horrible as all of this is. There is something happening now that is even worse. And that is what these photographs speak to. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian children face starvation. The people of Gaza struggle are struggling to survive from day to day, faraging for leaves, eating animal feed, or splitting the occasional aid packages amongst their family. In the North, the situation is far more desperate. At least 28 children have died of malnutrition and hydration already. 28 children, but the real toll is likely much, much higher. Without food and clean water, with sanitation systems destroyed, and with little health care available, hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza are at severe risk of dehydration, infection, and easily preventable diseases. So let me repeat once again. As we speak, hundreds of thousands of children are at risk of terrible deaths.",subjective

I do believe that Zionism is the best option for Jewish people trying to escape the very serious amounts of violence they've been facing in places like Russia and Eastern Europe for the past century. So can I count on your support here? So if I'm here and you're correct, you want me to support the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine. Well, that's a little tricky. But ultimately, I think it's a good idea. I just have one quick question. Will the Jewish people here in America want to relocate to this new Jewish National Home in Palestine? Like, will all the Jews here leave here and go there? Well, I don't think all of them want to relocate, but I imagine many Jewish Americans will. Great. That's all I wanted to hear because you know I'm a Southern Democrat, I'm a good old boy, and I'm all about keeping it wasp. You know what I'm saying? White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant.

You think I can swing that? They already have that. It's called Liberia, but most black Americans didn't want to go there. I know right. I want a dream. Anyway, it can't be for the rest of the US, but you got my support. Look, we all know what the situation is in the Middle East, and it's a goddamn cluster fuck. Apparently, we got Britain and France supporting Israel's invasion of Egypt. Wait a minute. Why is Israel invading Egypt again? Oh, apparently Egypt nationalized a Suez Canal and won't let the Israelis use it. I think the best course of action for the US would be to back Egypt and get Israel, to back the fuck off. Wait a minute. Why would we do that? Won't we the first country to even recognize the state of Israel? Look, of course we still support Israel and it's right to exist. But this is a very delicate situation. There are a lot of interests here. We have the balances. It's very complicated. What's so complicated about it? We support Israel, right? Oh my God. Do I have to fucking spell this out for you? Oh, I, ale, bitch. We need oil, okay? We are at peak industrialization in America right now. And Egypt got that oil on lock. There's also a bunch of other Arab countries in that region that have oil. And we want to be on their good side too. We also don't want those countries to fall to communism and that's the most important thing right now. So we're going to support Israel. But in this particular instance, we're going to support Egypt. There's going to be a lot of that from now on. Supporting both sides, depending on how it suits our needs. So we're basically going to be some fence-round motherfuckers, okay? I can dig it. I don't want to wait to look at it. But look, we're still going to give money to Israel. You know, we're going to give them money for food and stuff like that, humanitarian aid. And I imagine by the early 1960s, we will eventually start selling them some weapons, but we're also going to keep selling weapons to Egypt and Jordan. But what I mean, Israel is that wall with Egypt and Jordan hates Israel. Why would we sell weapons to all three of them? I mean, what's the objective there? What do you think the objective is there? I see profiting from all sides of the conflict in that region for decades to come. Yeah, that's that military industrial complex you've been warning everybody about.

@usatoday_video_7356365199370095914.txt," If voting gets harder in itself, things that 2020 election, dozens of southern states have tightened the voting regulations on when and how people can vote. Our USA Today reporter, Aramance Field, has more. We're looking at some things like who can turn an absentee ballot, they call it ballot harvesting. We're looking at voter ID. We're looking at how voter roles are being cleaned or being proposed to be cleaned. We're also having to talk about a ballot harvesting in products, how does it work? So a ballot harvesting at its core, let's say you want to help someone else vote and you go. And so maybe you get some absentee ballots, you bring them around to people, you help them fill them out, and then you bring them back to the registrar's office. That in its essence is what ballot harvesting is. But then at its worst, advocates for this bill would say, well, we don't want people to be paid to go out and help people fill out their ballots because we don't want them to influence their vote. In March, Republican governor, KIV, in Alabama signed a bill that would make it illegal for anyone other than close family members or cohabitants to help request, fill out or return an absentee ballot. Alabama is one of the only four states that don't allow in-person early voting. And then I showed absentee ballots were more often used in the state's Black majority counties. How would you say this pictures might really affect the outcome of the general election in November? We have a couple of states that are going to have really close races. North Carolina and Georgia are two very big ones. You never know how close it's going to be. It could come down to a single state with, you know, dozens or so electoral votes. In 2013, the US Supreme Court struck down the requirements for certain jurisdictions to seek better recolourance for any new voting law changes. Now, the burden mostly falls on the civil rights groups in each state, as the federal law suits to block the measures they've deemed to these franchise voters.",subjective

I'll be giving basic instructions, but you can also find four flavor variations on my website that will work with both the small Moroccan style couscous as well as the large pearl Israeli couscous. For either variety, you'll need a saucepan with a fitted lid. The smaller Moroccan style of couscous is ready in about five minutes. You want to bring two and a half cups of liquid to a boil along with half a teaspoon of salt and one tablespoon of olive oil or butter. Bring this to a boil and then once boiling, add in two cups of couscous, pop the lid on, turn off the heat, and let stand for five minutes before removing the lid and sloughing with a fork. For the Israeli Pearl style of couscous, you'll want to increase the amount of liquid to three cups. In this case, I'm using chicken broth in place of the water, which is always an option. You can also use butter in place of the olive oil, which I'm going to do with this one. Once again, season with salt. You can also add in other herbs and spices. And then once boiling, you'll pour in two cups of your Israeli style pearl couscous. This type of couscous needs to simmer uncovered over medium low heat for about 10 minutes before popping the lid on and letting it sit for five minutes. Sometimes I even like to stir in some freshly grated Parmesan cheese for a Parmesan couscous. The different flavor possibilities are really endless.

Governor Romney says he's against same-sex marriage because every child deserves a mother and a father. I think every child deserves a family as loving and committed as mine. Because the sense of family comes from the commitment we make to each other to work through the hard time. So we can enjoy the good ones. It comes from the love that binds us. That's what makes a family. Mr. Romney, my family is just as real as yours.",subjective

In the states of note, our Arizona, they would need to flip both chambers by gaining two seats in each. Michigan's pretty close. They would only need to use their newly one control to pass it. Nevada's one senate seat away. New Hampshire could be flipped allowing them to join. Pennsylvania could flip their senate by gaining three seats. In Virginia, would have to flip the house by gaining three seats and winning their governor's office in 2025. And last but not least is Wisconsin.

The nonpartisan races have nonpartisan, they have Democrats, they have Republicans, so it's important to look up the candidates on your ballot and make sure that you are voting for Democrats. There are a lot of anti-choice extremists that are on the ballot this year and it's important to make sure that you are not voting for them. If you need help finding the Democrats on your ballot, you can put on our website at www.blessedemocrats.org. Lancaster County Democrats has a voter grant and so does Serbian County Democrats. Otherwise, all the Democrats that are running are on our website at www.blessedemocrats.org and you can find it right at the top of the page. It's very easy. Make sure I don't let people on your ballot because there are Democrats and there are Republicans and if you're looking to not vote for any Republicans, then you have got to look them up. So thank you so much for being a voter and again, election day is May 4th, so find your polling location and everything that you need to vote at www.nabraskedemocrats.org. Thanks so much.",subjective

@knowledgeequalspower__video_7219069670748474629.txt," You keep defining abortion as the murder of babies, which biological fact is you would say most abortions are done before they are actually babies. It's still just a fetus. So my question is- Do you know what the word fetus means? It's just a cluster. It's like, that's not a fetus. That's not a fetus. It's a baby eventually. The word fetus, it's a Latin word, and it just means offspring. That's all it means. It just means the next generation of a being. But that's what a baby is also. I mean, that's what your adult, you would call your adult child someday once he's grown, hopefully if he hasn't been here. Can I ask my question? Well, I'd just like to clarify this point. You would call your adult child your offspring too, but all of these terms that you might use, fetus, embryo, the one they love is zygote, which sounds like a Pokemon, but they use all these different terms. But it's all referring to the same being, and you were that being once. You, the person who's standing here right now. Do any of us have a memory of being that being? Oh, I mean, I don't have a memory of last Thursday, frankly. It's been a very busy week, but the lack of a memory doesn't mean it's all right to murder me. Well, anyways, my question is, you stress murdering babies a lot, but when it comes to murdering babies, kids, and everything in everyday shootings that keep happening, you say nothing. So I ask, why is it okay to murder babies when it's regulating women, but not regulating guns? No, I say quite a lot about that, actually. I think the crime is a terrible problem, and I think it's just awful that liberals have funded, and it intentionally installed liberal DAs who won't prosecute violent criminals. This has led to an increase in violent crime, and it's awful. I totally oppose that, but it's not me, and it's not my side that's funding that sort of thing. Now, you say, why wouldn't I want to regulate guns? Guns are very regulated in the United States as it is, and I've yet to hear one gun control proposal that would stop any of these shooting incidents that people talk about. People focus on the sensationalized ones from the news, a school shooting, or a movie theater shooting. No proposed gun control legislation of the last 30 years would have stopped any of those. And the majority of the shootings are gang-related in their handgun shootings, and so I'm all for cracking down those gangs and throwing them all in the can, but it's usually the liberals telling me that we have to abolish the police and go soft on crime, and they were just failed by society, and so we can't put them in prison, and we have to abolish the prisons, too. That's not me, I'm all for it. You want to get me a bill, and you want to elect me to office, and get a bill in front of me that will crack down on gang crime, and these gangsters using handguns to kill kids. Let's do, I'd sign that in two seconds, but it's not up to me, unfortunately. It's up to the side that I suspect you would consider yourself to be on.",subjective
