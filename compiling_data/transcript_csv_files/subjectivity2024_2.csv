I have returned number one talking in the movie theaters or talking during a movie will be a criminal offense and you will be punished to the fullest extent of the law. Unfortunately, listen, this is just kind of intolerable and psychotic and I think people need to realize that there are consequences for their actions even if those actions are just the inability to shut up now listen, not saying a lot coming from me, a person who frequently finds yourself very unable to shut up even I can recognize there's a time and a place for that okay so this is all lesson I do think people need to learn the hard way. Snack companies will no longer be able to produce bags that are 50% air. We've been getting scammed for far too long. This will legally be constituted as fraud and they will be punished as such and this is something that I think is quite frankly long overdue. I will bring back standing six feet apart. We had to do this during COVID as I'm sure you remember. That was my favorite thing about COVID. I don't want anyone near me when I'm in a public space call it a gorephobia. I just call it get away from me and that's a big part of my presidential platform at its core. I will be creating public funded parks designated specifically for Hawker walks. We need a safe space. Hawker walks they help everyone's mental health in some capacity. Mental health obviously a huge part of my platform as well so to have a safe space where you can better your mental health why would why would that not be something I'm funding of course I will.",subjective
@real_talk_with_tom_video_7222668808513703214.txt," I'm Tom Noble. I'm running to defeat Ted Cruz in 2024 for the US Senate seat here in Texas. It's going to be up. I'm running as a surrogate Republican candidate. I'll explain the surrogate in a minute. I'm also running as an independent Republican candidate. Lifelong Republican who was run off from the party a year and a half ago because I disagreed with MAGA because I disagreed with the depravity that had begun to envelop the Republican party. Why? I believe that our government is responsible for a few essential principles. One, most important is to provide safety. Secondly, to ensure justice. Third is to protect and improve the national integrity, our character as a country. And finally, to ensure that we have a compassionate, responsible environment that promotes freedom for all its citizens. So yes, I disagree with Ted Cruz in the direction that the Republican party has taken. So what? It's important. It's important because it's something I believe in that a guy said a long time ago we invented. He said, we, all of us, but especially the young, need around us individuals who possess a certain ability, a largeness of soul, and qualities of human excellence worth imitating and striving for. That is not Ted Cruz. That is not the vast majority of the Republican leadership today. And why is that important? Because our country cannot be something that is leaders or not. Running is a surrogate candidate because of something else that I believe. I'm not afraid of failing. I'm afraid of succeeding at the wrong things. I love what I get to do for a career, for a job. I respect the people that I work with. I believe that the way that I am to make a difference is to try and encourage leadership to stand up and fill the breach that's been caused by the implosion of the Republican party. I said a while back that the Republican party is dead and it is the Republican party that most of us are familiar with. But what needs to replace it is a new independent Republican party. So I'm running as a surrogate candidate. I'm not asking for money. I have no organization. But I will continue to promote and stand up for the principles that a new Republican party can respect. What can you do? Again, I'm not asking for money. If you think that what I'm saying is worth hearing, help me get this out. Let's see if we can make a difference in the quality of the Republican candidate that's presented for the general election in 2024. Let's defeat Ted Cruz and find somebody with moral courage and integrity.",subjective

@crazydebateclips_video_7350759746804239662.txt," I noticed you're wearing an American Lives Matter. Sure. What is your message to this audience right now by wearing that t-shirt? What is your intended message? Well, I think that we should put Americans above foreigners. You know that the whole point of the movement that came with Lives Matter was richly for Black Lives Matter? Yes. I'm intentionally appropriating it. And are you trying to eliminate the movement Black Lives Matter? Are you trying to not bring attention to it? I mean, well, BLM is not exactly a movement that I would be associated with. But I believe all Lives Matter, American Lives Matter. If you're a Black American, Hispanic American, I don't care. So all Americans Lives Matter. Would you take the time to recognize a group of people that who have been marginalized historically and who are now asking for the same rights, the same privileges as white people in the society by wearing, by letting them do white people have that Black stone? So the issue is it's not necessarily written in the law. Oh, so it's like hidden. That's the whole point. That's how marginalized it is. Oh, so it's kind of like a ghost. You see it one day and you don't. Because you as a white privileged person with money have never seen it, doesn't mean it doesn't. What privilege do I as a white person have that a black person doesn't? What can a white person do in America that a black person cannot do? Be specific. Name one thing. So there are so many issues in our society. Name one thing. No, I got a Julian. Name one thing a white person can do that a black person cannot do. So the issue is racism, OK? You can technically do it, but your life may be put at risk. If you are found yourself in certain areas where you might not be accepted by your race, and then your life might be in danger. So OK, what is racism? Can you define to me what racism is? Racism? Well, I don't have the exact description as it is seen in AP style or winky pedia. Can you just talk in the mic please? I'm sorry, yeah. Sorry. Racism is the lack of opportunities because of a race, the kind of like putting a person to a side of a person. So can you name a single example in the last 20 years where blacks were discriminated on moss, where they'd been put aside? Can you give me a specific example? Can you simply talk about police brutality? OK, so over in mass incarceration. What percentage of murders do black Americans commit in America? So there you have a point of there is over policing in black communities. When in a murder? The biggest lower income communities. Blacks commit murders because of police. I'm not talking about murders of police. You're twisting my word. So why do blacks commit so many murders? They don't. So they're 13% of the population, and they do 55% of the murders in America. So there you're not even looking at the background of it. There is over policing in lower income communities. There's under policing in lower income communities. Number two, you're trying to say that over policing, even if that existed, which it doesn't, leads to the fact that 13% of the US population accounts for 55% of the murders. There is a target on people of colored spots, OK? So when a white person sees a person of color? Prove it. There is studies. There is research on it. No, no, give me one example. Give me one piece of evidence that there's a target on black people's back. In fact, I will submit to you. There's the opposite. Black students can get into this college with lower test scores than white students. It's called affirmative action. So now white people are the people who are struggling by the marginalized ones. I will go back to this, though. Can you name a specific example of what a black person cannot do that a white person can do? And be, again, specific of anything. I'm talking about there's so racism as a whole is not written in the law because that's not allowed anymore. But it still exists. Then give me an example. I just told you. You said police brutality is your example. Why do you think blacks encounter police so much? They commit more crimes. There is also a little bit more policing. No, there's also there's under police. And how could you say such a thing? We have defunded the police in Philadelphia, New York, Chicago, and largely defunded it. We saw crime rates go up. I also want you to take in mind that when a whole group is their opportunities to succeed economically, let's say they don't get that higher paying job because they chose a white person instead of a black person, that makes sure that's where that happened recently. That makes an entire community more prone to being lower income. And then that is lower income communities are directly related to more crime activity. But let me ask you a question. What percentage of young blacks have both a mom and a dad raising them? I cannot think of a percentage right now to give you. 25%. So only one out of four blacks in America have a mom and a dad around. Do you think that is a bigger issue to address than racism? Do you think more dads is a better solution or tackling racism, which you say you can't even see in our laws? How could dads be connected directly? Oh, dads are very connected. And what about, OK, when you have a dad around, you're less likely to be violent as a male, less likely to go to prison. So explain to me why all the fathers are leaving. Exactly. Why are they leaving?",subjective
@samuelarmes__video_7349009989001891114.txt," This one guy may have just entirely changed to 2024 election. Let me show you how and break down the strategy. This man is Larry Hogan. He's the former governor of Maryland, and he's just announced that he's going to run for the open Senate seat in Maryland. So why is this a big deal? Well, let me walk you through a few things. Larry Hogan won the gubernatorial election in Maryland with a pretty comfortable margin, and Maryland is a very blue state. And this is interesting because the same year Larry Hogan won, the Democrats took over the House, it was 2018. And the Democrats actually won the Senate seat in Maryland that same year by a huge margin. So what this tells you is that Larry Hogan is very unique in that he's a Republican, but people in Maryland really like him. He's kind of like Charlie Baker, the former governor of Massachusetts, who we discussed in a previous video. So why is this such a big deal? Well, Ben Cardin isn't running, so the Senate seat is open, which means there's no incumbent advantage. Which is why Larry Hogan entering the race he's already leading by double digits. And things are already looking bad for Democrats. They're pretty much going to lose the Senate. It's almost guaranteed that both Ohio and Montana are going to flip from Democratic to Republican Senators. If Maryland flips, it gives them an even more comfortable margin. But look at this recent poll from real clear politics. They take averages from all the individual states, and this is what their most recent polling is showing as far as the Trump Biden presidency goes. You have to remember that presidential elections are key because presidential candidates have trickled down effects for other people running for office. So each state that Trump is projected to win could have trickled down effects for anyone who's running for Senate or for Congress. But let's talk about why Larry Hogan entering the races really crucial and so devastating for Democrats. It's all about money and resources. The DNC only has so much money to allocate to these races as does the RNC. You have to be very careful and very picky. Most of the time the money goes to the people who need it most in states that they're trying to flip. So Pennsylvania, Montana, Ohio, Arizona are all going to be key states for funding for both Republicans and Democrats to either keep or flip the Senate. Now Democrats are going to unfortunately have to start funding Maryland, which was not in their original budget. And this could be a really expensive race, especially with someone who so well likes now running. And every dollar spent in Maryland is a dollar that can't be spent somewhere else. So even if Larry Hogan loses, he could be a resource diversion for the Republican Party. This is the map of the current states that have senators up for election. And as you can see, Republicans are already favored to keep the majority of the Senate if not increase on their margin. Adding Maryland is a kind of in between really screws up the Democratic strategy. And if we compare this map with the previous polling map for the presidency, which has Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania going red, that would put Republicans just four Senate seats away from having a majority to do whatever they wanted in the Senate. That's a pretty big deal. And that's how just one guy can totally shape a 2024 election.",subjective

Appreciate your time. We should also note that we did reach out repeatedly to the Nikki Haley campaign to have a surrogate from her team with us this afternoon, but we were not able to schedule anything despite trying very hard to get someone on. All right, so let's let's talk about Iowa a little bit because obviously the weather could make this a little bit uneventful. It could also make it kind of surprising and Caroline, I want to start with you because there is this expectation that Trump is going to be breaking records out there. He's been far away leading the pack in the polls. However, will he just blame the weather if the turnout ends up hurting his results? That's ridiculous. Look, it is cold in Iowa, but Iowans are tough and there are no more enthusiastic candidates than those four president Trump. We see them line up at his rallies in the wee hours of the morning waiting in the cold. And if you live in Iowa, it is so important that you do get out and caucus on Monday and make your voice heard. Let's turn the page away from these establishment candidates like Nikki Haley and Rhonda Santas. In the past week alone, Nikki Haley said that illegal immigrants are not criminals and Rhonda Santas was lying like a Democrat on CNN about President Trump's record on the border. But more importantly than Nikki Haley and Rhonda Santas is Joe Biden. He can hardly speak. Our Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and he just launched air strikes against the Houthi rebels in the Middle East. Though Biden's weakness is leading us into World War III, we have a wide open border that is being invaded every single day and our economy is increasingly unaffordable for everyday Americans. That's why it's important that Iowans get out on Monday. We are confident that they will. And then he'll come to New Hampshire, which will propel him to the nomination. All right. Well,",subjective
@chuckie00369_video_7235265276764392750.txt, I was looking at Biden's inauguration again and I noticed none of the military had any ranks or honors on their jackets so I decided to go back and look at other past inaugurations and I noticed uh Bush they had their ranks on their jackets.

Think of those pictures we also have Trump praying and getting arrested as news of his impending indictment's world last March. Another fear is actually not directly related to AI, but to swing voters. Swing voters often help decide how a state goes in the general election, despite being a tiny percentage of the overall electorate. This influence makes that easy targets for AI driven misinformation that can be aimed at their priorities and fears. Scaryer's still, regulators and law enforcement are dangerously behind the times on enforcement and sites like X, Reddit, Latin, and necessary mechanisms to call out deep fake content, especially at scale.

@johnou81_video_7358132719152336170.txt," Manhattan, DA, Alvin Bragg's prosecution of Donald Trump and its trial begins today. What a joke. I'm against these prosecutions on principle. I think they're destructive to our country. But let's just examine the facts and the law here. Alvin Bragg effectively is prosecuting Donald Trump for making hush money payments allegedly to store me Daniels and then paying Michael Cohen in a means that Alvin Bragg thinks his falsifying business records. But first of all, falsifying business records in New York is a misdemeanor not a felony. And it falls outside of the statute of limitations, meaning it happened so far a long ago that Alvin Bragg can't bring the case unless he charges it as a felony, which requires an underlying crime that he's advancing by falsifying those business records that was also a felony. Here's where the legal stretch really begins. That requires Alvin Bragg to say that Donald Trump's payments should have been made out of a campaign account. That's his theory of the case instead of being made personally or else it's a constructive campaign contribution. That's bunk. Think about it. Look at you've had smart people like former FEC commissioner Bradley Smith who has correctly pointed out that if Donald Trump did use campaign money, campaign contributions to pay off hush money, that would arguably be an even stronger legal case to bring against him than the case they're bringing now. So in that version of the world, it's damned if you do, damned if you don't. They're going to get him going or they're going to get him coming. It's almost as though they decided this is the person we're going to prosecute and then we're going to figure out what we're going to charge him with after the fact. Well, guess what? That's exactly what happened. You have Alvin Bragg and Manhattan D.A. who was elected on the promise of going after Donald Trump for what crime we had no idea. Just the idea that they had to go after Donald Trump. This is a politician keeping his campaign promise. That is a bastardization of our legal system. It's not how we do things in the United States. And that motivation accounts for why this case is so weak and emblematic of the other prosecutions that have since followed against Donald Trump. I think Trump is going to prevail, but most importantly, I hope we move beyond this phase of our history, where you have one political party that thinks it can use the legal system to prosecute its opponents. The same shoe can fit the other foot. And if we keep going down this direction, we're not going to have a country left in the complete absence of a legal argument, even, to bring this case against Trump. Is it just embarrassing to Alvin Bragg? It's embarrassing to our country. I hope Donald Trump not only prevails in this trial, but that we prevail as a country to move beyond this phase of our national history. That's what it's going to take to reunite and rebuild this nation.",subjective
@aadampedia_video_7069629677295504683.txt," Why does the US presidency have a term limit? On February 27th, 1951, the 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution came into force. The 22nd Amendment states that no person may be elected president more than twice. Additionally, no person serving more than two years of a previous president's term may be elected president more than once. The 22nd Amendment was a reaction to President Franklin Roosevelt's being elected four times. The 80th Congress, dominated by Republicans, took less than two months to approve the amendment with the help of conservative Democrats. The states took less than four years to ratify it. Interestingly, President Harry Truman would have been eligible to run again in 1952 because the amendment does state that any president who was in office at the time it came into force would not be bound by its provisions. But the two-term precedent came into effect with President George Washington when he refused to be considered for a third term in 1796. Only two men between George Washington and FDR sought to book the tradition. The first was Eulissie's S. Grant who sought a third term nomination from the Republican Party in 1880, but failed to get it. Similarly, in 1912, Teddy Roosevelt sought to rest the nomination for president from his successor Howard Taft. When he failed to do that, he ran as a third-party candidate for president, but lost. Since the 22nd Amendment has come into force, it's only really been relevant twice. The first was with Lyndon Johnson who, having served less than two years of John F. Kennedy's term, would have been eligible for re-election in 1968, Teddy chosen to run.

Carrie Lake lost to Katie Hobbs by 17,000 votes in the election. However, she maintained that it was a sham that the election was rigged and brought a lawsuit. After a two-day trial, a Maricopa County Superior Court judge dismissed her lawsuit. He had already dismissed eight other counts of her lawsuit, but allowed a trial for her to try to prove two additional counts in court. Her claims were dismissed after that trial, and his decision marks the fourth dismissal of a Republican challenge to Arizona election results.",subjective

Okay, so again, that is obviously wrong. If you want to have an intellectual discussion, do you think that maybe comparing her to the grand wizard and the notion of what she said to being a modern leader of the KKK was maybe a step too far? Was Vivit guy? He's Alex Jones 2.0. And what did he say? He said we're at a 1776 moment, we're in the spring of 1776, what comes next July 4th. The war, we're in the war. And he said the damn is breaking. The question is who direction? I concerned Charlie's unless we reconcile ourselves, what the truth of the matter was that led to January 6th. That's really just going to be a friendly preview of what's to come in this country. January 6th was the culmination of what you see when a culture censors people from speaking. When a government repeatedly tells people, and I'm not going to have the administrative state here, not the elected government, tells people to shut up, sit down and do as they are told. You were told that you had to take a vaccine when normally. And by the way, I've been in biotech. You have to take 10 years to get open medicine for the public to believe that it's safe and effective. You can't even choose to take one that hasn't been through that. And yet here, something that went through the process in less than one year, you couldn't choose not to take it on the eve of that election. The most damning story about one of the two candidates, Biden, his son, and being compromised, financially, by our enemies, from Ukraine, from China, in the case of an enemy, to Ukraine, in the case of a corrupt actor, it had to be suppressed. You couldn't even send that on your social media accounts to individual people without being silenced. When he says January 6th happened because of Hunter Biden's laptop, like, are you serious? Why are you saying such silly things, right? So on the other hand, when he says they have massive grievances, and that's why they couldn't take it anymore. And it exploded into this basically, he's not saying it's a riot, but it was definitely a riot and obviously they're broken. That part is correct. Now are there grievances justified? Well, that breaks into two different categories. In my estimation, I think there were some people who thought, no, we're the white right wingers, we always rule. And this isn't, I don't, that's not your America, it's my America. And I'm going to take it back. For them, the idea that someone that isn't on their side, one, is inconceivable. But there's also a giant group of them that have legitimate grievances. Is it like the Republican Trump grievances? No. It's just this system sucks. Crushed our wages is crushed our jobs is crushed our dignity. And it is because of the rampant corruption in government where corporations are just splat out allowed to buy almost every politician there is. Do you get the sense as you travel the country, talk to people, speak that we're on the, it feels like we're on the cusp of chaos? I think we're in the cusp of something. I'd like to think of it as a revolution in a positive sense of that word. I think that, you know, I try to be an optimistic person. Do you feel like this is something going on? I think we're like in a 1775 spring of 1776 moment in this country, actually. I think that people are hungry now. The form I want to see it play out in is reviving those shared ideals that you notice, that set the nation into motion in 1776, that I think are innate to our nature as human beings as Americans. I've seen countless Republicans say 1776 Second Amendment rights, 1776, you have to fight government tyranny 1776 don't tread on me. There's all pushes and pushes and pushes towards violence, but the fact didn't save violence. And because he's smart and he's threatening the needle and if you said to him on CNN or somewhere else, so 1776, are you saying violence? He'll say, I got you. I never said violence. I never said violence. In fact, I said when I was talking to him that it was political and I hope we don't get there, et cetera. But I said 1776, 28 times until Alex Jones's fans thought I meant war and so I get their votes and I get to have plausible deniability. So he does that all the time. And if you notice him like this guy's, he's a careerist, okay? And a lot of, and I can relate, as a young immigrant, you're told get ahead, get ahead, get ahead. And I see it in him so much. So he's copying the style of Obama and the rhetoric and substance of Trump. And you see him in the speech, he almost talks like Obama, but he says Trumpian things. And a press lady, she's in the Congress today, she's a member of the squad. Her words not mine. We don't want any more black faces that don't want to be a black voice. We don't want any more brown faces that don't want to be a brown voice. Literally word for word. I'm not putting any words in anybody's mouth. Ibrahim Kendi wrote the book How to Be an Anti-Rasis. I wrote Woking. It was a pretty successful book. His sold more copies than mine. Here's what it says. Opening lines. The remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination. So the other side of gas like you when you say this stuff is like, oh, you're just making that critical race theory stuff up. No, these aren't my words. These are the words of the modern grand wizards of the modern KKK. These Republican politicians actually ruin it for conservatives because they're trying to do something different than what your priorities are. Your priorities are to live in normal life and get along, etc., right? But his priorities to get attention. So he puts a KKK line in there and then that destroys this point because you can actually have a real debate in which we're going to. We're going to have this conversation about Diana Presley and Kendi and see if that makes sense. But he doesn't want you to have that real debate. He just wants to get famous. And so I mean saying that they're the modern KKK, really, Professor Kendi went and linched someone and burned them alive. Come on, man. Come on, you're disgusting.",subjective

@political_chicken_video_7281259895817522474.txt," The possible rematch, the 2024 presidential race, is shaping up to be an election for the ages. And age itself is taking center stage. Utah Senator Mitt Romney, who announced this week, he will retire, has urged 80-year-old president Biden to do the same. A CBS News poll finds a majority of voter survey want maximum age limits for elected officials. And many of concerns about politicians' performance past the age of 75. Nicole Killian has more on America's aging leaders. Senator Mitt Romney's decision not to run for re-election in the Senate got some by surprise on Capitol Hill. At the end of a second term, I would be in my mid-80s. And I think it's time for guys like me to get out of the way and have people in the next generation step forward. It's reviving an age-old debate. The president sees not a job for someone that's 80 years old. I'm completely for mental competency tests for anyone over the age of 75. From the campaign trail to Congress. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lomas is one of several lawmakers who supports amending the Constitution to require term limits in the House and Senate where a growing number of members are over the age of 75. I think it's fair for everyone who is in that age group to self-assess in an honest way whether they can go forward with the same vigor. 100% favor of term limits. I'm concerned about the health issues we see in leadership across the federal government. This isn't confined to one branch or one party. Others say it should be up to voters. Every two years in the House, every six years in the Senate, each member is up in front of their own people and those individuals decide whether or not they think they're too old or not. According to a CBS News poll, 77% of American surveyed believe there should be age limits. Over half think the job of president or senator is too demanding for older elected officials. This week in a stinging op-ed, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius said president Biden should not run again in 2024. Writing his age isn't just a Fox News trope. It's been the subject of dinner table conversations across America. Mr. Biden, who is 80, defended criticisms earlier this year. One of the things that people are going to find out is going to see a race and they're going to judge whether or not I have or don't have it. Former president Trump is 77, three years younger than Biden. He's not too old. He's incompetent. And age is interesting because some people are very sharp and some people do lose it. At 83 former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently announced she plans to seek another term. Let's be in the very positive thing about age. It is about judgment.

Stuff I've never heard of, so I didn't watch it. This is Jimmy Lee Tillman II, his entire platform is that he is pro-trum. Like he's part of a group called Black voters for Trump.

Next we have Kathy Salve, she's a former judicial clerk and she also was previously a public defender. Very run of the mill stuff, secure the border, anti-business regulations, don't defund the police, that's basically the gist of her platform. And finally we have Reverend Anthony William.

@markjremillard_video_7298971541578992939.txt," Voters went to the polls in a bunch of states on Tuesday. Here's what you need to know. The big takeaway is abortion is a winning issue for Democrats and has been for the last several election cycles. In Ohio, a ballot measure to amend the state's constitution, guaranteeing abortion access passed handily. Voters really saw through what Republicans were trying to do in this state. A couple months ago, Republicans put up a ballot measure that would have made it harder to pass a constitutional amendment. Voters handily rejected that. They saw that that was an attempt to avoid what we saw here tonight, which was voters pretty overwhelmingly approving this abortion right in the state's constitution. Then in Virginia, not only did Republicans fail to take over the state's Senate, Democrats held onto it and then flipped the House. So now that Democrats have complete control of the state legislature, it is a huge blow to the Republican Party in Virginia, which is the only state that hasn't passed an abortion ban since the Supreme Court overturned Robi Wade. And it's a big blow to the popular Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, who was vowing to pass a 15-week abortion ban.",subjective

@skybailey__video_7270254764129111303.txt," This email made over $20,000 for a client of mine and we're going to unpack it. So for starters, I've been working for this client for only two months when this result came in. Now what we did straight away when I started working with her is we really honed in to what her engaged segment was. And this is really normal practices when it comes to email marketing should only be sending your email campaigns to an engaged segment. Now let's unpack every single metric here. So we had a 46.1% open rate, which is freaking great. But we also have Apple MPP, which is the privacy protection, which Apple actually opened some of these emails. So that's not going to be completely accurate when it comes to open rates. So when I am looking at my metrics, I'm always looking at my click rate first. And this is a 17.2% click rate. Let's all just take a fucking moment because a really base level click rate is 2.5%. 2.5% and this email got 17.2%. So straight away from that, I'm like, okay, this, this email is doing well. It's over performing. So that 46.1% open rate is close to accurate because it's fucking banging. From that 17.2% click rate, we got a 20,343 and 12% from this email. And it's because we really targeted engaged subscribers. The email itself was very, very particular. It had a discount involved in it. And it was involved around a particular day of that industry. So there was a special day in that industry. And it wasn't a Black Friday sale or anything like that. But it really honed into that particular day on a day that our engaged segments would really be looking because they loved the product. They loved the idea of the product. And they were ready to buy on that particular day. From only working with this client for two months, we had a very base level foundational strategy set into place. So we had our campaigns and we also had a few email automation set up. But the real focus here was the engaged subscribers. So when I first got in contact with Hershey, had around 25,000 subscribers. This email was only sent to around 6,000 subscribers. And this is who we deem as engaged. So this is what really did the trick. And then we also got them and triggered them on a specific day that we really knew that would pull their attention.

That's because the U.S. Postal Service has just created a new permanent division that will oversee mail-in ballots for the foreseeable future. Specifically, according to a statement that was put out six days ago, this new division will be called the Election and Government Mail Services Unit and it will officially be in charge of, quote, election mail strike teams and local communities to deal with possible problems. Now, this new initiative is an offshoot of the $5 billion that the Biden administration requested a few months ago in order to support mail-in voting operations over the next 10 years. And as a part of this new plan, the U.S. PS has already sent out almost 40 million mail-in ballots for this year's primary elections. Now, it's unclear why exactly the U.S. PS needs this brand new division, given the fact that according to their official 2020 statistics, they claim to have a ballot delivery rate of 97.9 percent within three days and 99.89 percent within seven days.

A PAC stands for Political Action Committee and it is a way for wealthy people and corporations to donate to their political cause of choice. You have different types of PACs that you can contribute to. You have SSF PACs. Those are connected to a particular organization, corporation, and they draw their campaign donations from other entities. You also have non-connected entities that do not have to have any type of organization associated with them and then they are able to collect funds from the public. But of course what I was talking about was a super PAC is a super PAC is a big political action committee that is able to draw donations not only from individuals, corporations, and things like that but also from other SSF PACs and non-connected PACs. And then you also have hybrid PACs as well. Basically you can just form a committee and do whatever you want and it is not very well regulated. The issue with these political action committees is that it really takes a lot of the power out of the hands of American voters. American votes drive the election but it is really these PACs and their money that drives political campaigns and has the biggest influence over the candidates that even make it into these runnings in the first place. So it is basically like these political action committees have corrupted our election processes and the fact that it results in as having to make a forced choice between the candidates that is just the super rich one.

Donald Trump is really fond of talking about election interference. He's even characterized this case and others against him as their own form of election interference. The irony, of course, is that what this case is fundamentally about is Donald Trump's attempt at interfering with the 2016 election by suppressing what could have been negative information about him in the final days of the campaign. That, according to prosecutors, is why he and Michael Cohen engineered a settlement payment to Stormy Daniels. And more importantly, that is why in 2017, he and Cohen and others falsified business records to make it look like his repayment of Cohen was really just paying him a monthly retainer for legal services.

@lizkuhn__video_7325941296516861230.txt," Usually helping people learn how to vote is so exciting for me. It's like a kink, but West Virginia you kind of gave me the egg. But regardless, here's how you vote in the 2024 West Virginia primaries and if you don't live in West Virginia, comment your state and I will tell you everything you need to know about your primary. First off West Virginia has a semi-closed primary and that's what gave me the egg because it's the most complicated of all the primary types and I just don't think complicated and voting mesh. I feel like they have no chemistry. A semi-closed primary is when state law allows the political parties to determine whether or not unaffiliated voters are allowed to vote in their primaries and that's like kind of all I could find, right? Like I had to do more research in order to learn about this specific election and I don't think most people are going to go into that. But I did find the information and I found out that both the democratic and their republican party are allowing unaffiliated voters to vote within their primaries. That means this is basically an open primary. So that means when you register to vote if you register it as Democrat Republican or independent on voting day you can go in and you can vote in either the Democrat or the Republican primary. No problem. You just can't vote in both which is standard. Now in order to vote in this primary you need to register to vote by April 23rd, 2024. But I say don't wait until then. Do it right now. Do it right after this video if you have to. Do it tonight if you have to. But do it ASAP because like I said in my previous video if you go through all of this information you learn everything about your primary and then you don't get to vote because you forget that would be such a shame. Now ask for a big day voting day that is May 14th, 2024. Put it in your calendar, write it down, take off work if you have to. That is the day that you are going to the ballots and you are voting in your presidential primary. And there you have it. That's how you vote in the West Virginia 2024 primaries.

I'd like to raise a point of order. I'm going to let you say a point of order. One of order pursuant to House Rule 11 clause two, which Mr. Kennedy is violent about. I moved that we were moving to executive session because Mr. Kennedy has repeatedly made despicable anti-Semitic and anti-Asian comments as recently as last week. Rule 11 clause two says whenever it is asserted by a member of the committee that the evidence or testimony of a hearing may tend to defame, degrade or incriminate any person or it is asserted by a witness that the evidence or testimony that the witness would give it a hearing may tend to defame, degrade or incriminate the witness and it goes on. Mr. Kennedy, among many other things, has said, I know a lot now about bio weapons. We put out hundreds of millions of dollars into ethnically targeted microbes. The Chinese have done the same thing. In fact, COVID-19 there is an argument that it is ethnically targeted. COVID-19 attacks certain races disproportionately. The races that are most immune to COVID-19 are- Lady making a motion or speech. I've made a motion to move into executive session because Mr. Kennedy's testimony- Mr. Chairman, I move to table motion. Gentlemen from Kentucky has moved to table. Mr. Chairman, I ask for a roll call vote on the motion to table. Well, let me ask the question. The question is on the motion to table. The gentleman ladies ask for a roll call vote. The clerk will have to step back for a second. The clerk will have to come in. We'll call the roll on the motion to table and then we can get back to testimony. I think the witnesses can sit in the chair sitting behind. I'll leave that up to the clerk's. If the clerks are comfortable with that, yeah, why don't we do that? Maybe we can go right down here. Mr. Chairman, a point of order. Gentlemen from Louisiana. Is it the custom of this committee to censor viewpoints that we disagree with from witnesses? Mr. Chairman, I have a motion to have a motion on the table. There's a motion in the votes. Moving to the second section, we're waiting for Mr. Chairman. We're waiting for the clerks.

@yourpoliticalnews_video_7318231897253874986.txt," The recent developments in Colorado and Maine, where former President Donald Trump has been declared ineligible to run for the presidency, have sparked a significant legal and constitutional debate. In Colorado, the Supreme Court invoked a seldom used clause from the 14th Amendment, originally intended to prevent former Confederates from holding office, to disqualify Trump based on allegations of insurrection. Similarly, in Maine, the Secretary of State made an unprecedented decision to strike a presidential candidate from the ballot under the same provision. These rulings, however, are not final and are pending further legal proceedings. This situation has placed Trump's political future in a precarious position with the U. As, Supreme Court now at the center of this controversy, the main question is whether Trump can still run for president. In light of his alleged involvement in the Jan 6, 2021, capital attack, this hinges on the interpretation of the 14th Amendment Section 3, which disqualifies individuals from holding office, if they have engaged an insurrection or rebellion against the United States, but does not explicitly require a criminal conviction for its application. Dozens of lawsuits have been filed against Trump under this provision, but it wasn't until the Colorado ruling met any gain traction, to decision by Maine's Secretary of State, Shannon Bello's further complicates the matter, as it puts additional pressure on the Supreme Court too. Clarify the applicability of Section 3 in this context, the Colorado case is already on appeal, and while Bello's decision in Maine must first go through lower course, it undoubtedly accelerates the Supreme Court's involvement, to debate around Trump's eligibility raises several key legal arguments. Trump's lawyers argue that Section 3 might not apply to the presidency, claim that disqualifying him is a political issue rather than a judicial one, assert that the process violates Trump's rights, to fair legal proceedings, contend that the events of Jan 6 do not qualify as an insurrection under Section 3, and maintain that Trump was not personally involved in any insurrection. On the other hand, those seeking to disqualify, to Trump argue that the matter is straightforward. Trump incited an insurrection non-Jan 6, thus disqualifying him from running for office. This unfolding legal drama not only impacts Trump's candidacy, but also raises broader questions about the balance of power between voters, courts, and elected officials in determining eligibility for the highest office in the United States. Until the Supreme Court provides clarity, states may adopt varying standards on ballot eligibility, potentially leading to a patchwork of rules and adding, to the legal uncertainty surrounding the upcoming presidential election.",subjective

Especially when you compare it to these multi-billion dollar brands who have probably ten times the budget to work with that she has yet their content doesn't even look half as appealing as Emma's.

@thespectatormagazine_video_7225966475960405275.txt," Let's talk about the politics of Saragat-Sea. Last month, the UK Law Commission published such support into the Saragat-Sea industry. It is recommended to change the parental status of the Saragat baby. Currently, when a Saragat mother gives birth to a baby, she becomes its legal parent, with the intended parents forced to apply through the courts for parental custody. The Law Commission is recommending that this relationship be reversed with the intended parents, recognises the legal parents from birth. But what does this mean for the welfare of an evil baby, as well as the Saragat? Britain's Saragat-Sea industry is currently small, with about 450 cases a year, but it's growing quickly. Some critics of Saragat-Sea have concerns over the power balance between the intended parents and the Saragat. Because the intended parents paid the Saragat expenses, this leaves the door open for them to control many elements of the Saragat's life while she's pregnant. Furthermore, some critics argue that Saragat-Sea breaks apart the very strong bond between a new mother and baby, even, they say, if they are not biologically related. There have been many instances that need to call cases where the Saragat mother has refused to hand over the baby to the intended parents. In some cases, they've won, and in others, they've been forced to hand over the baby. Defenders of Saragat-Sea say that there is nothing wrong with women offering to carry children for those who can't, and that they should be celebrated for their altruism. Others say this reduces the Saragat to being simply a vessel. In light of this, in the Law Commission's report last month, some have questioned whether it is ethical to remove a baby from the Saragat mother immediately after birth. What do you think?

@samsquachfpv0002_video_7358143301427399941.txt," Quite clearly why it should be studied not only in other committees, but particularly here in ethics. This government I have known all along as do Canadians literally for the last eight years. This is the most ethically challenged corrupt government this country has ever seen. And I think what it does, this public inquiry and the evidence that we have heard through this public inquiry and the reports from a number of media giants really underscores and makes it abundantly clear to me as an opposition parliamentarian, but I'm sure to my entire colleagues on the bench as well as across Canada, the rationale as to why the Prime Minister, why the Prime Minister, his government and his back bench fought so hard to avoid this public scrutiny. We always knew that there was a fire to this raging smoke, the smoke screen and it brings it actually brings it really home to me personally given all the work I've done on a number of committees, but particularly in relation to the foreign interference angle as to why he hand picked the special rapator, David Johnson, who had access to the same information that the justice is now receiving, but clearly had a different focus as he was receiving the information and a different focus in terms of his report that in his view, irregularities wasn't sufficient enough to raise the red flags. No mention at all about the leaks. He had access to that information. Canadians were denied the right to know that information. So it brings it all home to me as to why they did everything that they could to avoid public scrutiny. I've had the ability to really assess the cross-examination of our Prime Minister yesterday and contrast that and compare that to his cross-examination if you call it when he testified at the Emergency Act inquiry by Justice Rulow. It was not a good day for the Prime Minister. There were so many significant differences in the evidence that he gave as contrasted to his chief of staff, Katie, when she testified over a year ago. Well, some could say she lied and that certainly an approach you can take. I said that during that. But the most glaring example was that she was adamant a year ago that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reads for rocious amounts of material, voluminous amounts of material. Everything that is put in front of him, he reads. When he follows up and he takes his job as Prime Minister serious, he takes the job of Canada's national security serious. What an absolute joke that is when you hear from the Prime Minister himself yesterday that he's too busy. He's too busy to read confidential briefs from Ceasis that highlight incidents that could compromise our national security that could compromise the fairness of elections, that could compromise the integrity of nominations. He's too busy to read that himself. He wants his yes men and his yes women to do a summary for him. That is a very damning conflicting piece of evidence, Mr. Chair. And now to hear that there was a top liberal staffer who reported directly to the Prime Minister who leaked classified sensitive information, compromising as Mr. Cooper has indicated, compromised the Ceasis investigation. There is clearly an offense for that type of activity. Section four of the Security of Information Act spells it out in plain language that a person who holds that confidential information and shares it with another individual in this case, in this case the member for Don Valley North has committed an offense under that act. Section 27 outlines the punishment for that act. What my colleague Mr. Cooper talked about was the inditable phase of the prosecution of that offense. It's actually a hybrid offense. You can proceed by indictment or summary conviction, but given that the limitation period for prosecuting by summary conviction has long passed, it has to be inditable. This person has a high probability not only of being convicted, but a high probability of spending the next decade in federal prison.",subjective

The regime, the amendment I think was. They call it the first 13th Amendment that some people do. It was also called the Corwin Amendment, named after a member of Congress. And the mainstream historians know about this. Doris Kerns-Glutwin wrote about it in her big book, Team of Rivals. But typically she makes excuses for it. I look at it and said, well, he did more than any other president did at that point to write slavery into the Constitution. And that was an awful thing. Doris Kerns-Glutwin says, no, that was a good thing because it was a slick political move that helped keep the Republican Party together. And that's the theme of her book of what a slick conniver Lincoln was. And he certainly was. I think of him as Bill Clinton times 10,000 in that regard.",subjective

Because once when I was at school, I got given detention for playing f**king before break time had started. I then wanted to give the pardon to the teacher. Who told me off all those years ago. I started by finding the information to every press office for every head of state in the world. I've got 200 countries to slide into the DM zone. I emailed every single country, even North Korea, and after six months, I'd responses from two countries, Gibraltar and Kosovo. After a bit of chatting, Kosovo left me on red, that feeling when you get aired by an entire country. But Gibraltar said that they'd be interested. I think I could be going to Gibraltar. So I flew to the country, which only has a population of 30,000, and immediately ran into the press office I'd been speaking to. He led me up to meet the chief minister, Fabian Picardo, who was more than happy to sign my pardon. I was a signless in the way that I am, properly and hard to do. All that was left to do was head back to the UK and give it to my old teacher. This was a highlight of my life.",subjective

So the way I've had this explained to me, or at least the argument that I've heard, is that Kamala's parents weren't American citizens when she was born here, therefore she's an anchor baby, so she doesn't get to be a full American citizen, which means that she's not entitled to be president, which means she can't be vice president, either. Spoiler alert! That's not how it works! The citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment clearly states all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. Your mother could literally be the queen of England if you're born in America, you're an American citizen.

I know many of you know me as a former member of parliament from the African Christian Democratic Party in the Berlin Guardian the other day they referred to me as a ACDP MP and former Wiesingke preacher and that's correct I'm also a former pastor of Hillsong Church in Cape Town in South Africa actually started the church here in Cape Town along with Phil and Ducinda Dulli and many others trying to know major and the race of them and you know God has done a lot of working my life and I stand here today knowing all of that as a Christian saying I am convinced that this is God's purpose for our life. Be standing here today because I know that I'm a testimony of what God can do and how God can redeem your life despite what goes wrong what you do wrong in your life and I know that God has given me a new identity because I discovered my true identity as a quite some person over the course of my life and as I discovered that I discovered that I am related to kings I'm related to the Indigenous First Nation Aboriginal tribe and many of you did not know this journey of me but I'm related to class profited the chief who was in charge of the Northern Cape back in the 1800s and the town in the Northern Cape called profiler is named after my great great great great grandfather so I also have on my mother's side that's on my father's side on my mother's side I am a look and many of you know I'm a Douglas but my surname Douglas is my adopted parents surname that's why it's a Wesley Douglas but I was adopted that but my biological father was corona profited and my mother was corona look and the two of them had me but I was given up for adoption but I discovered in my journey in discovering my identity I discovered my family again I discovered my the people that loved me again and now I was on this journey to free and emancipate our people from poverty to free and emancipate our people and give out people back the land and back the manual resources so that people can free ourselves from the poverty of rich in snazus we've never escaped apart they've never escaped the the hold that of reconners and other indigenous Europeans had over the land and this is the first time that we have an opportunity as cuddled and as co-eason people to actively participate in making a difference now why am I doing this particular series many people have asked is this just a Jacob Zuma party and answers no we have a broad range of professional people intelligent people people that have been working very hard behind the scenes to make mk work there are people that have been working for years on on economic principles economic plans there's a plan that I have developed for the co-eonsan nation and for the mk nations that that is both upon co-eonsan principles and first nation principles called the Douglas profited plan and I'm about to launch that plan I'm about to show people that there's a way that all of us can live together whether we are indigenous African from North Africa, Bantu or Ungunis speaking tribes or whether you are English indigenous European or you are African or Dutch indigenous European or whether you are from any other Ungunis Bantu tribes whether Zulu's or Tua's or Padi or Situ or whether you are from the many co-eonsan tribes which we have been denied and completely exiled from society outcome tribes our sand tribes our Karana tribes our Frequette tribes our Nama tribes we have so many different Queer tribes and other tribes and we are just not being given the opportunity to be able to show who we are so we've been resisting quietly for years we've been fighting against the system because of the 1994 we found that we will live behind as the colored people and if we will live behind as the colored people our children will be there will be left behind so after I tried my very best to be a good person and and I still am a good person I went through the African Christian Democratic party I said I'm gonna stand for Jesus in politics astute they preaching and teaching and telling people about co-eonsan principles and then the government still being as corrupt as it was back then and after left politics I decided let's go to school me to ministry and I started the heelsongs of Africa started 15 campuses or all in all including with them different ministries and the half that's the heelsong Africa foundation which I started I was back over Pagi and we basically fed thousands of people and we had many projects around the country over the last 20 years and after that I really felt that we we've tried to start the charity route but giving people a hand up and not the hand out is the way I like to do things but the systemic poverty there was no access to the economy for the colored people there was no access to the economy for us to be able to say how do I get a business how do I basically get a procurement from a government department or from a from a from a big corporate we as colored people have been left out in 1994 with a deal was made in in the cadet say in 19 39 94 between the the ANC and the national party and it was Mandelseman dealers ANC that made a decision to say okay we are going to exclude the co-eonsan people from this process that you will be recognized as the banjo and greeting speaking crimes and you will get land but we will keep most of the land as the white people the descendants of the British and the touch we will keep the majority and we will never recognize the co-eonsan people we will pretend that they are extinct and that is how they treated the co-eonsan and the colored people and the co-eonsan the colored people is made up of two groups one is the descendants of the slaves and the one is the regional co-eonsan Aboriginal First Nation people the oldest living nation on the earth we are older as a First Nation than the Aboriginals in in Australia we are older than the First Nations of the region Indians in America and indigenous Indians in Canada there is nobody that is older as by DNA I'm not talking about some made up ideology I'm talking about by DNA we've been proven that the sand and the co-eonsan people are the oldest living race in the world and it we are treated like we do not exist in our own country in our own continent because they are people that thrive on our operation and so we have stood up over the years and I want to show you guys not only out there in the world but also here in NK that we are the true freedom fighters that we are the top of the spear for NK don't treat us anywhere inside or outside of NK as if the colored people are just one of these and jumping on board we have been fighting this battle long and harder than any of you have this is our land this is our minerals and our people are suffering they check us into this townships and into the colored communities and to the Cape Fletts and other auto parks and they just left us there in the manor bugs to die and to kill each other like cockroaches they gave us nothing and they took everything from us and now is our time to fight back as the colored and the co-eonsan people now is the time to stand and there's not another single party that is willing to acknowledge the co-eons first nation status other than Jacob Zuma and the NK and through them we have a chance to take the land back from the white colonists the indigenous Europeans who are refusing to share they are hoarding our stuff they are hoarding for themselves filling themselves what our people suffer what our people are hurt what our people are in pain what our people die what our women cry what our children die what our ten-year-olds are committing suicide in the Cape Fletts because of these white people yeah and I don't hate white people I love them I pray that Jesus would config them of their hoarding spirit and greed that they would come and that they would come talk to us and share but they will not they have not for 50 years they have treated our people are still working on their farms to this day as indentured servants our colored people are still picking their damn fruit no more not anymore from today it changes we are starting the coisan what are you command within

@learnlinden_video_7155475727570390318.txt," This is the number one mistake I see Facebook advertisers make. My name is Lyndon and this is your Facebook ads tip of the day. The four campaign structure, essentially this rule is you do not want more than four campaigns. It will separate all the data, interest, LLA's, retargeting, open. So you then you know where all the data sits. This also makes the algorithm flow a lot better. There's no reason to be running more than four campaigns. It just makes it hard to manage and look over. Four will keep it simple, easy and streamlined the process. Your first campaign should be open. No audience completely open. Also known as the control audience in the beginning. This open audience will be slow and underperform, but over time you will realize it will start to outperform all the other audiences. The reason for that is because over time it was able to learn your audience all on its own. The second campaign you launch during the testing phase will be for interest. Third campaign you launch after interest will be then for targeting the fourth campaign you launch will be your lookalike audience. When you have some solid data coming in the door by simplifying your account structure, you allow Facebook's algorithm learning to auto test which creative and add placements drive the best results so that they can optimize in real time. Benefits of fewer campaigns, improved campaign performance, auto real time optimization, simplified measurement and reporting and a faster opportunity to scale.

As soon as one bullet flies over that southern border towards our people, I would make the declaration that if another bullet flies over that border towards our people, I will consider that as an act of war. And the whole United States military will come down like a ton of bricks on the heads of all of those cartels. And we will flatten them out. We will destroy and kill every single cartel member.

@prominentytshorts_video_7233393753443159301.txt," Hello countrymen. At this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office, there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first. Then a statement somewhat in detail of a cost to be pursued seemed fitting and proper. Now at the expiration of four years during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and ingroses the energies of the nation little that is new could be presented. The progress of our arms upon which all else cheaply depends is as well known to the public as to myself and it is our trust reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the future no prediction in regard to it is ventured. On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, oh what's why anxiously directed to an impending civil war? Oh dreaded it! Oh thought to have overt it while the inaugural address was being delivered from this place devoted all together to saving the union without war insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war seeking to dissolve the union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war came one eighth of the whole population were colored slave not distributed generally over the union but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest all knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war to strengthen, perpetuate and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would render the union even by war while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it neither party expected for the war, the magnitude, all the duration which it has already attained neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph a result of this fundamental and astounding both read the same bible and pray to the same god and each invokes his aid against the other. It may seem strange that any man should dare to ask a just god's assistance in ringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces but let us judge not that we be not judged the prayers of both could not be answered that of neither has been answered fully they all might have his own purposes. Well unto the world because of offenses for it must needs be that offenses come but woe to that man by whom the offense comes if we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which in the providence of god must needs come but which having continued through his appointed time he now will to remove and that he gives both north and south this terrible war as the world do to those by whom the offense came shall we discern and any departure from those divine attributes which believe us in a living god always ascribed to him fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away yet if god wills it he continue until all the wealth piled by the bondments 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn with the last shall be paid by another drawn with the sword as was said three thousand years ago so still it must be said the judgment of the Lord are true and righteous altogether with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation's wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations",subjective

@codypogue_video_7216490086173789486.txt," Running for a political office part 20, campaign strategy. Think about it. If you're running for a political office, let's say you have 200,000 people in your district. The first challenge you're going to have is to get 200,000 people to even know that you exist. Much less convinced them to vote for you just to get them to know you exist. That's going to take a lot of time and money. Now, if you're running against an incumbent who has a lot of money, who's been an office for a long time, they're starting out with a huge advantage. And they don't want to give you free publicity. So their strategy will probably be, if they're smart, to pretend that you don't exist. They're never going to mention you. They're not going to debate you. They're going to walk around and talk about their accomplishments and remind people to go out and vote for them because they don't want to give you any free publicity. Now, your strategy might be to get them to talk about you. One way to do that might be to challenge them to a debate early on. And if they won't debate you, start bringing that to people's attention. So people will go to them and ask, why won't you debate your opponent? Or you could go negative and start talking about their record, talking about where they've fallen short. That might get them to be forced to answer your questions, to answer your criticisms. But there's danger in that. Because if you just talk about bad things all the time, then you kind of become this nuisance. And people are like, this is where people end up saying, I don't like either candidate.

Using these sources, I'll walk you through which elections they're allowed to vote in, and which ones they're not. Federal law prohibits undocumented immigrants from voting in federal elections. And currently, no states grant undocumented immigrants the right to vote in state elections. But undocumented immigrants are allowed to vote in more than a dozen local municipalities across the nation, including Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Oakland, and 10 municipalities in Maryland. Some of these municipalities, such as San Francisco and Oakland, only allow their undocumented residents to vote in local school board elections, and that's only if they have a child attending that local school district. Others, such as Washington, D.C., allow them to vote on offices, such as mayor and council member, as well as on referendum. Something to note, though, many non-citizen voting laws, including those that affect undocumented immigrants, have faced legal challenges upon their passage.

@bookersquared_video_7304399203927674143.txt," I've been tagged in a whole bunch of posted videos talking about the eight circuit decision on section two of the voting rights act. I'm going to do my best to try to explain what happened in plain language. And I'm also going to explain why I think that the eight circuit decision is complete crap and based off of a whole lot of nothing. Okay. So this is about Arkansas State Conference and double ACP versus Arkansas Board of Apportionment. This case was brought by the Arkansas and double ACP in the Arkansas Public Policy panel because they have opposed the new district map that was created by Republicans and the state of Arkansas. They said it caused vote delusion, meaning that they were lumping black voters into super majorities in a handful of districts so that black voters didn't have a chance to really pick as much representation in Congress. Okay. Now historically as individual citizens, including the NAACP private citizens, we are able to sue under section two of the voting rights act based on the discriminatory effect test. What that is is that if you can't prove intentional discrimination because it's a high bar is very hard to prevent intentional discrimination, you can say, well, it doesn't matter if it was intentional or not, the effect was discriminatory anyways. And so either why outcome is the same. Congress amended section two of the voting rights act to add this discriminatory effect test in direct response to a 1980 Supreme Court decision where the court said in city of mobile versus Bolton that unless the discrimination is purposeful, it doesn't count. So the Supreme Court was trying to uphold that very high bar of saying you really got to prove that the race of stuff is racist. Anyways, the whole purpose of the voting rights act is to enforce the 15th amendment. The 15th amendment is in the US Constitution. You all remember the Constitution is here, congressional statute to here. This reign supreme, this cannot contradict this. Okay. Now the 15th amendment says the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on a kind of race color or previous condition of servitude in that section. Two says that Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. Appropriate legislation meaning you do not contradict that constitution. You do not contradict our 15th amendment rights. You are simply putting something in place to enforce it and protect it. Okay. So the Arkansas and WACP brought their case to the district court and the district court said, you know what? We don't think you have a right to sue. You actually don't have the right to sue under the Voting Rights Act in section two. It's only the attorney general who can sue. So, oops, sucks, suck. They didn't even get to the point of deciding whether there was a discriminatory effect. They were just like, yeah, you can't bring this case. So then the NAACP appeal to the 8th Circuit and the 8th Circuit agreed with the district court and said, yeah, only the attorney general can bring this case. They said that section two of the Voting Rights Act does not give individuals a private right to action to sue. They're basically saying that we as citizens don't have any standing to sue if our own 15th amendment rights are violated. That's what they said. That's what they said. Only the attorney general. So the problem with that is the attorney general is appointed by the president. Okay. They run the Department of Justice. If there is say a Republican president in office and they appoint a very conservative Republican attorney general, what interests would they have in bringing a case under the Voting Rights Act to challenge a gerrymandered district that benefits Republicans? Why? You know? So it becomes this whole partisan issue where they're saying that we don't have the right to defend our own rights. Okay. So this decision is binding on the 8th Circuit only right now. That's Arkansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota. But when this goes to the Supreme Court, their decision is going to be binding on all of the United States. So the 8th Circuit goes into this whole explanation of statutory construction. Okay. Statute for construction means this is how we interpret the statute. This is how we see what the statute means. You look at things like plain language, first and foremost. What does it plainly say? You look at things like legislative history, legislative intent because obviously how everything interpret it needs to coincide with what Congress intended when they wrote it, right? So the 8th Circuit came to the conclusion after all of their interpretation that it's unclear where the Section 2 creates a private right of action. Now, the plaintiffs, the NAACP, they correctly pointed out that it says in Section 2, right of any citizen, it doesn't even say attorney general in Section 2, okay? But it does say that states and political subdivisions, they do not have a right to a bridge. The voting rights of any citizen, okay? But the 8th Circuit said, well, no, that's phrases as a restriction on the state. Yeah, I mean, it mentions, it mentions citizens, but it's not really about the citizens. It's about the state not doing something. Then they cite to their own case from 2015, the 8th Circuit's own case from 2015 that says that, well, because this is described as a restriction on the state, it's really unlikely to be privately enforceable. It's very unlikely that there's a private right of action on the right to sue. The case that they're citing to a Spectra Communications Group versus City of Cameron, you'll already know I'm on one and read it. So this case deals with the Telecommunications Act of 1996. I want to point out that the purpose of this act is to benefit American consumers. It's not to benefit telecommunications companies, and it was a telecommunications company that sued here. First strike against them for citing that case, because the voting rights act is very different. We're talking about citizens' doing and the whole purpose of the voting rights act is to benefit citizens. Then they used this quote very disingenuously, I might add, because they only date part of a quote from the case, okay? They said that it was quote phrased as a restriction on state and local government, but the entirety of that sentence reads, phrased as a restriction on state and local government not as a conferral of benefits on telecommunications providers. That is very important and very different than what they implied there in their opinion by quoting just the first half, right? Because they're saying that not only was it a restriction on state and local government, but it didn't give any benefits to telecommunications providers, because again, the purpose is to benefit American consumers. The Voting Rights Act, it's supposed to be giving a benefit or rather defending a right of American citizens, totally, totally different case here. So then the plaintiffs correctly highlighted in the Voting Rights Act where both the Attorney General and an aggrieved person have been able to institute a proceeding to enforce it. This is in section three of the Voting Rights Act, okay? They said, but hey, again, section two doesn't even mention the Attorney General, and if we want to figure out if it's able to bring a suit, look at other parts of the statute. Section three says right here, both the Attorney General and an aggrieved person. But the 8th Circuit comes back and says, mm-hmm, because look at section 12. Section 12 already gives the Attorney General the right to enforce the act, okay? It says the Attorney General may institute a proceeding for the U.S., okay? This is in section 10308D, okay? So they said it would be redundant for them to say Attorney General and section two, again, when they already said it in section 12, like that goes against, you know, our entire role against redundancy, right? That they don't have to say Attorney General. They meant it in section two because of this, but they didn't say aggrieved person in section two. They didn't state that flat out, so it doesn't include them. I went and read section 12 of the Voting Rights Act and wouldn't you know it just a few lines down. This is what it says. District courts have jurisdiction and shall exercise the same without regard to whether a person asserting rights under the provisions of chapters 103 to 107 of this title shall have exhausted any administrative remedies. It says to whether a person asserting rights. That sounds like aggrieved person to me. And if we're going with the eight circuits logic, that tells me that we don't have to restate aggrieved person in section two, just like we don't have to restate Attorney General in section two because it's right there in section two, just like Attorney General is in section 12, right? We have that private right to sue. I don't know. They just kept pulling a bunch of mess. They talked about their case of Roberts versus Wamser, which the plaintiffs brought up. They said, hey, in an eight circuit case, Roberts versus Wamser, you straight up said Attorney General in aggrieved person can bring a case. And then the eight circuit in this case said, oh, we assumed that. When we said that, it didn't really mean there was a private right of action. We assumed. Why are you assuming? Aren't you a federal court, a federal appeals court? Why are you assuming anything? It sounds like bunk to me. It really, really does. So they're out here playing games. They are trying like hell to bend over backwards and find anything they can to completely impede our voting rights and our ability to defend our voting rights, to go in and say in a courtroom and be heard. Just to be heard and say they are violating our voting rights, which we are given under the 15th of the minute. So I don't know how this is going to go, right? This is an issue of standing and we've already seen time and again that the Supreme Court likes to play a lot of games when it comes to standing. We all saw it in through three creative versus the Linus. That case where the woman was thinking about making a wedding website because she might want to do something with weddings and then, ooh, a gay person might ask me to make a website and then if I'm forced to do it, that might violate my first amendment rights and then the Supreme Court said she had standing even though none of that really happened. So I'm not going to be surprised if the Supreme Court upholds a state circuit decision because we already know that they are all about some mess. And the law is complex for reason. It's meant to gatekeep. That's why I try my best to explain this as plainly as I can to the public. But at the end of the day, I can't explain people who are choosing to completely forego logic and just make up stuff as they go. And that is what's happening.",subjective

Objectors will argue that Trump should be removed from the ballot due to his alleged role in inciting the Capitol riot on January 6.

On the other hand, a separate group will argue that Biden should be removed from the ballot for allegedly allowing enemies of the state to enter the U.S. through the southern border. Political analysts Stephen Colliendo dismisses this argument as political retribution and an attempt to confuse the issue. With early voting set to begin on February 8 in many Illinois counties, time is running out to make a decision on the candidates. Adilson points out that reprinting the ballots if a candidate is removed can be costly. It is worth noting that more than a dozen states have also filed challenges to Trump's candidacy, and the outcome of one case could potentially impact all the others. Colliendo highlights that the U.S. Supreme Court will hear the Colorado case, and its decision will likely set a precedent for the other challenges.",subjective

@glendagreer891_video_7321918890412444970.txt," Three years ago today, right in the aftermath of the most secure election in world history, you might remember that another election was held. This was a special Senate election in the state of Georgia wherein both of their two Senate seats were up for grabs. It was basically a runoff election because no candidate had gotten 50% of the vote. And so while the presidential election took place on the 3rd of 2020, the special Georgia runoff election took place on January 5th of 2021. And in that two month interim period between the two elections, an organization called True the Vote was working to clean up the voter rolls over in the state of Georgia. Specifically, during this window of time, quote, true the vote, it's founder Catherine Engelbrecht and several others had raised questions about whether 364,000 Georgia voters were improperly registered because their voter registrations conflicted with their mailing addresses. Essentially, what this organization did was that they compared the mailing data that they had on hand with the data that was on the official voter rolls in the state. And they found discrepancies in the form of people not living allegedly not living in the state and the county where they were registered to vote. And so what this organization did was that they helped people at the local level file election challenges. Quote, Georgia law requires that voter challenges be made by other voters living in the same county. As two Georgia runoff elections, which were believed could determine control of the US Senate approached on January 5th of 2021, True the Vote narrowed its challenge list to about 39,000, eliminating those with a legitimate reason to live elsewhere, such as college students and active duty military. They then found volunteers to make challenges in about 40 of Georgia's 159 counties, meaning that because there was not enough time before the actual election, they narrowed down their list to just 39,000 names, people whose addresses they believed were different from what was on the voter roll books. They then not only helped the people at the local level file the actual challenges, but also, quote, true the vote offered bounties from a $1 million reward fund for evidence of election malfeciance and sought to recruit citizen monitors to patrol polls and ballot drop off locations. Essentially, they were recruiting people to monitor ballot drop boxes as well as paying people bounties if they were able to provide evidence of election wrongdoing. Now as a practical matter, their efforts in this particular election did not really bear much fruit. The voter roll challenges did not really go anywhere, and in the end, the two Democrat candidates, John Asuf and Raphael Warnuck, they wound up winning the Senate runoff elections. However, this is where the story you can say took on a bit of a twist. That's because this right here is Miss Stacy Abrams. She is a Democrat who ran multiple unsuccessful campaigns for Georgia governor, and this is Fairfied Incorporated, an organization that Miss Stacy Abrams founded. What happened after the runoff election is that Fairfied Incorporated filed a lawsuit against True the Vote on behalf of several residents of Georgia. Their claim was that by questioning the voter rolls and by helping local Georgians to question the authenticity of the voter rolls, True the Vote was engaging in an act of voter suppression. According to their lawsuit, Fairfied made the argument that, quote, finding actual fraud or ineligible voters was only a secondary concern for True the Vote, and that the real intention was to frighten Democrat leaning voters from turning out in what were expected to be razor-thin runoff elections that would determine control of the United States Senate. But the fact that the argument was that the argument was that the statement was making the claim that by questioning the validity of the voter rolls, True the Vote was actually in violation of the Voting Rights Act. And just for your reference, the specific part of that law that they claim was being violated was Section 11, Subsection 2, which reads this, quote, no person, whether acting under color of law or otherwise, shall intimidate, threaten or coerce or attempt to intimidate, threaten or coerce, any person for voting or attempting to vote. And so you see, on the one hand, the argument was that the social media posts, articles and podcasts appearances by True the Vote urging people to challenge the voter rolls constituted a form of voter suppression. On the other hand, though, True the Vote's legal team was making the counterargument that their actions, including their search for illegal votes, was fully protected under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. And so these were the two competing arguments in the case, which plotted along in the legal system for about three years before finally getting to trial. Now, eventually, the case did make it to trial. And at the hearing both sides, and considering the merits of the case, the judge ruled in favor of True the Vote. Specifically, in a fairly thick 145-page ruling, Judge Stephen Jones, who was appointed to the bench by Barack Obama, he ruled that this effort to challenge the eligibility of hundreds of thousands of Georgia voters did not violate the Voting Rights Act. Here's part of what he wrote, quote, having heard the evidence presented and the arguments made by the parties, the court maintains its prior concerns about the manner in which True the Vote utilized Georgia Law to challenge individual voters. The court, however, ultimately concludes that as a legal matter, the plaintiffs have not carried their burden to show a violation of Section 11b of the Voting Rights Act. The court entered judgment in favor of True the Vote. There is no evidence that True the Vote attempted to make any of the voters in this case feel timid or fearful, or that they experienced any actual reasonable intimidation. Essentially, what the judge determined here was that, for one, when True the Vote was using the social media posts, these articles and these podcasts to urge people to challenge the voter rolls, they were not trying to intimidate the voters themselves, since it's even dubious whether those voters themselves would have even known about the existence of these articles and these podcasts. And then secondly, the judge found that these calls to action were protected speech under the First Amendment. Now, as you would imagine, the defendants in the case were thrilled with the ruling, with Miss Catherine Engelbrecht, who is the founder of True the Vote, releasing this videos a response. And just for your reference, I'm going to speed up the video just a little bit so we can get through it faster. Hey, everybody, it's Catherine Engelbrecht with True the Vote, bringing you a great bit of breaking news. We've just learned from the Northern District Court of Georgia that the judge has rendered a decision in the case, Fair Fight, the True the Vote. And that decision is that we have been fully vindicated. Today is a great day for America. Today is a great day for trustworthy elections. You see, we were sued by Fair Fight back in December of 2020 when we endeavored to help Georgia citizens file lawful, electric challenges, basically asking their counties to take a look at the voter records because it would seem based on data that we could provide to them. It would seem that many of those voters, in fact, some 364,000, according to our data, had moved from either the county or state where that voter was registered. And so in so doing, we do a lawsuit from Fair Fight and we have been battling it out for three years. Today, I am thrilled to tell you that the court has decided in our favor in full we've beaten Stacey Abrams, Fair Fight, Mark Elias and his law firm and his gaggle of attorneys and the Department of Justice. Thank you to all of you who stood so steadfastly by us through these tumultuous times and there were some difficult moments along this journey. Many, many changes, but we have continued to stand strong knowing that it is right. It is not only right, it is necessary for citizens to stand for lawful elections, for trust where the elections. And today is a great example of why we should continue. Justice has been served. Thank you all. God bless each and every one of you and God bless America. On the flip side, however, you have Fair Fight Incorporated the Stacey Abrams organization releasing a lengthy statement of their own saying that the federal courts have failed to protect voting rights. Here's part of what they wrote in their statement. While there is much to make of the court's 145-page opinion, Fair Fight is disappointed that Georgians and voters nationwide must continue to wait for our federal courts to impose accountability in the face of widespread and mounting voter intimidation efforts. Now it's unclear as of today whether they will be appealing this decision, meaning that as a practical matter heading into the 2024 election, the question of whether or not Americans can challenge a state's voter rolls, well it's been adjudicated in the affirmative, broadly looking for illegal voters, does not constitute a form of voter suppression.

This is essentially what it means for the state right now. Anyone who gets a driver's license will now be registered to vote unless they choose not to. Approximately 1.6 million eligible voters in Pennsylvania are unregistered. This change will likely add tens of thousands of new voters to the roles. With Governor Shapiro saying, I see voter participation as key to strengthening democracy. Currently, 23 mostly Democratic-run states, plus Washington DC, have enacted some form of automatic voter registration, and of those 23 states only three would really stick out as Republican run. And starting Tuesday, residents who go to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, driver and photo license centers, to go get new or renewed license and ID cards, will be automatically taken through the voter registration application process unless they opt out of doing so. With Republicans in Pennsylvania saying, this unilateral action on the eve of what is likely to be a hotly contested and close election will cause many Pennsylvania voters to continue to question the security and results of our system. So essentially what he's saying is that he thinks more voters mean more Democratic voters.

I'm actually a huge believer in a brand that sets like one big campaign theme for the year, and then runs tons of content and ideas and everything based on that. They've got an idea more brand should do, and Equinox has been a killer at it. Ox Highlights include Make Yourself a Gift to the World. Great thing. Commit to something, and you can start to see the theme here between what they're saying and the words.

It actually has that audience, and I felt they did pretty well with it. Equinox made me row in this four-person inflatable boat. There have been some missteps, though. This We Don't Speak January campaign got criticized pretty heavily last year, because it's basically anti-new people coming into the gym to try and change their lives, and we probably shouldn't be anti-that in any way, shape or form. But I actually don't mind that all in all. I think it endears itself a bit, too. It's really specific audience, but I do just feel in general, it doesn't send enough of a message to actually be thematic for obviously more than just the month that it's happening in.

@matteo_il_pazzeo_video_7303707157961280814.txt," a disastrous decision that jeopardizes the voting rights of millions of Americans, potentially, has just been handed down by the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. In this decision, the Court concluded that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act does not include a so-called private right of action, a right that has been implied by the courts for many years. This means that only the federal government and not private groups or private parties can bring suit for a violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. You heard that right. Under today's decision, when minorities are disenfranchised through practices by the state or the federal government that discriminate against them on the basis of color, race, or language minority, only the federal government and specifically the attorney general's office can sue and not private individuals. This is a problem because it jeopardizes the ability of countless minorities across the United States to see their vote counted, because currently the vast majority of cases regarding the Voting Rights Act are brought to court through private groups. Additionally, this decision puts 100% of the power to bring lawsuit in the hands of the attorney general, and we know that the attorney general's office has discretion on whether to bring any suit to light or not. This decision is not only obviously very dangerous, but also very startling because it's a clear departure from established jurisprudence from the way courts traditionally decided in these matters. And here is the other problem, because the circuit is split between this decision and decisions in other circuits that have recognized a private right of action, this ruling will certainly be headed for the U.S. Supreme Court. And if you think a decision in this case is clear, think again, because in 2021, a Supreme Court ruling included a concurrent opinion by Justice Gorsuch that said that with that decision, the court wasn't at that time making any implied guarantees that a right of private action actually existed. That means that at least the portion of the bench is open to hearing arguments to decide whether the right of private action in those instances actually exists or should be called non-existent.

Okay so believe it or not the president of the United States has the power to pardon you out of jail. It's not very common but it's happened many times before I believe the last time was in 2020. But what does it mean when you get pardoned? Cool so being pardoned essentially means being let free and all of your crimes are being dropped. And normally the president would only do this just to really benefit their authorities. If the crimes not even that bad or just if the president wants to pardon you he will pardon you. For example you may have heard of the rapar code at black. I believe in January 2020 he got pardoned by the president Donald Trump. I believe he was originally arrested for false firing police information to buy a firearm. But good old Donald Trump comes along and pardons him probably just because he wanted to. Maybe Donald Trump likes his music. Anyone who's even been convicted of a crime is under investigation or has been charged can be pardoned by the president. However if you're under state investigation and the president doesn't have the power to pardon you make sure you follow my Insta P dots in my bio.,subjective

@mvsforwi_video_7307239045766139178.txt," Trump, you could always register as a Republican and vote against Trump in the primary. Hey everybody, so that was Scott Bennett. If you're not following him, maybe give it a shot. I really like his content. I think he's very entertaining and I've been following him for a while. What I like about that video is he's talking about how to use your votes strategically. Look, I know most of us don't like the two-party system for a number of reasons. You know, one of the reasons being is that our founding fathers said the void political parties, and what do we do with foreign political parties right away? And we essentially got down to two parties every single time. It leads us to choosing between the lesser of two evils oftentimes. It drowns out voices that don't politically align enough with one side or the other to be heard, even though they have good ideas. And in the country of 330 million people, it can be very hard to change from the two-party system. That being said, I really like Scott's video because it's all about thinking strategically. We have 330 million people. Each one of them has a vote. And so it can be very hard to get any sort of collective action on a number of things. But we actually agree as a country on a number of things. And so if we want to, we can organize small groups of people to go in and cast votes strategically in the primary where you get to tell the political party, this is who you're going to put up. We the people are choosing these folks to represent you as your standard bearer. Now, I'm calling my bias here so you guys understand where I'm coming from. I am a former Republican that turned to Democrat and am a Democrat now. I voted Republican in 2004 and 2008, voted Democrat thereafter. And I ran as a Democrat in 2022 for Congress here in the state of Wisconsin. And I did that because Republican policies don't do anything to help workers anymore. And Democratic policies generally do help workers and want to help rebuild that middle class. Now, I stitch this part of the video because Scott's 100% right. What you can do in many states is register as a Republican vote in the Republican primary against Donald Trump. And then vote for whoever you want in the general election. Some states that don't win primary, you can just choose your ballot when you get there as a Republican or a Democrat. You don't have to pre-register. You should check with your state. But if you vote against, if enough people vote against Donald Trump in the primers, he will not be the Republican standard bearer. But I also wanted to throw on the fact that Donald Trump is not going away. Whether he wins the primary elections or not, the media saying he will, I think he will, but if he doesn't, he is not going away. And guess what that means? That means that he's going to run as an independent. Now we have the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, RFK, and Joe Biden. We have a four-way race. Look, if you hate Donald Trump or you just want more candidates on the ballot period, I think this is honestly your best bet because Donald Trump has the means to continue on the campaign to election day. And I don't know of any other candidate that can do that with all the major party backing.",subjective

Surrogacy has been illegal in Italy since 2004, and currently has a punishment of up to two years' imprisonment and a 600,000 euro fine. Prime Minister Georgia Maloney supports the ban, and to conference, she said, maternity is not for sale, rooms cannot be rented out.

@skybailey__video_7331922550534065426.txt," As a business, you should be sending one email campaign per week. But if you already have this in place, you have the resources to create the emails, but you also have the time to dive into your email marketing systems and start segmenting your customers. You should be sending many more emails now that you have more time and resources in place. You're ready to up your campaign strategy. I can't do the strategy for you, but I can definitely give you a bit of a helicopter view of a few things to think about so you can start creating what that looks like. Regardless of the size of your email list, you should rarely be sending to your whole email list. The only time you should do that is that peak sale periods and usually only do that for the first and the last email within that period. Or if you have some major announcement and I'm talking major for some businesses, this may be a new arrival or a new collection. If this is something you harp on about, but if this is not something that you actively promote, having new arrivals is not a very big announcement. So that brings me back to your engaged segment. You should always be focusing on an engaged segment with majority of your email campaigns. So when you're talking about your new arrivals or your restock, all of these emails are going to go to an engaged segment. Now depending on the size of the segment is going to depend on your business. Some businesses work well with a 60 day engaged segment. Others work well with a 90 or 120 engaged, but the happy medium is a 90 day engaged segment. Main reason we send to an engaged segment is based around deliverability and keeping our deliverability metrics high. I've got plenty of videos on them, so go and stop the shit out of that. Consistency of these emails is really going to depend on your business structure. You may send five a week, you may send two a week, but you really want to be looking at this as like your top level sense. We're not even talking about proper in depth segmentation just yet. Now we're moving into segmented sends and this is much more of an advanced thing to do within your email marketing. But if you have the time and resources to do this, then it's a great way to really hone in on your customer and also make some extra revenue. I'm not going to give you a particular number that you should send per week because again, this is going to depend on your actual business structure and what's happening in that week or in that month and why you would be segmenting down your subscribers. Examples of these would be certain loyalty programs. Maybe you're offering an extra percentage off because they're a loyal customer. Maybe they bought one particular product, but you know it's a very well selling product. And there's another product that is a similar fit for example, and that people are absolutely dying over. So you're going to make a segment of people who have purchased that product, but not that product. I honestly find that businesses that have time to segment have a lot more time and resources within their business to be able to create more email campaigns. You're not yet at this advanced segmented moment. Really focusing on your engaged segment is really important because keeping those deliverability metrics high, making sure that people are buying from your emails. You'll also get more of an understanding of the way that your subscribers interact with your emails when you especially when you start lifting up the amount of emails that you sent. You may see a positive or negative impact on that.",subjective

@lizkuhn__video_7325980693132053803.txt," Missouri, what are you doing? Because voting in your presidential primary is very difficult, but I'm here to explain it to you. And if you don't live in Missouri and you wanna know how to vote in your presidential primary, just leave your statement in the comments and I will reply with all the information that you need. You guys used to have open primaries. It was easy, it was simple, but not anymore. Because in primaries, you can only vote in one political party. You can either vote Democrat or Republican, you can't do vote. And there's a different date for the Republican versus the Democratic primary. And not only that, but the Republicans are doing a caucus, I'm gonna make this make sense. My goal is to make this make sense. If you wanna vote for the Democratic candidate in Missouri, you're voting in a regular open primary. That means that if you register to vote as Republican Democrat, unaffiliated, independent, whatever it is, you can vote in this primary. It will take place on March 23rd, 2024. And you must register to vote by February 21st, 2024. And I know that that's a couple of weeks away, but register now, register after this video, register tonight if you have to, but do it as soon as you possibly can. Because it would be such a shame to get all of this information, be so ready to vote and not be able to, because you forgot to register. Now, if you want to vote for a Republican candidate in Missouri, I'm sorry, it's gonna be a little bit more complicated. First off, you have to register to vote as a Republican or unaffiliated and get this. Instead of just going in on voting day and voting for the person that you want, casting your belt, putting it away, going back to work, they're holding a caucus. And I'm gonna say caucuses, they're a little bit confusing, but basically what they are is instead of casting a ballot, like I said, you get in a room full of people from your county and all the bait as to who the county wants to be their presidential candidate. The location, of course, is different per county. So depending on the county you live in, you're gonna have to look on the Missouri Republican Party's website and get that information, but it will happen on March 2nd. March 2nd, 10AM caucus. So if you're voting Republican for this election in Missouri, good luck. You're about to debate for who knows how long on that day definitely take off work. And also don't get it twisted because for the state election, not the presidential election for the state election on August 6th, Republicans are just holding a regular primary. But for some reason, for the presidential election, they've gone caucus. Good luck finding a voter registration deadline. If you wanna register to vote as a Republican in the Missouri 2024 primaries, or I guess caucus at this point, you need to do it now. I cannot find that information.

@ariella.elm_video_7343344256947539246.txt," Super Tuesday was yesterday and California had the lowest voter turnout in recent memory. As of 3am, 18.1% of registered voters voted. The thing that's so infuriating about that is that there is no voter suppression in California. Everyone gets a ballot mailed to them. There are ballot drop boxes everywhere. You can drive up to the polling place and drop your ballot off night of the election. You can mail your ballot and as long as it's post-marked, as the day of the election before polls closed, it counts. We get sample ballots on top of the real ballot. We get another booklet telling us about all the candidates. You have to put effort in to not vote in California. And the turnout this election was 18.1% as of 3am. It might go up a little bit, but it's not going to go up a lot. I get not thinking that it's important to vote for president right now in the primary. We know who the candidates are going to be and that's going to be the case whether we like it or not. But we had a Senate election. We had Congress as we always do. We had State Senate and State Assembly. We had City Council and Mayor and all other things that come with elections. And it's because of California and New York that we lost the House in 2022. But 18% turnout and I don't know what to do. I feel completely helpless. How can I get more people to vote? To realize that this is our right as Americans. This is how we get our voices heard. You don't like the person you have to vote for in the general? Well, did you vote in the primary? So did you vote? I promise I won't judge you if you didn't. I'm just wondering. And do you have any ideas to get more people to vote? Because Democrats win elections every time we turn out. But we're not turning out. So there's a real risk that we lose elections.

@nyclawguy_video_7243801391918042410.txt," Hello, Tiktokers. Welcome to the Reloq Talk. Today we're going to take on the weighty issue of Ken, the president of the United States, pardon himself. Let's review the first thing is the presidential party is granted by the Constitution. There are no limits to how many people be pardoned or shaped. The only limits are I can't be for any future crimes and I can't be in cases of impeachment. The president can also only pardon someone for federal crimes, not state crimes. So a president of the United States is convicted in a state court or someone else's, the president can't do anything about it, the governor's can. To the question of whether the president can pardon himself is very, very tricky. The one thing about the pardon powers is it's in the Constitution that's given to the president. So a lot of scholars believe that there will be no judicial review of this. The presidential pardon powers are purely political. It is only the president who gets to make that decision and presidents before they leave office, they usually shoot off hundreds and hundreds of parties. Some of them are for good deed, some of them are for worthy causes that people may believe. Some of them are purely politics, which the president sees a political position. The question of whether a president can pardon himself, there's a longstanding tradition in English common law that we brought over here that no man can be judged against himself or judge himself. After I reviewed some of the legal thinking on this and I don't believe that a sitting president has the authority to pardon himself. I read an argument about when the founding fathers were giving this power and they said, what if this president has a scoundrel tries to pardon his co-conspirators and they said, oh, we'll just impeach him if he does that. So based on that, I don't believe the founding fathers ever intended to give the sitting president the power to pardon himself. The bigger problem is that I also don't believe that it's a matter that the Supreme Court would either want to review or have the authority to review based on their precedent because pardon is the political act. So it's very complicated. It would be something that's never been done before, but we're facing a lot of things that have never been done before and that's where I'll talk.",subjective

@americanpolitiks_video_7345696134272257326.txt," Hello everyone, it's your favorite president speaking to you on a really great day of victory. One week ago we had something called Super Tuesday and it was indeed super because we won at numbers that nobody has ever seen before, records in virtually every state and tonight likewise. But this one got us over the top, the Republican National Committee has just declared us the official nominee and so with the official nominee of the Republican Party, which is a big deal. But most importantly we now have to go into victory because our countries in serious trouble. We have millions and millions of people flowing in, we have no respect on the world stage, what we say doesn't mean a thing anymore and to have that happen is unthinkable. We have an economy that outside of certain little areas is doing very poorly and we have something very, very important. We have a United States military that has to be taken care of. Again, this was a great day of victory last week with something very special Super Tuesday, but now we have to get back to work because we have the worst president in the history of our country. His name is Joe Biden, sometimes referred to as cricket Joe Biden and he must be defeated. Our nation is failing. We're a nation that is in serious decline. We've never had a situation like this where we're not respected, we're left at, we're considered almost a joke. We're going to turn it around, we're going to drill baby drill, we're going to close our borders, we're going to do things like nobody's ever seen before and we're going to make our nation's economy be the best ever in the world. We had the best economy ever just a short while ago and we're going to have that again. We're going to have people come into our country but they're going to come in legally and we're going to get your energy costs down by numbers that nobody would have said even possible. We have some sections of this country that are paying the highest numbers in the history of our country and among the most expensive energy anywhere in the world and yet we have more liquid gold I call it under our feet than any other nation. Just three years ago we were energy independent and now we're going around begging for energy. So we're not going to have that anymore, we're going to have a strong country, we're going to have a respected country, we have to win an election and we shouldn't win it by a lot because there's never been anybody worse at doing that job than Joe Biden. So we're not going to take time to celebrate, we'll celebrate in eight months when the election is over. November 5th I believe we'll go down as the most important day in the history of our country. So start thinking about it, start thinking about your vote because this vote is going to be the most important vote you've ever cast. And again, for this evening and for last week and for all the weeks before, for the tremendous success we've had in this primary, I want to thank everybody but much more importantly we have to get to work to beat Joe Biden, the worst administration, the worst president in the history of our country. They are destroying our country and we're not going to let that happen. Thank you very much.",subjective

An average two-in-five Americans don't vote in presidential elections and three-of-five don't vote in midterms. In local elections it's even worse, about 75% don't vote in those. One main reason that people don't vote is that there aren't any candidates they're excited about. So what can we do to solve this? The choice voter gives non-mainstream candidates a better chance of winning and encourages them to run. With more candidates representing a broader set of views, you'll have a better chance of finding someone you're excited about.

During the early 60s, no place in the nation had a tighter grip on Jim Crow than Dallas County, Alabama, where African Americans made up the more than half of the population, yet only accounted for 2% of the registered voters. In January of 1965, Martin Luther King, Jr. came to the city to make some of his inflexibility on voting rights at National Concerned. The SCLC hoped to gather momentum for federal protection for a voting right statute, but even peaceful demonstrations in Selma and the surrounding counties resulted in the arrests of thousands of protesters. February 18th, protesters, Jim and Lee Jackson, were shot by Alabama State Trooper and would be unalived just a day later. In response, civil rights leaders planned to take their cause directly to Alabama Governor George Wallace on a 54-mile march from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery. Although Wallace would order state troopers to use whatever means necessary to prevent the march, approximately 600 protesters set out from Brown Chapel Ami's Iron Church on March 7th to complete the march. John Lewis and other activists from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference began the march from Selma, Alabama to Montgomery, when they arrived at the Edmund Peters Bridge. They were met with police and state troopers wearing helmets and armed with bullet clubs. The officers demanded the protesters turn around and when they refused, the officers used tear gas and physically attacked the peaceful demonstrators as a result almost 50 people were injured and ended up in the hospital. Later that evening, NBC News interrupted an airing of the judgment at Nuremberg, a movie that examined Nazi war crimes and the more responsibility of those who followed orders when I was speaking out against the Holocaust. Two broadcast horrifying footage of the violence in Selma, Alabama, approximately 50 million Americans who had been eagerly awaiting the film's debut were confronted of these shocking images and it helped rouse support for the civil rights movement. Two days after the march, Aged civil rights supporters to come to Alabama for a second march. Members of Congress though suggested that the march be delayed and to the court could decide whether or not protesters deserve federal protection. King was uncertain whether he should wait and eventually decided to hold a second march but the march would end at the Edmund preacher's bridge once again due to the presence of Alabama State Troopers. On March 21st, a successful march will begin with federal protection. The events of Selma helped galvanize public opinion and mobilize Congress to pass a voting rights act with President Ledda B. Johnson with Sin and to law August 6th, 1965.",subjective

Laura Trump, the co-chair of the RNC, essentially just endorsed ballot harvesting, which Republicans never do, or at least very rarely do. But now she's decided that the RNC's official platform is to full force ballot harvest. So what is ballot harvesting? Ballot harvesting is when people can come to your door to collect the vote, whether you're voting by mail or absentee. What that means is you can activate a whole new voter base by going and knocking on people's doors to ensure that they vote. This is super controversial because there's a lot of legalities around ballot harvesting, and there's been a lot of lawsuits in both red and blue states. But Laura Trump has taken her gloves off. She said if Democrats are going to do it, so are Republicans. Now there are some drawbacks. Different states have different rules and regulations around ballot harvesting, but most of them is perfectly open. And with some of them the regulations are so lax, it doesn't really matter. Now remember, ballot harvesting isn't just for the president. The control of the house is going to be determined by just a handful of congressional races. And most of these are in states where ballot harvesting is okay. So Laura Trump has actually shown herself to be quite an aggressive political strategist. And maybe that's exactly what the RNC needs.

But the platform above all for me is a new kind of government called self governance and it's close to self governance is humanly possible. So I believe in people to self regulate and here's what happens when they are regulated regulated. You're late for work. And the guy in front of you has decided that he's the whole monitor. He is there to make sure everybody goes to speed limit because he's a good boy and he wants everybody else to be a good boy. And you want to kill that man because your job is at stake. Your boss though. Do you one more time? Right? I think that's where traffic fatalities come from is people being super pissed off and being a little bit reckless. I believe that the amount of tension it would relieve in our society to be able to do what we got to do and we got to do it man. And plus our cars go so fast. They're so awesome. Our cars are amazing. We don't get to open them up. You look at the speed lamer. Look at that. 110. I don't get to go 110. I want to go 110. You know, there would be things that come about that had to be addressed like bullying somebody who felt like because there's no speed limit he's allowed to write up on your ass and get his maximum speed because the the law is now maximum speed. It's not. So you know, we would have to react. We'd have to have cameras in our cars stalled factory. And so there'd be laws stringent laws around harassment. Right? Using your the ass end of your car to harass people is a type of harassment as is using the front end of your car to try to harass people for what you want to go and you know what your personal mentality say some people don't want to go that fast. Fantastic. I get it. My wife was like you drive so slow and I do because you know, I'm listening to the truck and the trend in the suspension and listening to the tires and road conditions. Never mind. It's not about that. But we can figure it out. We do not need to have someone standing on our necks telling us when we're not in a hurry. Right? I mean, if you get in an accident, then there's laws that apply to that. And so that's that's part one of traffic. I you know, no president said ever talked about traffic and it's it's a big part of our life. The other thing is I would convert a stop most stop signs in the stop yields, which means that when there is a chance to go and the other three directions of traffic, there's no one around and there's a whole line of cars waiting for that stop sign. Everyone doesn't have to stop at it individually. We just all go as a big ass snake. We all traffic flows. And again, we're less frustrated on the road, less likely to drive with volatility and thwarted, you know, thwarted intention is a very big thing for humans. We don't like it. We don't like people that hold us back, hold us down, keep us back in prison. us anything like that. It's it's one of the worst things for us. So a stop yield is where, you know, the laws, if there is an accident, the laws of a stop sign apply, whose turn was it? Who got to the thing first? Was it right turn left turn or straight? So when it came time to litigate the accident, it's a stop sign. But when it comes to the actual use of that device, if it's clear and it's safe and you're not going to endanger anybody, I recommend you keep going through that sucker. It is a safe gas man. I get this eight cylinder, get that thing up going again. Oh, half a tank. Right. And then the third thing as far as traffic goes is the zipper when a lane changes down. And there is a sign that says a lane is changing right at that moment. You look to your right, you look to your left, you and that guy got to work it out because you are now going to become one lane right at that moment. If you race up, you will be faced with a heavy fine because that pisses people to fuck off. It creates hostility on the road and thus more unsafeness. More people like fuck it. This is my day to go. I'm so pissed about that guy pulling ahead. I've been waiting here. So damn long. And this brick and little prick ass. You see people like put their car in the way. Not on my watch. Right.

So it almost seems as though that wouldn't even be my mom in heaven at that point.

@emibugg16_video_7331063762163698987.txt," I'm going to start showing the people that I am looking further into for presidential campaign because I hated the way Claudia and Karina handled all the questions that we had for them. So like they said, I'm not getting off my phone because I'm helping you guys and we're all learning together. So I know that we hate the two party system and we want it dismantled, but that might take a while and I have come to terms with that. There is a Democratic person running simply because he doesn't want Trump or Biden to win. There's more, but like that is in his statement and this is him. Dean Phillips is from Minnesota. He is a US representative from Minnesota, so he has been in politics. Obviously, I don't know anything else besides this page right now, but I'm going to re-use some of his opening statement, literally the statement that comes up first. I didn't set out to enter this race, but it looks like on our current course, the Democrats will lose and Trump will be our president again. This is a last minute campaign, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Courage is an important value to me. I know this campaign is a long shot, but that is why I think it's important and worth doing. This forming issues are bringing down the cost of living by being pro-worker and pro-business and proving community safety by addressing mental health and drug issues, which we need in Portland a lot. Investing in young people and making politics less divisive by pursuing policies like term limits, love that. Campaign finance reform, love that and bipartisan presidential cabinets. Sorry, at the end there I was looking to see if there's any more I could read to you right there. So it shows us also his finances. It looks like he has a little over $4.5 million for this campaign, which is actually crazy. Biden has $44 million, just a little over $44 million. This is his stance on immigration. He says, my family came to this country for the same reasons as many others for opportunity in a place of refuge from persecution. The America I know and love is a compassionate America that values and welcomes hardworking people who come here with big dreams and a simple wish for a safety and opportunity. This is not a Republican or Democratic issue. It is a human issue and an economic issue. We must do better. I'm not sure what that means, but okay. On health care, he wants to develop Medicare for all. It would eliminate deductibles, copays and surprise bills, which is really nice. It's going to have the umbrella of coverage, including dental, vision, hearing, mental and emotional help, substance abuse treatment and recovery, reproductive and maternity care, long-term care, inpatient outpatient services, prescription jugs and more. Alongside the Medicare for all, Dean wants to end the pharmaceutical industry's price scouting of hardworking Americans by implementing a 90% X-size tax on any price incremental to what is offered to our neighbors, I think by our neighbors, is what it's supposed to say. Canada and Mexico. Americans will no longer accept this inequitable policy. Okay, I love that because insulin should only be like $15. Not $300, $600, $600, $800. I'm pretty sure that it's like $15 in Canada. So Dean is saying that Mexico and Canada, if their prescription prices are what ours are going to be, we are not doing this run by big pharma anymore, which is amazing. Oh my gosh, that is definitely something that I stand for. I think that prescriptions cost way too much fucking money. On education, another very important topic to me, we must work together at all levels of government to ensure that every American child receives a world-class public education, no matter what their race or zip code, I've spent the majority of my adult life working to create more opportunity for young people, and I will continue to make that a top priority as a member of Congress. So he's a member of Congress right now, but like he's running for president. And with that, next gun regulation. Oh my goodness. Dots and tweets don't save lives. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Courage and actions save lives. For too long, Congress did nothing in the face of an epidemic of gun violence in our country. I'm proud to be a part of a new generation in Congress that made gun violence prevention of priority, which led to the passage of the bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the first meaningful gun violence legislation in nearly three decades. More must be done to keep our kids in community safe, however, and I remain as committed to this work as ever. On abortion, he stands with women. He says that women's rights to make decisions about her health should be protected. And then with the government ethics, he says, no matter your number one issue, I ask you to make campaign finance reform your number two, the corrupting influence of special interest money and politics like APEC. He didn't put that. I added that. And the time spent in its pursuits are at the heart of the dysfunction in Washington, the preventing progress on the major challenges we face as a country. That is why I am on a mission to get money out of politics and return power to where it belongs, the people. Okay, man, he just keeps getting better and better and better. I'm going to show you his campaign videos in the next, in my next videos. So stay tuned.",subjective
@vox_video_7257906838291647787.txt," Raise the voting age in this country from 18 to 25. Vivek Ramaswamy is running for president as a Republican. And he's pretty popular. A recent poll in Iowa put him in third behind Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis. And technically he doesn't want to raise the voting age for everyone. He says that people 18 to 25 would still be able to vote if they pass a civics test or serve in the military or are a first responder. But let's look at the views that people that age tend to hold. Among 18 to 29 year olds, three out of four, say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Two out of three of them say gun laws should be stricter. Only one out of 10 say gun laws should be less strict. We also know that in the last presidential election, young people voted for the Republican less than any other age group. So maybe not a coincidence that Republicans are now trying to limit students' ability to vote. Idaho just passed a law prohibiting the use of student IDs for voting. Texas is trying to pass a law that would eliminate every campus polling place in the state and the list goes on. And you can now add to it the idea that we should",subjective

@mad_mitch_video_7299207510064450847.txt," Thank you so much to everybody who's already verbally committed to vote for me as the next president of the United States. It really does mean the world to me, especially considering that this is a goal that I've had since this time yesterday, but campaigning is a full-time job. So here's part two of my presidential platform. First up, I will be adding a new branch of law enforcement that will consist solely of true crime, grilies, and scorpios, and I know what you're thinking, Maddie. Did you just single-handedly eliminate crime? Yes, I did. Thank you so much for noticing. I have no doubt that this group will rise through the ranks very, very quickly and become the most effective branch of law enforcement. And that's a guarantee. I also will be implementing a Secretary of Vibed Curation, and this person's role will be solely to ensure that the country starts to feel a little bit more like a girls' bathroom in a bar, and I've considered many potential candidates for this role, but I have narrowed it down to Jennifer Coolidge. I think she's the best woman for the job, should she choose to accept her new position. I will also be making sure that men with podcasts with a few exceptions are placed on an FBI watch list, and this is because I take national security very, very seriously. And I do think that we live in a country where everyone is innocent and too profane guilty, and I believe in that whole heartedly, but I think some people should start somewhere in the middle. You know what I mean? I will also be working very closely with the Department of Education to ensure that the Barbie movie becomes mandatory curriculum. And this is because I think it would very, very quickly kind of shift in shape our socio-political climate in a way that would be positive and beneficial for everyone.

There is so much on the line, this election cycle, from saving our democracy, which means basically still having a country because Republicans are supporting fascism and authoritarianism rule, which AKA Hitler and Mussolini, they all did that. They want to take away, they want to take away. They took away a woman's right to have an abortion, should they choose. So women, you don't get to make decisions about your body if you want, if Republicans stand power. They're attacking the LGBTQA plus community. They're threatening to do with gay marriage and, and attack our transgender community. We cannot have a bunch of fucking lunatics running our country.

Please get out and vote for them. Complete your ballot. Vote all the way down to school board, because conspiracy theorists are taking over our schools and destroying our public education. They're taking over our study councils. And just running a muck, it is nuts out there. And if you care about being America, you will get out there and vote, and you will tell people to please vote Democrat. I know Democrats are not perfect.

And we'll always have a debate about taxes and health care and infrastructure, and we can get all of that accomplished if we're still a country. So please get out there and vote.",subjective

@abc7chicago_video_7347554203604192542.txt," the police. We're looking at turn out that hasn't been probably this low in the presidential year for at least 12 years. Eric Nisbit, a political communications professor at Northwestern University says lower voter turnout is common in a primary election. But for a presidential year, number of people are not going to be able to get the vote. The political experts we spoke with say it comes down to the candidates and the issues on the ballot and so far neither have been strong enough to bring people out to the polls. Two days from the Illinois primary election and voter turnout is significantly down from years past. Really we're looking at turnout that hasn't been probably this low in the presidential year. Numbers are unusually low. Latest numbers from the Chicago Board of Elections show so far. More than 131,000 ballots have been cast. That number considerably down from the same time period in 2020. More than 190,000 ballots had been cast. The voting is often driven by the top of the ticket. And Illinois this year we have no top. As we're an incumbent Democrat and their public and primary is basically over. So who's likely to turn out on Tuesday? Nisbit says voter behavior in this type of election. It's typically driven by passion for the party. Maybe 20% of voters, 15% of voters in each party are highly motivated. Those are ones are going to turn out. But for most people, voting is really about motivation. It's emotional. We don't have this at a national or even statewide level. ABC 7 political analyst Laura Washington says this favors incumbents and big political names. Doesn't look good for races lower on the ballot. That's a shame because those lower races have a lot of impact. The top of the bill is a lot of impact, particularly the judges, particularly the state representatives, state senators, those lower ballot races do really make a difference. Experts saying efforts to get out the vote, like what progressive Baptist church has been doing will be more crucial this year than ever. The black church understands civic engagement and the public square to be a moral imperative. And so we are doing our part and doing everything we can to help people vote.

I will say we have to be careful on what uncommitted voting looks like in every state. So for example, I'm in New York, we technically cannot vote uncommitted and I'll explain why here. So this map is a great example that shows why people in New York cannot technically vote uncommitted. Okay, so this is a label has keys basically New York State camp on committed but blank ballots are counted. And what this means is if we were to go to the primaries and do a write-in or say uncommitted that would not count. If we write in ceasefire, if we write in free Palestine, Jane Fonda, whatever other examples, that those would be discarded and not added to a tally. However, blank ballots do add to a tally. So in New York, coming April 2nd is when the primaries are, make sure to keep your ballot blank in order to still prove a point to whatever we call democracy in this case. And again, I will also include a link in places where you go and find links on TikTok. And you discover more of those specific rules for your state because it isn't exactly the same in all states. And unfortunately, if you're in Florida and Delaware, you just kind of, you'll have no choice. I'm sorry. But yeah, let's get this word around. Please share.

But then here's the New York Times swirl and I love quoting the New York Times because they get everything wrong. Would a three-way Arizona race help Carrie Lake? Her party isn't so sure. That's fake news and I'll explain it as we go. Republicans are growing anxious that their chances of capturing the Senate seat in Arizona will be diminished by a potential three-way race that includes Kirsten Sinema, the independent incumbent. They're trying to load up that they're worried about Kirsten Sinema. She went Democrat, went independent, she's not a player. Many political strategists had figured that a reelection bid from Miss Sinema who dropped her Democratic affiliation last year would split votes in her former party and increase the odds that Miss Lake, the controversial front-runner from the Republican nomination, Arizona, along with West Virginia, Montana and Ohio, has been seen as the best opportunities for Republicans to pick up Senate seats next year and win back a majority. Now that's true. There was early polling that showed that Kirsten Sinema and Rubin Gallego, the Democrat, who's running, would split each other's votes and let Carrie Lake easily march into victory, which I believe is still the case.",subjective

The case claims the 388 defendants invalidated themselves from holding public office, including Mike Pence, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris. The violation of the oath of office is serious. Doesn't this give the trial court power to remove individuals from office, including this court? Now it will be up to the Supreme Court to either take up the case or reject hearing further details.

We want to make sure that we can get everything that we want. So sometimes you don't always get what you want. You know, if you want biological children, there's ways that you can go about it. But then we have to go into the ethics of IVF. Like I still think and maintain that surrogacy is evil. There are things that you can't plan for. You cannot plan for endocrine cancer that you survived. Right? So it just is that you're not going to be able to biologically carry children. So how can we live and operate aside from that? We can go for adoption. That's one thing we can do. I think that, you know, if America was to be... And that's definitely something that I do want to consider as well. But I can't deny that I want at least one biological children, child or more. And then I do plan on fostering and all of that as well. But are you saying like in your worldview, I'm just kind of...

Would it also be evil if one of my sisters were my surrogate? That, that I don't think so. I think the problem is like the changing of money and hands for labor. Like that's odd. I would pay them if my sister was my surrogate, I would still pay her. I think that's weird. Why are you okay with adoption? If that's your problem, why are you okay with adoption? You know the money can't just hand in that situation. True. The kid's already born though, right? It's a fundamental, you're not renting a womb space. Yeah.

And I had a question and I got a couple really good comments on there, so thank you guys so much for that. But it had to do with the Uncommitted Delegate. This was a term that I have not seen on a ballot before and was talking to a friend of mine that does a lot more. Political sleuthing? I don't know what the word you want to use is. But there's a couple things that he brought to my attention. And if you live in Washington state, well if you live in any state, and I'd love to get some feedback on this if I am off. Hey, please tell me, it's not personal, I understand. And the five candidate names on the presidential primary, if you are choosing Republican, there are two names that my friend indicated that are no longer running for office. So why are they on the Washington state primary ballot? If you live in Washington state, stop and pay attention because if you vote for one of those two parties, you are throwing your vote away. If you are conscientious enough to vote in the presidential election or any election, make sure you know who is and who is not still running. So I'm not going to list who these candidates are. It's not it's not I'm not trying to hide anything. I'm just saying is all, but this uncommitted, uncommitted delegate. And I've never seen it before on any of the ballots, on any of the election mail that we get from the secretary of state. But we walked through it and this is what it sounds like. And if I'm wrong, hey again, please correct me. It's as a vote for one candidate listed on the ballot directly delegate a vote for one candidate listed on the ballot directs your party delegate to support that candidate at their national convention. Okay, that makes sense. We know how things work, right? If you vote, listen, a vote for uncommitted delegate allows uncommitted party delegates who represent Washington to decide during their national. Is this actually telling us that if you go into your Washington state primary election, sorry, and check uncommitted delegate that this delegate can walk into the national convention and choose for you. That is that shit crazy. If I've got that wrong, please speak up. I want to know. I'll do another update because I want to get the right information out there, but this is going on. This is and look, my tax dollars. I just got a little peel and stick sticker. It paid for a freaking sticker. Look at this. My tax dollars at work. Now I can proudly sit here in my home office and everyone will know that I voted. Oh my God. So yeah, one of the comments was, you know, we can go in and we can go in and vote because on the back of the envelope on the outside of the envelope in Washington, I have to say Republican or Democrat or my vote will not be counted. So you have to basically announce and that was a concern to me. I mean, if we truly have some issues in our election processes and getting things accurate, the people who count the ballots don't need to know on the outside of the envelope. Who's Democratic and who's Republican? That's completely unnecessary. And for you to threaten to take away my right to vote because I haven't select, I haven't blurted out to anybody out there that I'm voting Republican or Democratic. Washington State. So yeah, this was this was the insert and it's right here at the bottom if you want to know vote for one and if you vote Democrat, if you vote Republican, you may vote for one candidate or the uncommitted delegate, but not both. So it sounds like you're given the choice to say, I don't know who to vote for, you pick what's best for me, which is crazy. But yeah, some feedback would be great. I would love it. Get out there. If you are in Washington and you have not voted yet, please pay attention to the fine print people. And don't forget your lovely little tax paid sticker. It just cracks me up.

And I spend the majority of my work time in the city. I've seen that city over the past 30 years go from a haven of drug dealing murders, rapes, all kinds of bad stuff. I've seen it go from that to a nice, quiet, peaceful community where children are actually outside playing. And it's all because of our Mexican immigrants who have come here illegally and started businesses and everything like that. And they buy property. They rehab the property. They have beautiful property. They basically improve the whole freaking community that they move into. So we want more of those people. We just need to keep the bad ones out. We have enough criminals of our own. We don't need to import them. Right? So that's what I would do. We need to have a way to regulate the inflow though. And that's why we need the wall. Okay.

@tv47_ke_video_7357950109646130438.txt," An investor who has put in a factory, a big factory actually produces Kienka. And he gets excited, so excited that he wants the president to stay for 25 years. And then David Koseen, who is the area MP actually, again, Jamsen and makes it look like there was a discussion in Westpokota about it. And there was no discussion. I mean, those are his own dreams and ideas. And I'm actually, sometimes when the president is in your presence, and you didn't prepare what to say. Usually it's very likely that you'll be coming up with things that you can't even, even you wait. We'll wait and see if you can actually take a paper to the house and say, I want to change the constitution. So that's the problem with young people who just get excited. But my surprise actually is that the audience enjoyed that kind of thing. And the audience there was sitting people who were supposed to defend the constitution of the law of the Kienka. And they have said nothing about it. Whether they are ministers or people who have sworn and nobody makes a mention of it. There's no way one person can decide that they are going to change the constitution just because they're excited for that one day. This is the Constitution of a Kienka. It's a sacred document. It is very well protected. The Constitution of Kienka protected itself. Actually, even if she promised to defend it and you don't defend it, the constitution will defend itself. So we have a very good constitution. And so I'm not worried about that. I'm not worried about it. So what I worry about is these campaigns that are coming in early into the country, when the citizen is actually going through so much and then you start doing politics so early. As though it's going to put bread on the table. I think the law should be made so that at least you don't campaign too early. They should be a time for campaigning. This issue of time limits being scrapped has been learned or read about in the neighboring countries. And I think, I guess when you visit too much in this neighboring countries, you might think it's a good thing, because you've seen it work elsewhere. But not in Kenya. Kenya's democracy is stronger than that. And so I do not expect that we can copy, paste, what happens elsewhere. And I hope the president will stand up and tell this young man. Tell this young man that discussion should seize and seize completely. I want to be there when you're talking about this guy. And that's a question because the president was present there and he had not taken to the podium. He did moments after. And one would have expected that he would address that as a person who's a war to defend and protect the constitution of this country. That yes, you may feel they need to change it. But before you change it, I will protect this constitution. He went to the podium. He made no mention of it.

I'm here because every single day I have to worry about which liberties Republican legislators are going to choose to gut next.

If these people cannot be trusted to protect our most basic rights, how can we trust them to draw fair and impartial maps that will promote a healthy and vibrant democracy? They can't. We can't trust them. The Republicans in this committee and the others in the House and Senate don't care about democracy. They don't care about fair maps. All they care about are three simple things.

So today, the Washington Post ran an article to the surprise of no one that Vladimir Putin has been a very bad boy, and over the past eight years has been something like $300 million influencing US elections through dark money campaigns. So why is it a problem that Russia spent $300 million on US elections? As well as the world's national security or related to the agencies, or just my opinions, not the opinions, my lawyer, the DOD, department of all the security, or any other agency that I work for, or contract with in the past or in the future. Russia operates something called the GRU. That's their version of the CIA. And within the GRU, they have these groups called APTs, advanced persistent threat groups, and these APTs operate uniquely. Some are hacking groups, some work in political operations, some work in social media operations. The crux of them is to so distrust and chaos. Within my company, I'm part of a working team that addresses psychological warfare. Nested within psychological warfare, you have cognitive warfare. And cognitive warfare is the idea that foreign governments can shape the ideas of people within a country by using legitimate, albeit gray political apparatuses, which can be campaign funding. They can be dark money political ads. They can be social media groups that appear to be grassroots. Whatever it may be, their goal is to mentally beat you. They know that they have a difficult time, as has been evidenced in Ukraine, winning kinetic warfare. Russia does not have a real warfare machine. They just wanted you to think that. So what they do instead is try and influence elections by the means of manipulation and lies. Now I'm going to say something that you probably won't appreciate if you're conservative leaning. The candidates who have recently been put up by the GOP for primaries tend to use extremely divisive and sendery language by default. Because of this, they have become attractive candidates for funding via covert means from Russian organizations. Because of the dark money nature and LLC shell game you can play with United States corporations, it is oddly easy for foreign governments to create dark money groups via a shell organization to influence elections by funding candidates indirectly. It's a pretty big blind spot. I do think the Federal Election Commission needs to get better at this. It's not their fault. It's just that it's happening and we did a very poor job addressing it. In short, Russia has been targeting undereducated and under earning populations with divisive rhetoric to attempt to make the United States less stable to their benefit.

Here is Michael Beshlaw's a presidential historian explaining a bit. From you Michael Beshlaw, we do have something of a gerontocracy in the United States. The average age in the United States is 64. The average age in the house is a bit younger, actually it's 58. So there's a lot more younger, you know, they're younger, younger, young people in the house, younger people in the house. What do you make of the fact that we do have a politics in which people stay and stay and stay and just throw them away and on? Because like 100, when they let they stay and they're very reluctant to leave. Sure. Well, the upside is you get people with wisdom and experience and sure that was true of Diane, but it's a product of the politics that we're in now. You know, a politics where if you want to get nominated and elected, you have to raise an awful lot of money, you have to be extremely well-known, you have to be in that, that have a network. And usually the people who have all those things are older rather than younger. So it's a system right now that works against the idea of young blood coming in and a firebrand coming into our system. I hope that part of it changes. Yeah, especially in the United States, it's expensive as it is to run for office, learn all the money and politics of it. Here's the thing though, things are changing. Social media means a lot of people are getting name recognition when they're younger. The Justin's and Zoe's effort in name three. Raising money is always going to be a challenge. And until we get rid of citizens united, it will continue being a challenge. The bottom line is that the gerontocracy is not going to change because we yell about it. We have to lift up elected officials we want to run for higher offices so that they can get the support so a bunch of small dollar donations can compete with the one big donor from their opponent. Turnlimits and AIDS limits are fine, but at the end of the day, we'll still run into these same problems because of how much money is allowed to be in politics and how corporations are allowed to donate.

@0liviajulianna_video_7330357705930034475.txt," So let me ask you this, there's families of victims here today. Have you apologized to the victims? So that's Josh Hawley. He is the Republican Senator from Missouri. He is up for reelection this year and in my opinion he is definitely going to run for president in 2028. If not try to be vice presidential pick, I know a political rebrand package when I see one and Josh Hawley has very clearly been trying to make himself seem more reasonable and responsible ever since the 2020 insurrection happened because he was one of the people who was like leading the charge, fisting the air towards the mob. And ever since then he has been cleaning up his image. He's been making moves and he's actually voted with Democrats against conservatives even though in the state of Missouri, he doesn't really need to do that to win reelection. So for example, this is Josh Hawley. He has a 15% Biden margin. That means that Trump won a huge majority in Missouri in 2020 and Hawley realistically doesn't have to be super super super scared or concerned about losing his election bid, right? And even though that's true, he still has voted with Biden, a pretty decent amount of the time. So for comparison, this is Lindsey Graham, the Republican Senator from South Carolina. This is his Biden score. Here's Mike Lee from Utah and here's Ted Cruz from Texas. So even though Ted Cruz is significantly more likely to lose his reelection bid, he is still voted with Biden less of the time than Josh Hawley has. On top of that, Hawley was very hesitant to endorse Trump going into 2024 so much so in fact that Trump put out a warning to him and said be very careful before he came out and endorsed him in his reelection bid. And there weren't even some rumors that Josh Hawley was going to be his vice presidential pick. And Josh Hawley is thought out said, I will not be VP in 2024. I don't want to be vice president. Also, his wife is a hot shot Republican anti-abortion lawyer who's actively working in the courts to try to ban abortion medication and restrict abortion access. So she is exactly the type of Republican campaign Barbie wife that you would want if you were going to run for president. At least in their heads, not really in our heads because to us that's like fucking awful. But I know a political rebrand package when I see one and I know that Republicans don't posture unless they're trying to posture for something and that was 100% political posturing. And I know he's up for re-election this year but I don't think that that's what that's about because he's changed a lot of his dances and has taken some votes that Republicans have dinged him on. So yeah, I think Hawley's going to run for president in the next couple of years, which is gross. I actually did a podcast with Guy Kawasaki, the remarkable people podcast a couple of months ago. And I literally said in that video, I think that Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz are two of the smartest Republican lawmakers in the country. And Guy was kind of like surprised by that. And he's like really because they say and do so much stupid things and I was like, yeah, but they know exactly what they're doing. They know how to get attention and they know how to energize their base. And that's not even just coming for me. That's coming from Mitt Romney's memoir where he literally said that those two are very intelligent, very smart Republican strategy elected officials. So yeah.",subjective

@dremzrfree_video_7308492115187617055.txt," the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. It was incorporated in 1963. For 10 years prior to that, it was known as the American Zionist Committee for Public Affairs. APAC calls itself America's pro-Israel lobby. And according to its website, it has over 3 million members across the country and regional chapters working to quote, expand and strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship. End quote. You may know APAC as being one of the biggest and most recognizable donors to many of the members of Congress in your state. But contributing to campaigns is a relatively new function of the organization. Before 2021, APAC did not endorse candidates nor give political contributions. Its focus was on lobbying elected officials, not actually electing officials. But in a dramatic shift in policy, APAC began directly funding candidates and spending big on races in 2021. APAC Political Action Committee, APAC PAC, filed something called a statement of organization with the FEC just in time for the 2022 election cycle where it spent $50 million, including both direct contributions to candidates and outside spending like TV advertisements. According to APAC, it donated money to 365 candidates from both parties, including every single member of both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress. 109 Republicans who voted against the certification of the 2020 presidential election in America received campaign contributions from APAC. All in all, APAC gave money to 342 members of the 118th Congress. The 2022 elections were the most expensive midterms in American history with a total cost of $8.9 billion spent. Now, last year, APAC ranked 15th in total expenditure by a political action committee, according to data collected by Open Seagrids. But take a look at the other funders that APAC is competing against for that title, Act Blue and Win Red. They are Democratic and Republican Party machines. Save America is Donald Trump's money raising operation. The conservative club for growth, Emily's list, focuses on electing Democratic women to office. All of the PACs on this list are massively domestic-focused ideological machines. APAC is the only organization in the top 20 whose interests are focused entirely on America's relationship to a foreign government. Now, let's take a look at who benefits from APAC's largest. Here are the top 20 recipients in Congress, the House and the Senate of APAC money in the 2022 midterm cycle, according to Open Seagrids. There are members of both parties that come from every corner of the country with varying levels of experience in Congress. The Democrat Glenn Ivy of Maryland tops the list. He beat out fellow Democrat Donna Edwards in Maryland's House primary after APAC poured millions into pro-Ivey advertisements and mailers. Edwards was running for a second stint in Congress after serving during the Obama administration where she voted present, not even a no on a number of pro-Israel resolutions. So the money poured in against her, not even an endorsement from Nancy Pelosi could save her. Michigan Democrat, Hayley Stevens, unceded Democratic Representative Andy Levin. Here's what Levin had to say about that. I'm really Jewish, but APAC can't stand the idea that I am the clearest, strongest Jewish voice in Congress, standing for a simple proposition that there's no way to have a secure Democratic homeland for the Jewish people unless we achieve the political and human rights of the Palestinian people. APAC spent $4 million against Levin. He lost by 20 points. When Michigan Congresswoman Lucita Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American in Congress was censured by the House in early November over what some lawmakers called her rhetoric around the Israeli Hamas war. 22 Democrats joined Republicans in that censure vote. 18 of those Democrats received campaign funds from APAC in 2022, totaling more than $1.1 million. By the way, for these six of them, APAC was their top contributor. A growing list of progressive lawmakers who are vocal in their criticism of the government of Israel and its policies, and their support for Palestinian self-determination have inspired APAC to spend even more. As progressive lawmakers began calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, Slate reported that insiders expect APAC's 2024 spending to hit $100 million. In fact, United Democracy Project, which is a pro-Israel super PAC affiliated with APAC, is already spending money on attack ads against Democratic representatives Jamal Bowman of New York and Summer Lee of Pennsylvania. Lee has already got a primary challenger as do Cory Bush and Ilhan Omar pro-Israel donors have already signaled that they are eager to primary reshaded to leave and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Congressman Lee already overcame APAC's financial influence against her once. She tweeted criticisms of Israel's treatment of Palestinians in 2021, but as a candidate, she affirmed Israel's right to exist, but that's not good enough. APAC spent nearly $3 million in the primary alone to defeat Lee, and they almost did. She beats Stephen Irwin, who is third on the list of money given to candidates by APAC in 2022 by less than 1,000 votes. And if Congressman Lee wants to keep her seat in 2024, she's going to have to do it all over again. She joins me in studio after this break.",subjective

Before, police could only chase suspects if it was believed they committed a violent felony. Now, they can chase suspects suspected of violent misdemeanors, such as robbing a retail store. A San Francisco Chronicle investigation found that deaths related to police chases have gone up dramatically since 2017. 2.

Remedy, declare the rightful winner, or, and this could be the minimum solution, declare the 2020 election irreproably compromised and having new election immediately.

As a reminder, during the presidential 2020 election, Trump said multiple times that mail-in voting was fraudulent and would lead to a free election. The Texas Attorney General even said that it was a threat to our democracy. The GOP has now acknowledged that this may not have been the best move. Governor Florida Ronda Santa said that I think telling people not to send in a mail ballot is a huge mistake, and it ends up reducing the pull of prospective voters. Naturally, Trump started to change his tune saying that even though he may feel mail-in voting is still dishonest, we have no choice but to embrace it. Trump has also been promoting ballot harvesting, which is using third parties such as volunteers to collect ballots. There's even been a rollout by the GOP to promote mail-in voting. Chairwoman of the GOP, Ronda McDaniel, took to YouTube to implore conservatives to bank their votes and to go vote early to help close that gap.

@levertthebassman_video_7151420259466153262.txt," Okay, so let's talk about the Southern strategy. What is it? Well, the Southern strategy was concocted by Republicans in the 1960s and 70s as a means to gain more votes in the Democrats. Their strategy was to reorganize the Republican Party from the top down to make them more appealing to racist white voters in the South by passing racist legislation against blacks and using anti-black rhetoric in their speeches. Now most people think Kevin Phillips was the one who coined the phrase Southern strategy, but he didn't. He just made it popular. He said, from now on, Republicans are never going to get more than 10 to 20 percent of the Negro vote and they don't need any more than that. But Republicans would be short-sighted if they weakened enforcement of voting rights acts. The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South, the sooner the Negro-phobo whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans. That's where the votes are. Without that prodding from the blacks, the whites will backslide into their old, comfortable arrangement with the local Democrats. In 1964, this guy, Barry Goldwater, ran for president on a political platform that was so racist and so wild that it made Donald Trump look mild by comparison. This is what that election looked like the first time they used the Southern strategy. In 1968, Richard Nixon used the Southern strategy and won the presidential election of that year. George Wallace, who lost against Richard Nixon, ran on a political platform of just pure racism, saying this. By 1972, the Southern strategy was in full swing proving that whites loved that good ol' American racism, gaining Richard Nixon the presidency in that year. So what does the Southern strategy or being attractive to racist look like in practice? I'll let Republican strategists Lee Atwater explain. I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm obviously sitting around saying we want to cut taxes, we want to cut this and we want as much more abstract than even the busing thing and a hell lot more abstract than never lived.

The Amika's brief was signed by 137 Republican members of the House and 42 Republican senators, including Mitch McConnell, and was led by Ted Cruz and Steve Scalise. At the end of December, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled Donald Trump is disqualified from running for president under section 3 of the 14th Amendment due to his involvement in the January 6th insurrection. Section 3 prohibits someone from holding office if they've engaged in insurrection. That decision is frozen for now, but the U.S. Supreme Court will hear this case on February 8th and determine Trump's eligibility.

@darlenegross19972_video_7296893851502005550.txt," Representative Troy Nell's, a Republican from Texas, took to the social media platform X to announce his role as a witness in former President Donald Trump's ongoing trial in Colorado on Tuesday. October 31, 2023. In a compelling post, Nell's boldly declared, I was at the doors on January 6, face-to-face with protesters, and I know firsthand there was no insurrection, as reported by RSBN on Wednesday, November 1, 2023. Nell's went on to address the core issues of Trump's trial in Colorado. Notably the alleged involvement of the 45th president in the events that unfolded at the Capitol on January 6. Nell's, who expressed his honor at being called as a witness, firmly believes that this trial could have far-reaching implications for American democracy. He went further to label Trump's trial as clear election interference, and has no basis, in fact, at the heart of the Colorado trial lies the pivotal question of whether Donald Trump's name should appear on Colorado's election ballots, or if it should be excluded on the grounds of violating the 14th Amendment. The prosecution argues that a specific clause within the 14th Amendment warrants Trump's disqualification from Colorado state ballots. This clause stipulates that any individual should be disqualified from holding any form of political office if they have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. It is on the basis of this clause that the plaintiffs in Trump's Colorado case have petitioned for his removal from Colorado state ballots. There argument hinges on the contention that Trump's alleged involvement in the events of January 6 aligns with the criteria outlined in this clause, thereby underscoring the significance of Congressman Nell's testimony in this critical legal battle. The focus narrows in on the interpretation of the 14th Amendment's language. The plaintiffs maintain that Trump's actions on January 6 were tantamount to insurrection or rebellion, while supporters of the former president and individuals like representative Nell's assert the contrary. Nell's decision to act as a witness, drawing from his personal experience during the events of January 6, underscores the deeply divided perspectives surrounding the Capitol incident, with the trial unfolding in Colorado. The nation watches as legal arguments and testimonies, navigate the intricate terrain of constitutional interpretation, political narratives, and the definition of insurrection. As the trial proceeds, the impact of this case is expected to reverberate far beyond the state of Colorado, serving as a litmus test for the application of the 14th Amendment, in cases involving political figures. The ultimate decision of whether Trump's name will be allowed on Colorado ballots will undoubtedly carry broader implications for the ongoing discourse on the events of January 6, and the boundaries of political participation. This trial promises to be a pivotal moment in American political history, with its outcome likely to shape the future of electoral politics.",subjective

@lisaremillard_video_6919576435439062278.txt," No doubt you're hearing a lot about presidential pardons today. The Commander-in-Chief has a constitutional right to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, with one exception, except in the case of impeachment. Presidents usually issue a ton of pardons on their last day of their presidency to avoid any kind of political backlash for who they are pardoning on the way out the door. Now the power to pardon is very broad and virtually unchecked power that the president has to forgive federal crimes. Now pardons cannot be given for state crimes. There's the two most popular types of presidential pardons, or they full pardon, which absolves the crime and the punishment like it never happened. Then there are commutations where the punishment for a crime is reduced to something less severe, like commuting a death sentence to instead life in prison. Reportedly, President Trump, like his predecessors, is getting ready to issue a bunch of pardons on his last full day in office, and that's totally normal.

@samuelwfoster_video_7322576362760310058.txt," Today is my 35th birthday, and as it turns out, this is the age I am officially eligible to become U.S. President. And while I have no such aspirations, I felt like it was the appropriate time to reflect upon my relationship with the U.S. government. I feel confident that I reflect the position of many Americans, if not most Americans, when I say that the social contract between our government and its citizens has been abused if not all together broken. Corruption and greed seem commonplace in our government. Presidential candidates and their families are steeped in such allegations. One of my own senators in New Jersey is facing active bribery charges. There's no need to list the net worth of individual members of Congress. Much of their net worth vastly outpacing their salary is commonplace. Without the restoration of integrity and honesty within our elected officials, and without the destruction of the two-party system, that our founding fathers eagerly warned us against. I see only the continued subjugation of the American people ahead of us. I ask you all to just maybe consider these three points of action or spread this thought if you agree and to write your elected officials as I intend to. First, state elections and ultimately federal elections should be completed in a ranked choice voting system, which is currently done by the state of Maine and several others. It's a simple system that removes the stranglehold that our two-party system currently has over our offices by removing the risk of a third-party candidate vote being considered a throwaway. Google mains ranked choice voting and maybe consider writing your state and federal elected officials about it. Second is turn limits and age limits. We don't need turnover on every election cycle. There's value and experience, but we have seen elected officials reach ages and levels of coherence that, to me, constitute elder abuse and have the appearance of puppeteering and handling. You can serve the government for 30 years or until the age of 80, whichever comes first. Keep in mind that there is already an age floor with voting and with the presidency, so an age ceiling operates with the same purpose. And third, we need to create an aggressive tax on both the excessive income and growth of the assets of our elected officials. We cannot continue to allow our voice of the government to be stolen by the greed of those that we placed our trust in. Civil servants earning millions of dollars on our time needs to come to an end. While this may seem naive or obvious, I beg that you take some time to reflect on these ideas. Our state of division is by design and those that have perpetrated it against us, whether by convenience or malice, benefit at our expense. Without the restoration of the integrity and honesty of our elected officials and without the destruction of the two-party system, I see only the continued subjugation of the American people out of us. So God bless you and to those of you who are my age, look how far we've come since our way messages on aim. Take care.",subjective

The campaign is already hired an outside firm to vet candidates and prepare research documents. This is really funny, because what an outside firm does is you go and you get a Democrat firm and you hire them to do an investigation on all 12 of these vice president candidates coming up with the dirtiest dirt you can find on Twitter in their banking records, any arrest. It doesn't matter what you've ever done. They're going to completely eviscerate. They want all the bad news out now before they make the decision.

Melania picked Mike Pence. She picked Dr. Oz. How's that? And she likes Tucker Carlson for VP. Has been kept apprised and Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr. says he speaks with his father frequently about who is in contention. And Donald Trump Jr. has a list of young guys that he likes. And I disagree with him on his list. But he really likes Debuk Ramaswamy, for instance, and I just think he'd be terrible as a... I don't think he gets Trump anything as a VP pick. Here's news 18. That's the thing. Here's like, even if you was to pick, like let's say if he do pick a woman, let's say if he pick at least to find it. Can at least to find it like be the president like after that? Can she kind of control everything? Could she do it? I think she could. But you know, I understand, Doug said he don't like Viva. I actually like Viva. I really like his ideals, like fresh new ideals. I like Viva. But I did mention before that I like Byron Donald's man, and which overall out of everybody, I really, really wanted to be Tucker Carlson. I really do. I really wanted to be Tucker Carlson.

Volunteerly dismissed by the petitioner in Pennsylvania and Trump for president versus to loose Oliver voluntarily dismissed in New Mexico. This isn't all of them. This is only about 40. There are many many more. This is all I had time for. So if you're interested in looking up any of these cases regarding election fraud and the grounds that all of the courts dismissed denied dismissed the cases feel free to check out each one of those names in all of these different states. For anyone who has stayed till the end let me just make one more comment to any of the lawyers or attorneys who were involved in these cases. I'm curious how that worked out for all of you. Let me know.",subjective

@maxsdumbedits_video_7271237653931085088.txt," about the fact is that no one is telling the American people the truth. The truth is that Biden didn't do this to us. Our Republicans did this to us too. Our kids are never going to forgive us for this. And so at the end of the day, you look at the 2024 budget. Republicans asked for 7.4 billion in earmarks. Democrats asked for 2.8 billion. So you tell me who are the big spreaders. I think it's time for an accountant in the White House. You want something said, ask a man if you want something done. Ask a woman. So the way I come here, the less that you have no foreign politics here to end it. And you know what? We are not going to throw women in jail or give her the dance penalty if she gets an abortion. Let's treat this like the like a respectful issue that it is and humanize the situation and stop demonizing the situation.",subjective

@lisaremillard_video_7304103770038766890.txt," We just learned the candidates for precedent of the United States, whoever they will be, will be debating each other three times next year. But at this point, neither the Republicans or the Democrats have even agreed to allow their nominee to participate. So before I get into that drama, you should know these debates are being sponsored by the Nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates as they've been since 1988. The three presidential debates in 2024 will be held on September 16th at Texas State University, October 1st at Virginia State University, and October 9th at the University of Utah. The one known vice presidential debate will be held on September 25th at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania. So back to the drama, why aren't the Republicans and Democrats jumping on this? Well, if you remember back in 2020 when then President Donald Trump and then candidate Joe Biden were debating, there were lots of complaints from Trump about unfairness of the questions and he even refused to participate in the second 2020 presidential debate. Well, since then, the Republican National Committee has been considering adopting a new rule that would force Republican presidential candidates to sign a pledge saying they would not participate in any debate that was sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. And it's not just the Republicans who are unhappy with the Commission. The Democrats were also frustrated with the Commission back in 2020 over what they called its failure to enforce the rules when it came to Trump. Now, former President Trump has so far skipped all of the Republican primary debates and will probably continue to do so. But he has said he would debate Biden if both of them became their party's nominee. Biden's campaign has not explicitly said whether Biden would participate in a debate against Trump. Now, the Commission on Presidential Debates says, regardless of all the drama, all three of these debates will start at 9 p.m. Eastern and will run for 90 minutes commercial free. We'll learn more about the formats and the moderators for each of these debates next year.",subjective
@d.a.r.y.l.2.0_video_7343527265617153323.txt," It's funny that this has to be explained, but like every election it has to be. People were looking at this map and saying, oh California's turn in red, it's a close race between Garvey and Adam Schiff. You see a Senate race is a popular vote race. All these little county lines don't matter. The only line that matters is that border around the state if you follow me. So it doesn't matter how big your county is. It matters how many people live in it. We call it population density. But Darrell, the vote's not that far apart. Well for one reason and one reason only, because Katie Porter was running as well. That's the reason. The only one that votes for Katie Porter is not voting for Steve Garvey when it's just Adam Schiff and Steve Garvey running for office. Adam Schiff is going to absolutely demolish Steve Garvey. And honestly the only reason most Republicans are voting for him is you know how they are. They love celebrities. Well he used to play the ball. He played the baseball. I'm going to vote for that guy. That's all it takes to get him. No one loves voting for celebrities more than Republicans. It's been that way for over 40 years.",subjective
@mediawise_video_6882504950459550982.txt," Y'all, this Facebook video wrongly claimed that mail-in ballot envelopes show what your party affiliation is. They put R right here, and D right. The video suggests that postal workers could toss out ballots from parties they don't like. Let's fact check this together. To see if this was legit, I did a quick keyword search and right away I could see that this claim has been heavily fact checked by organizations like factcheck.org, USA Today, and the Associated Press. And according to factcheck.org, these ballots are from the Florida primary. Florida has a close primary meaning that voters can only vote in the primary of the party they're registered in. But in this general election, all ballots will look the same, regardless of a voter's party affiliation or who they choose to vote for. We rank this claim not legit. There's a lot of misinformation out there about mail-in voting. Just don't share it. Be skeptical opposed trying to prevent you from voting. Check with your local board of elections website for specific questions, and know that your party is not on your ballot.",objective
@mamasissiesays_video_7322515802358418718.txt," The Pope, the head of the Catholic Church, has called for a ban on surrogacy. He's deemed the practice of so-called surrogate motherhood deplorable. It represents a grave violation of the dignity of a woman and goes on to say that the child should always be a gift never a commercial transaction. I have questions. Is not the entirety of your religious ideology based on the fact that a virgin woman was impregnated without her consent by your god, the skydady? Like she's the OG surrogate mother. And now you're telling us that's a violation? It's literally the definition of what they call a traditional surrogacy. The mother is artificially inseminated with the father's sperm and then she carries the baby until birth. A more common practice is gestational surrogacy where a person is implanted with a fertilized egg that then becomes an embryo and a child at birth. In that case it is not the biological mother who carries the child but does so for another couple. And I know gestational surrogates and it is truly one of the most selfless things you can do, especially in this country where we know that women's health care is not at the top of the list of priorities. But here's the thing, gestational surrogacy only accounts for 750 babies born each year in the US. So this time of May and his all up in a person's uterus just to prevent 750 births a year. Do y'all want us to have your babies or not? I feel like you need to make up your mind on that. Also I feel like you have a significant amount of incantacies and contradictions to work through but I'll let you take that to therapy.",subjective
