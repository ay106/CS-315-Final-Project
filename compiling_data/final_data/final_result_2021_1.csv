The Republican National Committee, RNC, has withdrawn a resolution that aimed to declare Donald Trump the party's presumptive 2024 nominee before he formally secures the required number of delegates, according to a source familiar with the matter. The resolution, if approved, would have solidified Trump's position within the party and signaled a unified front ahead of the 2024 election. However, Trump expressed on his truth social platform that, for the sake of party unity, the RNC should not proceed with the plan. The withdrawal comes amid ongoing competition between Trump and other GOP candidates, notably Nikki Haley for the party's nomination. The draft resolution obtained by the Associated Press had declared Trump as the presumptive nominee moving into full-general election mode. RNC chair Ronna McDaniel had initially signaled support for the resolution, emphasising the need for Republicans to unikey around the eventual nominee. The decision to withdraw the resolution comes as the RNC's winter meeting approaches where discussions were expected to take place. Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, who finished second to Trump in the New Hampshire primary, has been actively campaigning, and her camp responded to the RNC's actions by stating that the party's nominee should be decided by millions of Republican voters, not Washington insiders. Despite the withdrawal, Trump continues to exert influence within the party, with a recent social media post, warning that anyone contributing to Haley's campaign would be permanently barred from the MAGA camp. The resolution's withdrawal indicates the complexity of managing power dynamics within the party, with concerns about potential disruptions to existing structures. It also reflects a broader debate within the GOP about the direction and leadership of the party heading into the 2024 elections. The decision highlights the challenges of navigating internal dynamics, and the preference for party unity, with the ultimate nominee yet to be determined. The RNC's move to withdraw the resolution underscores the ongoing jockeying for influence and support among GOP contenders, as they navigate a competitive landscape in the lead up to the 2024 election.",subjective

As I watched this hearing, I noted the difference in questioning by certain committee members, so I decided to do a little bit of digging, and what I found was rather interesting, especially as it relates to citizens united and political donations by corporations. In 2020, TransDiam donated $226,153 to Republican campaigns, but only donated $39,938 to Democratic campaigns. Their highest individual candidate campaign donations were $2, Martha McSally, $30,400, Tom Tillis, $23,500, David Perdue, $21,800, Johnny Onesd, $19,320, Kelly Lafler, $19,600, $1,000, all of these members of Congress, will or are current members of the Military Affairs Committee with the exception of Kelly Lafler. You remember Kelly Lafler, right? The Republican Georgia Senator who was suspected of insider trading after selling off stocks of companies that would have been susceptible to the COVID pandemic after she attended a briefing about COVID at the beginning of the pandemic. Well, wouldn't you know it? Mrs. Lafler and her husband own stock in TransDiam at the same time that she was a sitting member of Congress. There needs to be serious campaign reforms for both donations by corporations and stock clothing by members of Congress on both sides of the political fence. Members of Congress no longer work for the people. They are bat by and work for corporations. As far as TransDiam is concerned, the federal government has requested that the company refund a little over $20 million. This is the second time in three years that they've been asked to refund money to the federal government for overcharging. In 2019, they refunded $16 million.

So my best resource for you is going to be to check out the DBQ from 2015 at a disease centrally this question. You can totally just check out the DBQ on its own or you can go to the student samples because that includes the rubrics. You're going to get a whole bunch of information there. But generally, what we see happening is that by 1980, Democrats and liberals have had control of governments since 1932. Now, even though there were some Republican presidents in this time period like Nixon and Eisenhower during their Presidencies, oftentimes Democrats still controlled Congress. So Republicans just didn't have a complete control over government. So by 1980, conservatives were like, we need a new block of voters. We need to bring in a group of loyal voters to the Republican Party who will constantly vote for us, which will bring us power. So they start looking at some of these social movements that are happening at the time. So there is basically almost like a third grade awakening. It's not called that. But there's a big evangelical movement that's happening in response to backlash to the counterculture that's happening in the 70s. So they are responding to the drug culture, the hippie culture, the changes in gender roles, the Roe v. Wade court case. And so they're trying to, a lot of evangelicals are emphasizing more traditional values. And they're very apprehensive about social change. So Republicans see this big group of people that care about that and they decide to adopt some of those ideas into the conservative party platform to bring them as voters. And so we see a group called the new right, the religious right, the moral majority, really being brought into the conservative party. And that is going to lead in a large part to the growth of the conservative movement overall. Additionally, there's some economic things that are happening in the 70s. There's an economic crisis and an economic recession, energy crisis, stagflation, inflation. A lot of us going to be blamed on President Carter, who was a Democrat. So that will also contribute to the rise of the conservative party. Again, check out DBQ from 2015. Hope that helps you.",subjective

Thank you Mr. Ranking member. As I understand it the function before the archivist of the United States is what has been described as ministerial in function so the archivist is publishes an amendment when it is part of the Constitution not the decider. Very good and I think that's exactly right in some ways would probably be similar to sort of the certification of an election you know when the vice president comes in it's thought to be ministerial not that the vice president had the power to change or alter the election. Will you allow security at the archives to force people to cover clothing that has political speech on it? Thank you Mr. Ranking member for that question absolutely not. Will you get to the bottom of how it happened to make sure that we don't have people I don't know if this was some a rogue person out there doing this or if the previous those in charge were encouraging this but we promised to get to the bottom of it. Absolutely Mr. Ranking member. I think one of the things American people hate most about government is when it appears as if justice or the adjudication of justice is partial you know when you know Lady Liberty's not blind Lady Justice is not blind that there are different standards for people depending on their party and at least from where I said a lot of Republicans felt like there was a different standard you know and it'd be really in the way the FBI treated Donald Trump and Joe Biden. The bigger problem though I think is that everything is classified we just we classify everything the menu at the White House is supposedly classified I mean we've got problems with too much classification but it also makes oversight difficult so for example a million Americans died from COVID somewhere between 12 15 maybe 18 million people died worldwide from COVID and I can't get records from the NIH because they classify more they send them to the NIH I think it was HHS and is a 250 page document and redacted the whole thing. This is just sort of an insult and you know how we get to it you don't have complete control of this but I think you have some control over the older records how do you understand your role on the older records with being part of declassifying older records. Thank you for that question yes as I understand it the agency that classifies information has the responsibility for and the choice to declassify that information but there is the National Declassification Center at the National Archives located in Maryland and if I am confirmed I plan to of course visit the National Declassification Center and also prioritize as you said Mr. Making member the older records they're waiting for declassification figuring out how we can be most efficient in doing this and how we can strengthen relationships with those classifying agencies those classifying entities so that we are able to move some of these older documents through the process I agree with that and really just for the record here on the presidential you know controversy what we're stuck with now is you know millions of dollars will be spent on these investigations and there should be an investigation of neither Biden nor Trump nor Pence on this they should be told you know what these are rules and we should try to work with people that were in office I think we're not going to find that the secrets to making you know a nuclear weapon we're at someone's house I think we're going to find that a lot of stuff's classified that doesn't need to be classified but it began with sort of a witch hunt for Trump everybody loved it they love you know the media cackled and rubbed their hands together and it went on for weeks and weeks they had Donald Trump they were going to get him they're going to put him in jail like all the rest of the governments you know they're controlled by one party around the country they just had glee until Biden was found to have records in much less secure place next to his you know Corvette and his garage but I think we've overreacted to both and I've talked with a chairman and others on the other side that we need to do something about this this overclassification problem and what little part you can be of it and I realize and don't want you to create ball but what you can do on the older records I think we would appreciate trying to get less and I look forward to working with the chairman I'm trying to to change this because we can't have true oversight of government if HHS and NIH is telling us you know it's none of your business I mean we really have to get a hold of what's going on and to be the covid thing isn't about isn't about Biden at all a lot of this happened in the previous administration so really it shouldn't be partisan at all we should all want to find these records I'm going to reserve my time for later if that's okay that's fine,subjective

And the people graves and these people that knew it because they didn't want to face the reality of the lies they had told in the Dead ceiling bill. This is obvious. Not dumb to think people are. Now to do this he's also going to put forward McCarthy saying he's going to put forward a CR with the border enhanced border security. His question that he's quotes I don't understand how anyone would stand in the way of blocking the border. This is how dumb as you think you are this is HR two is nothing. It's not going to do anything for two weeks. That can be implemented. We have more than enough laws some HR two is really terrific.

I ran into so how do I say this politely personal issues. The Paul Ryan ascended to the chair because you had wait for it. Personal issues they had to be addressed. Now we're here and they're going to throw up everything and now you know Don Bacon and in the in the in the in the problem solvers that's a great group. The problem solvers all the geniuses the problem solvers they're going to give you a CR that goes to January. And then you're just see the whole thing wrapped up into one. Omnibus bill done so you got the problem solvers working with the Democrats. You've got the Senate coming in with something McCarthy's now saying it comes up it whatever way whatever angle they come for. It's all to one purpose to get past the 30th and have the apparatus continue to be financed. The purpose is we're trying to deconstruct the apparatus and the first step in deconstruct it is choke it off from money. Choke it off from the Federal Reserve just continuing on and on and on and on as you have this fiscal terrorism was what it is now. Control by the lobbyist. If this didn't work for the fat cats in the lobbyists in the donor class and the bayonets do you think this would be a thing with this be a fight now. That's what the fights about because they understand the first way to get after them is to cut this massive federal spending the out of control federal spending. And that's what they refuse to do and they refuse to tell you what the reality is. And you can see in every aspect and they have the goal in there to put 24 billion dollars. In for Ukraine now somebody found your point I think was the messenger my number because it's 60 minutes of 70 billion dollars makes it 40 billion dollars. Those are all lies you got to aggregate up everything we spend on these people. 113 billion and if it was for the benefit of the Ukrainian people maybe people are getting back of it's not it's the oligarchs over there the Ukrainian people have been thrown into the channel and she had 50,000 dead Ukrainians for what. So that you go back and fight over who controls buck moot to crossroads town of buck moot. 24 billion dollars government programs were talking massive cuts in discretionary spending I think massive cuts into defense bill. Which are going to be tough but I think necessary get economic warfare up there to the top and do not commit non kinetic means we cannot continue to fight and think about the words of the 20th century. But these cuts are going to be tough they're going to be I didn't say they weren't going to be tough and their arguments on some of these on both sides. Other than the getting the weapon weaponized out which there is no argument there but it's going to be tough it's just tough to get to this point when you really start cutting programmatically taking things out and that's some fantasy we're going to get 8% 8% is on is on non discretion is on discretionary defense or not defense and is for two weeks that's a fantasy it's another false flag. .",subjective

He was born in San Diego and graduated from the Stevens Institute of Technology. He started his career as a businessman in the software industry, having co-founded BrightWork development, which specialized in banking software. Him and his wife later co-founded another company called BrightNow Technologies. He amassed a fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars and was once called the Godfather of Montana Tech. Because of his wealth, his financial ties have come under great scrutiny. He got into politics when he ran for governor in 2016 against incumbent Steve Bullock. Despite sharing a ballot with Donald Trump, he narrowly lost the election. But Trump appointed Montana's lone congressman as secretary of the interior. So, G. and Forte ran in the special election just six months later. The night before the election, as I mentioned, he body slammed a reporter. But he still won that election and re-election to a full term in 2018. When Governor Bullock was term-limited, G. and Forte ran again in 2021. And unlike his last three races, he easily won. G. and Forte is a reliably conservative governor and promoted his ties with Donald Trump and his past campaign. He took office in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and focused on helping small businesses. He scrapped restrictions on businesses and social gatherings and later banned vaccine mandates. He's enacted several gun policies, notably banning law enforcement from enacting any gun restriction set by the Biden administration and signing a constitutional carry bill into law. He signed a bill banning transgender health care for minors, even though his non-binary son urged him not to. Interestingly, he signed a bill banning sanctuary cities, even though none existed in the state. He led Montana through historic flooding in the summer of 2022 and declared a state of emergency. He has put in big decisions on the budget for 2024, including millions of dollars to combat state hospital wait lists, and also cutting $23 million in state infrastructure fund. In addition, he's focused a lot on housing reform, which is something that's a particularly big issue in the state. Some saw him as a potential challenger to Democratic Senator John Tester in the 2024 election. But it appears more likely than not the new run for re-election to a second term.",subjective

They were installed in the mid 1820s and remained there until the capital was remodeled and expanded between 1958 and 1962. These unfluted Corinthian columns were put into storage until the 1980s when they were put on display here at the National Arbor Reedum. Now I'm in Rock Creek Park and a few steps off the trail you'll find a chain link fence with large piles of stones behind it. These stones were removed during the same renovation as the columns and placed here. You used to be able to walk amongst them but they recently installed the fence here to protect the stones. You can still see some of the intricate details carved into the stones. And here you can still see the white paint they used when they were part of the capital.",subjective

All the way up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. And the reason for this is because when you are an everyday investor or a billionaire like Trump, you take losses in order not to pay taxes. That's not illegal. That's just how taxes work. Even small businesses do it. This is not a new concept. You can investors as the main example, they will sell whatever they invest in, take a major loss in order to pay taxes that are so low that it doesn't hurt them or pay no taxes at all. For example, I know you can't see it, and I apologize, but in 2020 when Trump took a $4.7 million loss, he did not pay any federal income tax. There is nothing bad about that.

In 2016 and 2017, federal courts ruled that both of these maps were unconstitutional. They said what North Carolina Republicans did wasn't just gerrymandering. It was racial gerrymandering, done to deliberately dilute the political power of black people. The courts said the Republicans in the North Carolina State House now have to redraw the lines without looking at racial demographics. So, they went back to Tom Houghler. This time Houghler couldn't look at race. Instead, he looked at which area is voted for Democrats and which area is voted for Republicans. Instead of a racial gerrymander, it would be a partisan gerrymander. Here's that map using data from 2014. The bluer in area, the more Democratic voters there are. Now, if you zoom in here to Greensboro, you can see one of the highest concentrations of Democratic voters in the state. Houghler drew a congressional district line to crack this community in half. This meant Democrats here for now in the minority and their district. And Democrats here were also in the minority and their district. Houghler employed these techniques all over the state to create North Carolina's new political districts. And the first big test for these new maps would be the 2018 election. Democrats were expected to turn out in drove. Democrats are vying for a potential blue wave. The wave that Republicans fear is going to wipe them up. So, how do the maps do? For state representatives, Democrats got 51% of the vote. They only won 46% of seats. For state senate, they received half the vote and won just 42% of seats. And for Congress, you already know how that one turned out. Democrats won nearly half the votes, but won only three out of 13 seats. A year later in 2019, the Supreme Court weighed in. They said it was beyond their reach. That it wasn't their job to fix it. All of this raised an existential question. If Republicans could continue drawing the lines of stay in power, how could they ever be elected out of office? But the Supreme Court's ruling left open the possibility for state courts to rule on partisan gerrymandering. And in September 2019, that's exactly what North Carolina's Supreme Court did. The court found that partisan gerrymandering violated the state constitution. In the court's decision, it was Houghler's files that helped prove that North Carolina Republicans drew these lines with a clear intention of benefiting themselves. Ultimately, the court said North Carolina Republicans had to redraw the state house and state senate maps. One more time. This new map, approved by North Carolina legislators, is much less biased toward one party, even though it took some extreme measures and nearly a decade to force politicians to draw a fair map. In the last few years, the courts in several states, like Florida and Pennsylvania, have made partisan gerrymandering much harder. And now that's also the case in North Carolina. Houghler's gone now. But in other states across the country, many maps he helped draw are still in use. And while there's now a clear strategy to challenge those maps in state courts, many voters are still, effectively, not choosing their representatives. It's like Houghler said, the representatives are choosing the voters. Of course, redistricting is democracy at work. Redistricting is like an election in reverse. It's a great event.",subjective

Huh America? Well, if you said yes, you would be correct Yes, because that is what the demonic house of Biden is up to now Christians could be banned from fostering children under Joe Biden's new plans.

I have a little dyslexia anyway HHS Secretary Xavier whatever his last name is said this is going to change the complexion of how we view foster care treatment For our foster kids, but most importantly how we look at the people who we rely on to take care for foster kids Let's keep reading some more of this Fudgery shall we? However the attorney general's hit back saying that the proposed rule would harm children by limiting the number of available foster homes harm families by risking kinship placements and Harm states by increasing costs and decreasing care options sounds very logical to me They wrote these injuries will be suffered while HHS fails to solve a problem that the Proposed rule does not even prove exists in foster care In other words Joe Biden is speaking out of his behind He doesn't have any actual proof that this is happening to where he needs to push this new agenda Their letter also highlights that the foster care system depends on both individuals and Organizations of faith The latest data suggests that nearly 391,000 children were in foster care in 2022 and it will be estimated that 416,500 children will be in foster care by 2027 Without faith-based Organizations and foster homes the foster care system would face a critical lack of placement options the AGs wrote They added that the caring for children is in need is a duty of the Christian faith which it absolutely is this is literally Scriptural Marshall said since the first century Christians across the globe have answered to the call to provide a home and a family to children who had neither Alabama boasts a particularly strong faith-based foster care and adoption community and I will fight this administration for them every step of the way Congratulations America.

This division may seem daunting, but at its core, both sides are driven by intentions that aim to shape the nation's path. Conservatism, in its most positive light, acts as a guardian of the nation's cherished values and traditions. It's about safeguarding the principles that have guided generations, ensuring they remain untouched and preserved against the tide of rapid change. Those who lean towards conservatism focus on protection, emphasizing the need to hold onto the aspects of society that have stood the test of time successfully. On the flip side, progressivism thrives on the idea of improvement and evolution. It questions the status quo, asking critical questions about our current practices and seeking ways to address and rectify shortcomings. Progressivism is fueled by the desire to advance society, making it more equitable and just for all its members. It's a force for constructive change, pushing for reforms and innovations that promise a better future. The dynamic between conservatism and progressivism serves as a balancing act. Each ideology keeps the other in check, ensuring that the nation moves forward without losing sight of its foundational values. This balance is crucial in navigating the complexities of governance and societal progression. Understanding the intrinsic values and goals of both conservatism and progressivism can foster a more empathetic and productive political discourse. Recognizing that both camps are ultimately striving for what they believe is best for the country can be the first step towards bridging divides and working collectively towards common goals.  #politics #conservatism #progressivism #uspolitics #politicalbalance ",False,,mindvalley.daily,Mindvalley Daily,,,,,,False,Conservatism (US Politics),2021,@brent357475_video_7255027906055818538.txt, how Fivef Sheikhadan uwu,subjective

Let me tell you something, not one Republican member of our conference that I have spoken to has any idea what is in this foreign aid package that's going to give $60 billion to Ukraine. And that is even the leadership offices. They haven't heard from Mike Johnson on the details. We're reading about it in the news the same way the American people are, and it's outrageous. When you saw Zelensky right there on that interview talking about, oh, we're going to lose territory. Oh, we really need this money. This $60 billion should have been approved yesterday. Let me tell you, we are losing our country to the illegal invasion that's happening every single day at our southern border. And I am so pissed off about it because the American people are pissed off about it. And while our so-called Republican speaker of the house is only working with Chuck Schumer and Hawkeye Jeffries and Ukraine first, Mitch McConnell and the White House and Jake Sullivan who he talks to on the phone all the time, we are angry. And people have had it. We don't want $60 billion to go to Ukraine because as we slept last night, Tucker, we just went $40 billion more into debt. And that's because the interest in our debt is so huge and our debt is so massive. This is happening while we sleep every single night. So no, we don't want to send $60 billion to Ukraine. We want to put our country first. It's time to care about America. So, I mean, is it true? Do you think that the Republican speaker would bring this up at when your recess ends and get it passed without the majority of Republicans? But with Democrats, could that actually happen? Yeah. Yeah, because that's what he's planning to do. Here's what I've been told. Well, first off, let's go back, Tucker. The last vote that we had on any Ukraine funding was on September 28th of 2023. That was only months ago. And that vote only 101 Republicans voted yes for $300 million. $300 million to go to Ukraine. And that was because I pitched an enormous fit and said, take this money out of our Department of Defense. We should not be funding a foreign war in order to fund our military. That's completely wrong. And our military, their mission is stated on their website is to put our national security first. It's all about our national security. Fighting a proxy war with Russia in Ukraine, which is a non-NATO member nation, is not protecting America's national security interest. It doesn't protect the United States of America. As a matter of fact, that pushes us closer and closer to World War III. So, we had that vote on September 28th, 2023. 117 Republicans voted no. That was the majority of the majority. Every single Democrat voted yes. Every single one. They had zero Democrats vote no. Our Republican speaker of the House is planning to suspend the rules next week. He is planning to not put this bill through the Rules Committee. He's not going to allow us to do any amendments. Amendments are our way of changing a bill. Amendments are our way of putting our district's interest, who we represent. That's our job title, representative. It's our way of changing a bill. My Johnson is going to tie our hands behind our backs and not allow us to do that. As he brings that bill to the floor, every Democrat will vote for it. And a small portion of Republicans, less than the majority, will vote for it as well. And this isn't a Republican speaker we have right now. This is a Democrat speaker of the House, because there is zero daylight between what Nancy Pelosi did last Congress. And what Mike Johnson is doing now is our so-called Republican speaker of the House. It's just an amazing thing to see. Will he take a call from you? I'm planning to speak with him on Friday, and I'm very much looking forward to that. It's just interesting that he's talking and a lot of people in the media are talking. We haven't been able to talk to, but to Zelensky, who's a foreigner with his own interests, of course, but not an American. And certainly not, we hope a voter in this country. But all these people take calls from Zelensky and are swayed by him. Is it a little weird to see an American speaker of the House pay closer attention to a foreign leader or a number of different foreign leaders than he would to his own voters and colleagues in the House and our legislative body? Yeah, absolutely, especially considering Mike Johnson has completely changed his character in a matter of about five months after he has become speaker of the House. Johnson is a Christian. He called himself a conservative always has been. He's a Republican member. But yet here we are after the many best was passed just almost two weeks ago in Washington. And now with the $60 billion going to a war in Ukraine that Americans 70% of Americans do not support it. That's the most recent polling. 70% of Americans and the majority of our majority of Republicans do not support funding Ukraine. People want to see a peace deal in Ukraine, not murdering more Ukrainians and more Russians. This needs to end. But no, Mike Johnson has has made a complete departure of who he is and what he stands for. And to the point where people are literally asking, is he blackmailed? What is wrong with him? Because he's completely disconnected with what we want. Do you think he is being blackmailed? I have no idea.",subjective

However, a closer look reveals a more intricate tapestry, where the wiser segments of both sides play critical roles. It's reminiscent of two skilled attorneys in a courtroom, each one pushing and pulling, in an inherently constructive conflict that propels society forward. This kind of tension, rooted in the desire for progress and preservation, is fundamentally healthy. What's often overlooked is the existence of nuanced progressivism and conservatism, which, despite their frequent clashes, manage to work in tandem. Their disagreements are not signs of failure but indicators of a vibrant democratic process. Yet, beneath this sophisticated interplay lies a growing concern. The rise of more primitive-minded factions on both ends of the political spectrum threatens to overshadow the beneficial dialogue between the more enlightened conservatives and progressives. These crude forces, growing in power and influence, are creating an imbalance, shifting the focus away from productive discourse towards something more primal. The real story transcends the simple left-right dichotomy, highlighting a struggle between elevated political thought and its more basic counterparts. This expanding influence of ancient psychological tendencies within modern politics is a phenomenon that's reshaping the landscape, presenting challenges to the harmonious conflict that once moved us forward. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for navigating the complexities of contemporary political discourse. The emergence of this ancient psychology within the political realm is a pressing issue, potentially altering the very fabric of political engagement and decision-making. It begs the question of how we can foster an environment where the more refined forms of political thought can flourish, free from the intimidation and dominance of their primitive-minded versions.  #uspolitics #politicaldiscourse #progressivism #conservatism #politicaldynamics ",False,,mindvalley.daily,Mindvalley Daily,,,,,,False,Conservatism (US Politics),2021,@brutamerica_video_7080639182887996718.txt," 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 dollars go to administrative costs.

No. Does Medicare spend $23 million on executive pay like private insurance companies do? No. We know how much it costs to run a high-quality health insurance program. $1. Out of $100, research shows that Medicare spends 1.1% on administrative costs. We spend $4 trillion on health care every year. We could save $200 billion on administrative costs with Medicare for all. And those savings, they could go to expand Medicare. There's a cost to letting insurers paperwork, patients, and providers to death. And that cost of inaction is $200 billion on administrative costs. Now, administrative costs waste money, but they also waste health care workers' time. A recent study found that a majority of doctors, 56%, support a single-payer health care program. Why? Because today, doctors spend only one quarter of their time with patients. What are they doing with the rest of their time? Paperwork. Medicare for all would save a many on administrative costs, $200 billion a year. Medicare for all would give patients the most choices, 99% of non-pediatric providers. And Medicare would let doctors practice medicine. Not surprisingly, given these three things, what do we get with Medicare for all? Better health outcomes. And that's why I support Medicare for all.

This division may seem daunting, but at its core, both sides are driven by intentions that aim to shape the nation's path. Conservatism, in its most positive light, acts as a guardian of the nation's cherished values and traditions. It's about safeguarding the principles that have guided generations, ensuring they remain untouched and preserved against the tide of rapid change. Those who lean towards conservatism focus on protection, emphasizing the need to hold onto the aspects of society that have stood the test of time successfully. On the flip side, progressivism thrives on the idea of improvement and evolution. It questions the status quo, asking critical questions about our current practices and seeking ways to address and rectify shortcomings. Progressivism is fueled by the desire to advance society, making it more equitable and just for all its members. It's a force for constructive change, pushing for reforms and innovations that promise a better future. The dynamic between conservatism and progressivism serves as a balancing act. Each ideology keeps the other in check, ensuring that the nation moves forward without losing sight of its foundational values. This balance is crucial in navigating the complexities of governance and societal progression. Understanding the intrinsic values and goals of both conservatism and progressivism can foster a more empathetic and productive political discourse. Recognizing that both camps are ultimately striving for what they believe is best for the country can be the first step towards bridging divides and working collectively towards common goals.  #politics #conservatism #progressivism #uspolitics #politicalbalance ",False,,mindvalley.daily,Mindvalley Daily,,,,,,False,Conservatism (US Politics),2021,@buildingphotos_video_7208758954296479018.txt," It's just a cigarette and it cannot be that bad Honey, don't you love me, I didn't know it makes me sad It's just a cigarette like you always used to do I was different than I don't need them to be cold It's just a cigarette and it harms your pretty world Well, it's only twice a week so there's not much of a chance It's just a cigarette and it'll soon be only 10 Honey, can you trust me when I want to stop working?",subjective

It was that way across the South. Republican parties were started in the South by African Americans. In the state of Texas, two of our first three statewide Republican Chairman were African American. The first 42 black legislators elected in Texas were all Republican. The first 112 black legislators elected in Mississippi were all Republican. The first 190 black legislators elected in South Carolina were all Republican. The first 41 in Georgia, the first 127 in Louisiana. So now you've got all these African Americans really stepping up and starting to gain political standing, political power. Now you have Democrats on the other side who have been very racist. It's in their platforms. They support the Grudge Scott decision. They think the future of slave law is great. They started a nation to keep slavery alive, very racist. And so now they're facing a situation where that these blacks are now their rulers, are now in office, are now U.S. senators, are now U.S. How do you stop that? 1866 Democrats themselves started the Ku Klux Klan. Its purpose was not to kill blacks. Its purpose was to take control and return Democrats to power. Their stated purpose in the KKK was to stop Republicans and restore Democratic control. Now if you're looking for a Republican that you want to take care of, you can wipe out any black you want because there are 100% Republicans at that point in time. You can't wipe out any white. I mean some whites might be Democrats. You've got to be a little more judicious when you're wiping out whites. So what happens is the Ku Klux Klan starts attacking not blacks, Republican conventions, for example, in New Orleans, in the Republican convention in Louisiana. The Klan joined with the New Orleans police, joined with the New Orleans mayor, Democrats. They attacked physically at the convention in New Orleans, Republican convention. They killed 40 blacks, killed 20 whites, they wounded 150 others. 1868 they put out a push card in South Carolina and it listed what they call the radical members of the South Carolina legislature. Now push cards about the size of baseball card is put up by the Klan. Then put it out, it had the pictures of 63 legislators that needed to be wiped out in South Carolina. 50 of those legislators were black, 13 were white. Now they were all 63 Republican. On the back of the card, it gave you the name of each legislator so you know you're trying to kill. Congress starts these hearings on this group called the Klan and they have hearings and so they bring in Democrat leaders that under oath from these Democrat states that yes, the Klan belongs to our party. This actually in Congress, 1872 the hearings is a 13 volume set of hearings in Congress. Unequivocally Democrats say the Klan is ours and belongs to us. It's there to restore Democrat control in the Southern states. Those guys who lived through it made it very clear. For example one of the early black congressmen was John Roy Lynch. Another early black congressman was Richard Cain and they're having to fight the Klan physically for their own safety. They go armed to Congress because of the Klan attacks. These guys said if we as black would simply stop voting the Republican ticket. If we would agree to vote the straight Democrat ticket, all the violence against the Klan",subjective

Mr. Mayor, we do not have a country without a secure border. And we cannot have a safe country. We cannot protect our own democracy without protecting our elections. That is a fact. The open border is the number one issue across America and pull after pull. And that is exactly why this committee impeached you. Mr. Secretary, the oversight project released a bombshell report last night on your connection to the dark money in geo-industrial complex of illegal immigration. I know you saw this from one of my colleagues just earlier. They found flyers throughout the Resource Center, Matamoris, Refugee Camp in Mexico telling illegal aliens, reminder to vote for President Biden when you are in the United States. We need another four years of his term to stay open. I witnessed this saw the flyers also being handed out to migrants who were using RCM for assistance in coming to the United States. In an audio recording, the founder of RCM Gabby Zavala, by the way, we maybe should subpoena her to the committee, agreed that they need to help as many people as possible before President Trump gets reelected. RCM is an operation that houses functions for the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, which helps migrants in or the United States, and you're familiar with their work. We know that you served as a former board member of this group that funds illegal immigration. And they're very proud of you, Mr. Secretary. They congratulate you on your nomination. You worked as a board member of an NGO that is working in conjunction with other NGOs, which are not only financing the invasion of the country, but also telling illegal aliens to vote in the United States elections. They are telling illegal aliens, non-citizens, to come vote for Joe Biden. That's your boss. This is corruption at the deepest level. As a matter of fact, I would call it treason. It's treason because these people have declared war on our citizens by raping our women, our children, and murdering people. Like Lake in Riley, you're familiar with her, right? Congressman, our part breaking. Are you familiar with Lake in Riley? I am familiar with the case. You should have deported her so that she could be alive today. Her parents would have appreciated that. And also Kayla Hamilton, who was brutally raped and murdered by a cartel member. Her mother came and spoke to us. She didn't deport him either. You let him in the country. You, Mr. Secretary, have allowed over 10 million illegal, probably higher than that could be closer to 15 million. We don't know. To invade our country, you've allowed the cartels to make billions and billions. As a matter of fact, you're probably the best business partner they could ever have. They make all this money in human trafficking and drug trafficking in our border. You've allowed approximately 300 Americans to be murdered every single day from fentanyl that comes across our border. And now you're aiding NGOs to steal our elections through your budget. I demand proof of citizenship in our elections. And that is something every single member of Congress should care about. We don't need illegal aliens voting in our elections. We're supposed to be here talking about your budget, but we're talking about how money is being used to make sure people come into our country are able to get a social security number in which they can register to vote.

This division may seem daunting, but at its core, both sides are driven by intentions that aim to shape the nation's path. Conservatism, in its most positive light, acts as a guardian of the nation's cherished values and traditions. It's about safeguarding the principles that have guided generations, ensuring they remain untouched and preserved against the tide of rapid change. Those who lean towards conservatism focus on protection, emphasizing the need to hold onto the aspects of society that have stood the test of time successfully. On the flip side, progressivism thrives on the idea of improvement and evolution. It questions the status quo, asking critical questions about our current practices and seeking ways to address and rectify shortcomings. Progressivism is fueled by the desire to advance society, making it more equitable and just for all its members. It's a force for constructive change, pushing for reforms and innovations that promise a better future. The dynamic between conservatism and progressivism serves as a balancing act. Each ideology keeps the other in check, ensuring that the nation moves forward without losing sight of its foundational values.

After President Joe Biden announces 2024 campaign, the Republican National Committee released this ad made entirely with AI. The R&C video included fake news reports and suggested a dystopian future if Biden is re-elected. It's also the first major political ad to use AI-generated images, which can look and feel convincingly real to voters. I asked an AI expert about the risk of using this new technology in political messaging. You know, people complain about disinformation in the 2020 election. They haven't seen anything yet. 2024 is going to be a lot worse. There are a few ways to check whether an image is fake or real, like distorted backgrounds or body parts. But as the technology improves, it can become harder to distinguish real images from fake ones. The generative AI is getting a lot better at hands and necks. And so we're pretty much at the point where even real experts cannot distinguish the fake from the real. In political ads generated by AI are likely to become more common in the lead up to the 2024 election. Judges for many years have elevated political speech to a highly protected category. So even if somebody is saying something that is demonstrably false, the object of that statement could not sue for defamation.

In Congress, McCarthy has held several leadership positions. He served as Chief Deputy Whip from 2009 to 2011, House Majority Whip from 2011 to 2014, and House Majority Leader from 2014 to 2019. Following the retirement of Speaker Paul Ryan in 2019, McCarthy was elected as the House Minority Leader, a position he held until 2023. In January 2023, McCarthy was elected Speaker of the House. However, his tenure was short-lived, and he was ousted from the position later that year. Despite these challenges, McCarthy has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and continues to represent California's 23rd District.",objective

They're part of an ongoing investigation into the misinformation spread by the fossil fuel industry and this might be the biggest proof of their deliberate prevention of action on climate change yet. They didn't act alone either. Public relations firm Brunswick Group developed an advocacy plan for gas and methane. The campaign is right here and the goal is clear to risk the lives of all of us by advancing and protecting the will of gas and BP in the future of the energy conversation. Huge PR campaigns from major players like Shell focus entirely on clean energy development which don't really exist. Exxon plans only invest 10 to 12.5% of capital investments in lower carbon initiatives. Chevron is only committing to reduce 5% beyond operational emissions by 2028. BP and Shell claim they're going net zero while only spending 17 and 10% respectively on alternative energy. All the rest of those billions of dollars going right towards the expansion and acceleration of more emissions that are warming and destroying the planet. All major oil and gas companies are investing more in fossil fuels and are making inadequate climate pledges as they break in record of multi-billion dollar profits. At the same time they're pursuing a strategy of resisting and blocking climate regulations and only plan to cut emissions if it makes commercial sense. As the cherry on top they fought aggressively to hide the truth by not complying with subpoenas and attacking any journalist who reveals the truth about them. Despite all the ads and apparent plans to pursue and develop renewable energy sources their lives can be summarized in these documents with this sentence. Experts have found that not one of the net zero pledges from BP and Shell, Exxon or Chevron are aligned with the pace and scope of cuts necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and avert catastrophic climate change. Despite the best efforts of big oil and the American petroleum institute we now know without a doubt that they have no intention of adequately switching to renewable energy in any time frame close to what's required to secure a livable future.",subjective

However, a closer look reveals a more intricate tapestry, where the wiser segments of both sides play critical roles. It's reminiscent of two skilled attorneys in a courtroom, each one pushing and pulling, in an inherently constructive conflict that propels society forward. This kind of tension, rooted in the desire for progress and preservation, is fundamentally healthy. What's often overlooked is the existence of nuanced progressivism and conservatism, which, despite their frequent clashes, manage to work in tandem. Their disagreements are not signs of failure but indicators of a vibrant democratic process. Yet, beneath this sophisticated interplay lies a growing concern. The rise of more primitive-minded factions on both ends of the political spectrum threatens to overshadow the beneficial dialogue between the more enlightened conservatives and progressives. These crude forces, growing in power and influence, are creating an imbalance, shifting the focus away from productive discourse towards something more primal. The real story transcends the simple left-right dichotomy, highlighting a struggle between elevated political thought and its more basic counterparts. This expanding influence of ancient psychological tendencies within modern politics is a phenomenon that's reshaping the landscape, presenting challenges to the harmonious conflict that once moved us forward. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for navigating the complexities of contemporary political discourse. The emergence of this ancient psychology within the political realm is a pressing issue, potentially altering the very fabric of political engagement and decision-making.

This division may seem daunting, but at its core, both sides are driven by intentions that aim to shape the nation's path. Conservatism, in its most positive light, acts as a guardian of the nation's cherished values and traditions. It's about safeguarding the principles that have guided generations, ensuring they remain untouched and preserved against the tide of rapid change. Those who lean towards conservatism focus on protection, emphasizing the need to hold onto the aspects of society that have stood the test of time successfully. On the flip side, progressivism thrives on the idea of improvement and evolution. It questions the status quo, asking critical questions about our current practices and seeking ways to address and rectify shortcomings. Progressivism is fueled by the desire to advance society, making it more equitable and just for all its members. It's a force for constructive change, pushing for reforms and innovations that promise a better future. The dynamic between conservatism and progressivism serves as a balancing act. Each ideology keeps the other in check, ensuring that the nation moves forward without losing sight of its foundational values. This balance is crucial in navigating the complexities of governance and societal progression. Understanding the intrinsic values and goals of both conservatism and progressivism can foster a more empathetic and productive political discourse.

I mean, come on, folks, that is just crazy. You can sit here and try to lecture us about the leaks at Mar-Lago, which by the way, let me also state for the record for the American people. There have been no hearings, there have been no classified briefings about documents at Mar-Lago. So the members of Congress who were saying what they know, what they're talking about are leaks into the news media, which by the way are illegal leaks that are coming either a from the Department of Justice or be from the FBI. We don't know because the press reflects their sources. But if you're citing that, that is illegal information obtained by the press with active investigations. Let's go back to Hunter Biden. The chairman is the the the ranking member is correct. There are changes by Joe Biden to the ability for Congress to get suspicious activity reports. I am a recovering banker. When we issue suspicious activity reports, it's not just thrown out like a mere bag of shells. It's done for specific reasons because there are concerns about criminalities surrounding the financial transaction. If Hunter Biden and other members of the Biden family have more than a 100 suspicious activity reports, Congress does need to know about this because a funny thing's happening at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Joe Biden is president of the United States, his son, who's not a kid, by the way, the man's 50 years old, he and a kid, okay. His son is running around the world, cutting deals. His son is involved involved in suspicious activity reports where financial institutions are making that readily have that actually drafted those documents. And Congress doesn't want to know. We don't want to have oversight now. I find it interesting. I think it's very clear that the members of the majority party do have a playbook when it comes to smearing up political opponents.

Yes, there was a there was a military effects at the Department of State that led to the death of four members of four people at service, our country, and served our country. That did occur. And the one that we already know is occurring, not through conjecture, because the documents of the transactions are quite clear. Hunter Biden was readily involved in the transactions dealing with Chinese companies for a mineral that is critical to the Democrat agenda with respect to the Green New Deal.

It had nothing to do with building the wall, nothing to do with any catch or release, nothing to do with remain in Mexico, with all respect, Mr. Secretary. That answer is laughable.

I can't believe this is real, it's real. This is the Republican Attorney General of Texas, his name is Ken Paxton, although he is not currently serving as Attorney General because he has been suspended from office by the Texas legislature pending an impeachment trial. Now how bad do things have to be for the Republicans in the Texas legislature to impeach their own Republican Attorney General? Well, where do we start? Almost the entire time he's been Attorney General, he's been under indictment for felony securities fraud. Meanwhile he's facing potential disbarment from the practice of law entirely over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Also he's under criminal investigation by the U.S. Justice Department on serious corruption allegations. Allegations so serious that eight high ranking officials in his own office went to the FBI to report what they had witnessed in his office. Earlier this year, Paxton reached a multi-million dollar settlement in a lawsuit for allegedly firing several of those officials as retaliation for them going to the FBI. It has been a lot with this guy, but hilariously it was only when Paxton demanded that Texas taxpayers fork over the millions of dollars to pay that settlement that Republicans in the legislature finally started to get a little bit cranky with him. The Texas House impeached Ken Paxton by an overwhelming margin. So that means the Texas Senate now has to put him on trial. They'll hold an impeachment trial in September. If he's convicted at that Senate impeachment trial, he will lose his job permanently. Now here's where it gets amazing. That trial will be presided over by the president of the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor of the State, a man named Dan Patrick. As the presiding judge overseeing Paxton's impeachment trial, he'll have immense power. He'll be the ultimate arbiter of the rules and the admissibility of evidence and all that stuff. Here's the thing I can't believe is real, but it is. So Dan Patrick, the guy who's the presiding judge in this impeachment trial, just had to release his new campaign finance report. And would you look at that? He just received three million dollars from the Ken Paxton Superback. Wow, what a coincidence. Dan Patrick isn't even up for reelection until 2026. All he has coming up is this impeachment trial that he has to run in a few weeks. And here's the pack for the defendant in that impeachment trial dumping three million dollars on his porch just ahead of the trial. Wow, everything is bigger in Texas. Amazing.",subjective

Earlier this month, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the federal agencies, including the FBI and DHS, likely violated the First Amendment. In fact, the judge said it was one of the worst, if not the worst, violation of the First Amendment in the history in our American history. Our federal government is still undertaking many of the same tactics to be unworthy of democracy, and occasionally reminiscent of totalitarian regimes. Today, it was revealed on Capitol Hill and news you aren't supposed to know that, indeed, we are being censored, and our freedom of speech has been violated countless times. The FBI continues to misuse its authority under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Survey Lens Act. You would think we'd be going after foreigners, but we are using the Foreign Intelligence Survey Lens Act to go after Americans. It's also revealed that, as we suspected, the government has an approved message, even when that message is false. You are to know. And if anything differs from that government-approved message, even if it's untrue, it could be taken down and countless were investigated illegally. We're targeted and surveilled for contradicting the approved government initiative. And narrative. Think we're safe from creeping dictatorship or to totalitarianism? We'll think again. Worsing social media companies to remove speech, the government disagreed with FBI and DHS, regularly met with social media companies and pressured them to remove content, it deemed as misinformation, including posts and accounts that originated from within the United States, and including posts and accounts that are verifiably true. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that federal agencies, including the FBI, have likely trampled on the First Amendment. The judge general back either calling it potentially the most severe First Amendment violation and US history. The scariest part is that there is no checks and balances because the government has no incentive to do anything because they are the ones who want your narrative to be controlled. Intelligence agencies use their powers to serve ideological purposes attempting to covertly influence social policy and political action. Senator Rand Paul pulls the veil of a dark troop. The government distorted and exaggerated facts, leveraged mass media and attacked the leadership of groups it considered to be threats to the social order. And a recent investigation has uncovered decades of abuse by federal intelligence agencies against ordinary Americans. Even groups like the NAACP to women's liberation groups, anyone opposing the government's approved narrative faced surveillance and intimidation. Revealing decades of widespread abuse by federal intelligence agencies against US citizens. It's chilling. The government has scripted message in anyone that deviates from it, even with the truth, is silenced. And the censorship of the Constitution, a constitutionally protected speech on social media, is just one example of actions in recent years weaponizing the federal government against its people. Protect our rights and follow me for more on this and other news that isn't approved to be revealed that you need to know.",subjective

Of course, which miles go told us in 10,000 years they've never created a vaccine, but they could definitely create one here in six months after there was after quote unquote the Wuhan lab leak. To what Frank Gaffey said, a senior member of the Canadian military wants a like military tribunal in Canada to get to the bottom of what happened in the military games and Canadian military athletes got sick in September and October of 2019. It ain't called COVID-19 for nothing, ladies and gentlemen. All the chickens are coming home to roost on Fauci and all these liars and even worse than liars. And now they're partners. Let's say they are the partners of the transnational criminal organization that is the Chinese Communist Party. All of this, I saw a statistic today. We have spent more money on the Wuhan CCP virus than collectively to get us out of the Great Depression and the Second World War to defeat fascism in the imperial military hunta. Military hunta at a Japan more cash money. And you wonder why the United States dollars being divided you want to understand why inflation is on fire. You understand why your economic life is about to be destroyed. We're on the edge of an abyss. This abyss you wait to think and all these guys who put his in business put your pension fund money in business with the Chinese Communist Party and all these investments in particularly real estate. You watch that goes down the drain because ladies and gentlemen it's going as sure as the turning of the earth. And right now these demons and these devils that have inflicted this on the Chinese people allowed by Zhing. Now have something something wicked this way comes right out of China from the CCP and it's at their biggest cities and they can't tamp it down. The port city is bigger than I think the three biggest ports in the United States combined biggest act of industrial port in the world. These cities are massive in scale. They dwarf New York City. Want to go to Frank back to Frank get we're going to get Ben Harren we'll back in here. We got Dr Malone Tony lions it we're jammed up today with news and information from around the world that's going to impact your life. Frank you've got you know all you got MSNBC you know sitting there with Richard Maddow and Ari Melver and joy and read and Chris Hayes and tire crowd that says all the the Trump supporters of the worst of the world these are cretans these are fascists. They're supporting a criminal organization that is crimes against humanity and killed more of their own people than any nation or earth and as far worse than Hitler was in 1936 as bad as that devil was and to and signal to us everything was coming. These guys are in the operation of doing it live organ harvesting concentration camps across the board and yet the mainstream media is cow talon to them all the big woke corporations are cow talon to them. And now they've got a virus that's out of control in China and now finally after two and a half weeks of the war room pounding again like we didn't move on back in January of 2020 the financial times bases says hey there may be a problem here. And one of the problems is hey they already jabbed everybody force vaccinations of 1.2 billion people and guess what you have a whole nation sick Frank F. and he tells about the letter the committee on the present danger is putting forward right now.",subjective

Because he's a criminal fraud. And some of you are like, well, there's 49 other states. That's not how interstate business works and that's certainly not how interstate banking and getting loans work and Trump's business thing was always based on borrowing money and carrying debt. And that was actually the crux of the fraud. Trump would always claim a super inflated value and then borrow against those assets. But then when it came time to pay tax on him, he would declare a super low value. So which isn't? Is it worth a lot of money or is it worth no money? He claimed Mar-a-Lago was worth $1.5 billion with a B. But when it came to tax time, it was only worth $50 million. He can forget about doing anything like Trump stakes or Trump airlines again.

Senator, to you come to the camera. Okay, very quickly. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Not to interrupt the conversation that you were having, but did anything that you learned in there has changed your perspective on Ukraine? No. You've been pretty out there. No, no, it did not. Listen. What I heard in there, let me just, you know, choose my words carefully given the, it was a request by briefing, but I'll just say this, I mean, if there's a path, if there's some path to victory in Ukraine, I didn't hear it today. And I also heard that there was going to be no end to the funding request. So I think this lays for quest for what is a 24 billion. That is not the end. They made that very clear. It's not close to the end. So I would just say what we're basically told is buckle up and get out your checkbook. Of course, it's not our checkbook. And can I just say, by the way, I'm sick and tired of hearing all of these people in that room for the administration applaud Congress for being so generous. This isn't our money. For heaven's sake, it's not our, we're not being generous. It's the American people's money. And they spent 115 billion of it. And so far they have basically nothing to show for it. And they're going to ask for a heck of a lot more. 24 billion is not the end. Not even close to the end. So what happens if Congress doesn't help pamphlet what they do? Well, hopefully number one, our European allies will actually do something. And they just confirm to us again that we have spent more than all of Europe combined. I mean, last I looked, Russia was in Europe. So we need our European allies to step up to the plate here in Germany in particular. We can start with them and do more. But that's not the message they're sending. The message they're sending is American and the American people are on the hook indefinitely. So let's have no more applause for Congress spending other people's money. They should go to the American people in this level of them and say we want 50, 100 billion more. Maybe more than that. So you could tell the Republicans they're saying that essentially we've drawn the assistance we're getting to Ukraine. Would amount to worse than what happened when the Biden administration withdrew to Afghanistan. What's your response in Paris? You know, here's what I think you could do. And let's listen to all, take all these comments about what would happen if we didn't keep spending the American people's money. Take out Ukraine, insert Iraq or insert Afghanistan. And you would get exactly what George W. Bush said for years. And other people after him about why we have to stay indefinitely in those countries and keep spending money indefinitely with no oversight, by the way. And at the end of the day, very little to show for it. It's the same recycled arguments. I don't know why we have to go through this again. I'm actually a little bit of a rough guy. Wow, the arguments aren't any different. It's the same argument over and over. Listen, I just listen to them say, for our standing in the world, we must keep spending this money. Literally, for our standing in the world. I mean, that's now what we're spending money on for our standing in the world. Do you play to a Mark Kelly mentioned that a pen impact today that after the war is over, there may be a need for a Marshall plan ask. You know, spending to rebuild the country. What do you make of that? Oh, yeah, that'll be next. We're talking about this, what I mean. They want 24 billion now. Many, many, many, many more billions over the next year. They just said that. And then they'll want on top of that. Who knows how much? Now listen, here's what I did today. I just stood out on the steps of the Capitol today with people from my state and around the country who are exposed to nuclear radiation by the federal government. And they haven't gotten a penny from their government. Not a penny for 70 years. And you want me to go spend their money, hugger billion more dollars on Ukraine. And they can't even get basic health care because they've been poisoned by their government with military operations. That furies me. Are you sensitive to all that pulling out of Ukraine? Bling a to away from Ukraine? Send a bad message to China? To President Xi? No, I think the message that we need to send, listen. The way to deter China is to deter China. And you have to do that in the Pacific. Ukraine is not in the Pacific. So our number one national security threat is China. Right now we are out of position. If China invades Taiwan tomorrow, we are not in a position to stop it. And I think we've got to tell the truth, America people. If they invade Taiwan, Taiwan falls. I mean, that's just, so if you're not concerned about that, then that's fine. But I am. Do you plan to attend Zelensky's meeting with Senators? I doubt it. Although after what I heard today, I'm thinking maybe I should, just because I was so surprised by what I just heard in there about the state of the effort that I thought, you know, maybe I should hear this directly from Zelensky. Because what I heard I was alarming. So you want to hear from him the staff? Staying in the war effort. I was surprised by what I heard in there about where it is. Do you have any questions for him? Well, I mean, on this side, I'd, I'll bet the progress. I mean, it was, that was a little different tune that was something to us there than I heard some in public. And it was an alarming one for I was to say without saying any more. Senator Oli, you know, Mitch McConnell is our unit that we've got a lot for money. That most of this money has gone to weapons manufacturing in the United States. No, it's trading contractors. Upgrading our own factories, modernizing them, restocking our own arms. That we gave them some of our older weapons. And that's actually going to help us and help our own military and provide jobs for Americans. At the same time, he points to Russia's military being degraded on the cheek. Because we've spent billions of dollars to counter the Russian military. For like a hundred billions, we've really helped Ukraine destroy a lot of Russian military equipment and capacity. And he also says, you know, Ukraine is free. That's a big deal. Well, you've, the last I looked, you've Korean had a whole bunch of Russian troops in their territory. So we've spent $113 billion that is not cheap of the American people's money. And frankly, the idea that the, I'm sure the military contractors are loving this. Oh, no doubt they are. They're making gobs of money. Is that equaling new American jobs? I'd love to see that analysis. I haven't heard any actual numbers. I've heard a lot of happy talk about it. I've also heard from the same people that spending a money in Ukraine is deterring China. I mean, these folks, if they want, they need to make the case for Ukraine. If they have a strategy to win, let's hear it. If they have a strategy actually in this conflict, let's hear it. But let's not have any more, frankly, misleading comments. Let's not lie to the American people about what we're doing and where we are. Let's not tell them we're winning when we are not. Let's not tell them that Ukraine is winning when it's not. Let's not tell them we're ready to stop China when we are not. They lied to us about Iraq. They lied to us about Afghanistan. I'm frankly tired of having them actively mislead us about Ukraine. I mean, this should stop. These people should stop. Do you think that the nation tried to provide the equipment to drive Russia, or forces entirely out of the grain? No, should we? No. Absolutely not. No. No, we should not. I'm totally opposed to putting American troops on the ground. They say they are. No. No. No, I think we should. No, we spent 115 billion, what we ought to be doing is getting our force posture where it needs to be in the Pacific, vis-a-vis China, where we are badly out of position. The other argument that's made, including by Mark Kelly, that came back to Ukraine is sort of a domino effect argument. That is right. That if you, if we pull out of Ukraine, like Vietnam, that they would then be on the doorstep of Poland, to go up and let the wania and all these other satellite states that you should be part of the Soviet Union. Well, wait, you just said a second ago that their military is significantly degraded. So how are they going to, it's one of the other, right? Other than the military is degraded, and they're not in position to do that, or they're about to overrun all of Europe. It's not both. So, I mean, I think you should put that question to the folks who say that. I mean, is their military, is it a roaring tiger? Is it degraded? I mean, it's one of the other. So, the truth is that the argument always shifts to whatever is at hand to get us to spend more of the American people's money without any strategy for victory, and that's what I just heard down there today. So, listen, I hope I'm wrong, but I better let you guys go. Are you saying based on what you heard today that the American public is being lied to on Ukraine? I think when you tell the American public that things are going well in Ukraine, that is not the truth. I think when you tell them we're in position in China where we need to be, that is not the truth. When you tell them that doing what we're doing in Ukraine is helping with the China fight, that is not the truth. So, I just think you should wish the truth, and that is not the truth. All right, thanks guys. Thank you. Thanks for the update.",subjective

Mississippi has banned abortion. There is no abortion clinic left in Mississippi. So if you live in Mississippi and you need to get an abortion, you will need to figure out how to get yourself out of Mississippi and into a state where you can legally get one. But the Republicans in state government in Mississippi say they will effectively follow you out of the state. By virtue of the fact that you are a Mississippi resident, sorry, they now claim the right to seize your medical records from like a clinic in New York or in Illinois or wherever else you go. They claim the right to follow you there and take your private medical records from there for their own law enforcement purposes. And I just showed you headlines from Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Georgia. But it is actually 19 different states where Republican officials are going for this now. 19 Republican Attorney Generals in 19 states have signed on to a letter to the Biden administration saying they want the right to go after women's private medical records anywhere in the country, all the states where abortion is legal. They want to follow their residents all over the country to see if that woman might be getting an abortion or some other kind of reproductive care anywhere. They want the records and they claim the right to go get them. Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Republican attorneys general in all of those states have sent this letter to the Biden administration about their right as they see it to get your private medical records. And they mean it for women getting an abortion or potentially fertility treatment or any kind of reproductive care, potentially contraception. And yes, also gender affirming care of any kind. They claim the right to go take your private medical records to see what you're up to with that kind of care, no matter where you have gone to get it.",subjective

Despite everything that you're hearing in the news, we are witnessing a huge right-word shift in American politics and ideology. And something like this doesn't happen quick. This is something that will take a decade or decades to fully manifest. The root of the matter is that our Supreme Court is more conservative than it's been in 90 years. They have a 6-3 conservative majority. Some of the most notable rulings were the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the severe curtailing of affirmative action. And conservatives have clearly targeted women's rights in order to achieve their aims. Clearly, the overturning of Roe v. Wade is a violation of women's rights. I don't need to explain that to you. But most people think that affirmative action only benefits minorities while it has benefited women tremendously in our history. Let me correct that actually. It's white women. White women have benefited tremendously in affirmative action more than any other minority. Which is pretty crazy because some of the largest arguments against affirmative action have come from white women. And there's something much more in cities going on with the GOP trying to take apart women's rights by pushing the LGBTQ issue. Conservative politicians were never concerned about the LGBTQ community attacking anyone in bathrooms. Since conservatives seem to do that more. Conservatives put up a straw man, attacked that straw man, that LGBTQ community went against those attacks. And now we have the issues that we have. The middle has been clearly spooked by the left. And now they are shifting right. And they are going to vote in a whole bunch of conservative local and state politicians. I don't think Trump will get reelected though. The fact that the three heads of the top universities in the world could not condemn calls for Jewish genocide is the straw that broke the camel's back for a lot of the middle. On this particular issue, any college that supports this kind of mentality will never see a penny of my money. Now I've already mentioned a conservative majority in the Supreme Court. With the district courts we have 91 of them. There is still a majority held by the Democrats. But the federal circuit courts also have a conservative majority. And something like this always happens whenever there's some kind of major event that affects America like COVID. Same thing happened after the Civil War and Reconstruction. We had a huge rightward shift. Same thing happened after the gilded age. But when things got really bad, like the Great Depression and then World War II there was a huge progressive shift. Things got so bad in this country that our leaders were worried about a communist revolution so they actually started implementing policy that favored labor. And that progressive shift lasted until the Civil Rights era. Of course 1980 Ronald Reagan gets elected and boom! A huge conservative shift happens in this country again. And it really doesn't end until the middle of the 2000s. And it's not always a president or congressman getting elected that determines the left or the rightward shift that this country goes through. Generally it's the steering of American law. And right now with the 63 conservative majority in the Supreme Court and everything else that's going on, it does look like it's heading in a rightward direction. And that rightward direction means the erosion of women's rights. I'm not saying women are going to lose their right to vote or even their right to work, but they are going to lose a lot of protections as a result of this. This is also going to affect unions, any other minority, employees, labor in general. Teachers' rights are going to be infringed upon especially with the whole teaching creationism in science class. In my personal opinion, it's a step back for the American people.",subjective

Every single year they conduct their annual values and belief survey. And the latest addition shows that American support for social conservatism is at a decade high. It is increasing among all demographics. According to the poll, 38% of Americans now identify as socially conservative. In comparison to 29% who identify as socially liberal. This is the highest percentage in the poll that have identified as socially conservative since 2012. The poll also showed that the percentage of 18 to 29 year olds, people who largely make up Gen Z, identifying a socially conservative increased by 6 percentage points between 2021 and 2023. And Americans ages 30 to 49 years old shifted socially conservative by 13 points since 2021. It showed that Republicans and Independents all became more conservative in the last two years. While registered Democrats largely stayed the same. It also showed that the percentage of Americans who identify as fiscally conservative is now at 44%. Nearly half of the survey said that they are conservative on economic issues. So what exactly does all of this mean? Well for starters, it means that there is a genuine negative reaction to social leftism in this country. People it turns out don't like the rainbow mafia being shoved down their throats. They think it's wrong for kids to go through sex changes. It's wrong for men to play women's sports. People don't want pornography or LGBT propaganda in their schools. It shows that people in this country still hold traditional values dear. And that all of these are incredibly popular issues for Republicans to lean into. The other thing it shows is that when thing one and thing two here say that Gen Z is going to deliver an overwhelming Democrat victory, that's not really entirely true. Sure, in 2020 and in 2022 the Democrat Party received overwhelming support from Gen Z voters. But this is not necessarily because the Democrat Party has better ideas. It's because they are a lot better than Republicans at driving out younger voters. Something the GOP needs to get their shit together about. In addition, ever since millennials voted overwhelmingly for Barack Obama in 2008, their voting trends have shifted hard to the right. The 2020 election millennial voters backed Joe Biden by a percentage of 55 to 43. This is half of the margins that Obama got 12 years earlier. 2020 exit polls showed that Joe Biden won by just six points among voters who were 18 to 27 in 2008. During the 2022 midterm, those same voters only backed Democrats by 10 points. So no, the Democrat Party does not own younger voters. And they are in fact getting more ideologically conservative. Now all the Republican Party has to do is translate that into electoral success, by running on a positive and inspiring agenda for the country. To work to drive out younger voters in the same way that the Democrat Party does very well. But don't underestimate the GOP's ability to fuck things up.",subjective

In order to stop him from running again in 2024, let me ask you a question. How much do you think Mar-a-Lago is worth? Mar-a-Lago, obviously, Donald Trump's home golf club, resort in West Palm Beach, Florida? I mean, look at this thing. How much do you think it would cost on Zillow? Well, according to a New York judge, the answer to that question is $18 million. So keep in mind, the combined cost when Donald Trump bought Mar-a-Lago in 1985 was $20 million. But this judge ruled that the Trump Organization committed fraud by undervaluing Mar-a-Lago and completely revoked the Trump Organization's business license in the state. This, by the way, all stems from a civil lawsuit that was filed against the Trump Organization by New York Attorney General Latisha James, who literally ran for the office promising to go after the Trumps. She literally promised to search for a crime against the leading political opponent of her party. Textbook weaponization of the legal system. Now, she spent years investigating them and she could never find an actual crime because there was none. So she had to file a civil suit against them. And there was also not even a trial in this civil suit. There were no hearings, no evidence presented, no cross-examination, not even a jury. But this Supreme Court justice Arthur and Goran just made this ruling. Just decided on a whim that Mar-a-Lago is only worth $18 million. Keep in mind, you can get a blank slate of land in West Palm Beach for $200 million. They have listings in Palm Beach that are just trees for $150 million. Rush Limbaugh's widow sold their Palm Beach mansion, which is much smaller than Mar-a-Lago, for $155 million. This is completely insane weaponization of the legal system. But liberals don't care. They're perfectly happy with it. They're cheering it on.

They don't want to give money to the Republican National Committee if Trump is going to be the winner. They don't like Trump. They don't like Trump. They don't like Trump. So Governor DeSantis was their fairhead boy until the furor started going down the toilet. And you have DeSantis now showing that he is a dud. And so they stopped giving Monty for DeSantis. Because they didn't think he's going to win. And the other back will let Trump go to the winner. They don't want to help Trump because they don't like Trump. So then their next fairhead boy was Tim Scott. So they started falling in love with Tim Scott. And then recently there have been several articles published in different publications. They are beginning to say, oh, wait a minute. Tim Scott is not married. Why is Tim Scott not married? Could it be that Tim Scott is in the closet? So now they don't want to give money to Tim Scott because he's not married to a woman. And they're worried about his preferences in life. And I don't know what they are. Whether he's single or he want to be single. He's gay. He's straight. Whatever. I have no idea. It's not, you know, I could care less. He could be whatever he wants to be. It doesn't bother me. But now they're afraid to give to him because they're concerned that he's not married to a woman. So they stop giving. All right. So where else do you get money from? Where do you get money from the middle and the little people? Well, they've never done well with these people. They've never done well with the little people. And guess who's sucking up all the little money? All the little red people are given to Trump. Trump is like a vacuum cleaner. Well, his legal bills, you know, suppose he's going to campaign, but it's paying his legal stuff. I thought Trump had all those billions. Baby, you ain't got no money. You don't have any money. Otherwise, why do you need their money? You don't. That's just it. So they're giving money. So the Republican National Committee has $11.8 million in the bank because nobody wants to give money to them because they're afraid of who the candidate's going to be. So I just find that quite interesting. And I'll have to Google to see about how the Democratic National Committee stands. But I have a feeling they got more than 11.8 million in the bank. But good luck. Good luck running an National Campaign running for the governors that are up.

We covered Tennessee's Republican Attorney General seizing the private medical records of trans people in that state. Well, here's the lead in a breaking news story in the Tennessee and newspaper tonight. Tennessee's Attorney General wants the state to be able to investigate and compel information on out-of-state abortions. These are your private medical records. They are taking them already from trans people in Tennessee. Now they want to take them from any Tennessee woman who has had an abortion in another state. In another state, yeah, if you live in Tennessee and you need to get an abortion, well, Republicans have instituted an abortion ban in Tennessee. So you can't get one in Tennessee anymore. You will need to travel out of state. But Tennessee's Republican Attorney General now says he intends to effectively follow you out of state to get your medical records to see if you got an abortion somewhere else, even in the state where it's legal. That's the Tennessee in tonight. And oh, look, it's also in Kentucky. Tonight in the Louisville Courier Journal, the Kentucky Attorney General wants Kentuckians out of state abortion records to be available to authorities. Oh, it's not just Tennessee. It's also Kentucky. Oh, and look, here it is in Arkansas, too, today in the Arkansas Times. Arkansas Attorney General wants to know about your out of state abortion. It's happening with the Republican Attorney General in Arkansas, too. Oh, and look, here tonight, here it is in Georgia, Georgia Attorney General, and here it is in Mississippi, Mississippi's Attorney General. This is from Mississippi today, a nonprofit news organization, which was actually first to break this story with this headline. Mississippi's Attorney General wants to make info on out of state abortions available to Mississippi authorities. Mississippi has banned abortion. There is no abortion clinic left in Mississippi. So if you live in Mississippi and you need to get an abortion, you will need to figure out how to get yourself out of Mississippi and into a state where you can legally get one. But the Republicans and state government in Mississippi say they will effectively follow you out of the state. I virtue of the fact that you are a Mississippi resident. Sorry. They now claim the right to seize your medical records from like a clinic in New York or in Illinois or wherever else you go. They claim the right to follow you there and take your private medical records from there for their own law enforcement purposes. And I just showed you headlines from Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Georgia, but it is actually 19 different states where Republican officials are going for this now. 19 Republican Attorney Generals in 19 states have signed on",subjective

A.G. Kobach has said, quote, failing to disclose when a child is socially transitioning or identifying as non-binary at school violates a parent's rights. I want to zero in here on the fact that he said socially transition. We're not talking about medical intervention at this point. We're not talking about them taking hormones or puberty blockers or anything like that. We are purely talking about them using maybe a different name, maybe a different pronouns. And I gotta think that if a student is not telling their parent about their gender identity, there's probably a good reason for that. And the fact that he wants the state to intervene in four schools to out their kids is only going to harm trans and non-binary students. That's the point. It's also the fact that he said, schools should not socially transition students. As if schools are the ones who are facilitating the social transition and not the fact that like you said, kids are using school as a safe place to express themselves when their parents may be violent or abusive. Schools are not socially transitioning your children. Your children may decide to undergo social transition at school. And the school is kind of just a banal factor in that.

History is listed with examples of where people have tried to fix a society and they've simply broken it. They've made it way, way worse. Like look at any revolution in history you want to look at.

I would recommend that you all read the two reports that were produced by the Ways and Means Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation. For all practical purposes, the research that was done as it relates to the mandatory audit program was non-existent. The tax forms were really never audited and only my sending a letter at one point prompted sort of a rearview mirror response. I emphasize again that the mandatory program has highlighted in what you will likely get in the next few minutes or so. It was almost non-existent. And my point is that that was the legislative purpose with which we won four federal court decisions in three courts. We argued for an examination of how the audit process played out. Once staff went to visit the IRS and once staff had a chance to go to some of the other locations that are within the jurisdiction of the IRS, they quickly concluded that in fact the audit did not occur. There were no audits in a timely manner. That goes I think for 2017, 2018 and 2019. As I noted, we made it through those substantial court decisions. It required patience. Let me say something because I think it appears a personal note. This was never about being punitive. It was never about being malicious. I never over promised. I never built an unreasonable level of expectation. And time it again, I refrained from the questions in the hallway that you posed to me because I was not about to upset a very sensitive court case. The other thing that happened much to your dislike was that there were no leaks that occurred from the committee. We kept this very much above board, went back and forth with the attorneys at the committee. And we were determined to put forward a case that would, as I noted early on when I was asked in the hallway right after my letter originally was sent, I was asked what do you expect? And I said a long and grueling court case. That was my quote three and a half years ago. That's what happened. Did we have enough time to conduct the review? Yes, we did. These were individuals on the tax staff who were seasoned professionals, tax lawyers and accountants. They proceeded as I knew they would with not only great professionalism, but also with great restraint. Not to overdo anything as they undertook their responsibilities. When Republicans argue, and I want to hear from the others here, when Republicans argue that there was no precedent. There is a letter from Richard Nixon on December 13th of 1973 to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Wilbur Mills. And he asked Wilbur Mills to have the joint committee on taxation review as tax returns. It began that very day. This idea that this never happened before, well, 49 years ago, it did happen.",subjective

Well, here's the lead in a breaking news story in the Tennessee and newspaper tonight. Tennessee's Attorney General wants the state to be able to investigate and compel information on out-of-state abortions. These are your private medical records. They are taking them already from trans people in Tennessee. Now they want to take them from any Tennessee woman who has had an abortion in another state. In another state, yeah, if you live in Tennessee and you need to get an abortion, well, Republicans have instituted an abortion ban in Tennessee. So you can't get one in Tennessee anymore. You will need to travel out of state, but Tennessee's Republican Attorney General now says he intends to effectively follow you out of state to get your medical records to see if you got an abortion somewhere else, even in the state where it's legal. That's the Tennessee in tonight. And oh, look, it's also in Kentucky. Tonight in the Louisville Courier Journal, the Kentucky Attorney General wants Kentuckian's out-of-state abortion records to be available to authorities. Oh, it's not just Tennessee. It's also Kentucky. Oh, and look, here it is in Arkansas, too, today in the Arkansas Times. Arkansas Attorney General wants to know about your out-of-state abortion.

Mississippi's Attorney General. This is from Mississippi today, a nonprofit news organization, which was actually first to break this story with this headline, Mississippi's Attorney General wants to make info on out-of-state abortions available to Mississippi authorities. Mississippi has banned abortion. There is no abortion clinic left in Mississippi. So if you live in Mississippi and you need to get an abortion, you will need to figure out how to get yourself out of Mississippi and into a state where you can legally get one. But the Republicans in state government in Mississippi say they will effectively follow you out of the state. By virtue of the fact that you are a Mississippi resident, sorry, they now claim the right to seize your medical records from like a clinic in New York or an Illinois or wherever else you go. They claim the right to follow you there and take your private medical records from there for their own law enforcement purposes. And I just showed you headlines from Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Georgia. But it is actually 19 different states where Republican officials are going for this now. 19 Republican Attorney Generals in 19 states have signed on to a letter to the Biden administration saying they want the right to go after women's private medical records anywhere in the country, include all the states where abortion is legal. They want to follow their residents all over the country to see if that woman might be getting an abortion or some other kind of reproductive care anywhere. They want the records and they claim the right to go get them. Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Republican attorneys general in all of those states have sent this letter to the Biden administration about their right as they see it to get your private medical records. And they mean it for women getting an abortion or potentially fertility treatment or any kind of reproductive care, potentially contraception. And yes, also gender affirming care of any kind. They claim the right to go take your private medical records to see what you're up to with that kind of care, no matter where you have gone to get it.",subjective

We're not getting cooperation from your agency. And then I gave them a couple examples. There's two areas that the American public can get information out of the government. One is FOIA requests. And unfortunately, that often has to go through a court and have that be court ordered, although it shouldn't be. And then through congressional oversight, right? So I have two examples of both. This was a document. These are the famous anti-fouche emails. OK. Through a FOIA request, people got them early. And what we did is, shortly after, we had five members of this committee. There's actually a law. Five USC 2954 that says, if five members of this committee request information, the government shall provide it. So under that statute, we wrote the letter, we got this document. OK. This is dated February 4th. The classification here is the exception 4, is why it's redacted. And that has to do with trade secrets or confidential, commercial, or financial information. This is the same document recently produced under FOIA to the general public. It's not redacted. So now I know what's under the redactions. Cereo passage in ACE2 transgenic mice. But that's what was covered up. This is Anthony Fauci with question marks going. This is in February 4th. He's already recognized that maybe the claim from a lab, from experiments with those humanized mice. That was denied Congress in our oversight capability. A couple days earlier, similar type of thing. This is what we got in congressional oversight, all redacted. This is what was obtained under FOIA request. So again, we can see under the redactions now. And again, not because the agency gave it to us, because the court ordered it. It's interesting. This is classified under exception number five, which is deliberative process, inter or intraagency communications. What's interesting about this email chain, it includes Jeremy Ferraro of the welcome trust. He doesn't work for US government agencies. So you've already blown the privilege in terms of confidentiality. So again, they're not following the law. Through the accommodation process, we ask for all 4,000 pages. We narrowed it down to 400. They wouldn't give them to us. They allowed us to read it in a reading room. We could take notes, no copies. Over the course of a year, up until about January 2022, we got 350 of the 400 pages requested. Since January 2022, we've been fighting tooth and nail for the last 50 pages. This is what the FOIA request got. This is what it looks like. OK. There's obviously some important information in this last 50 pages. And we can't get it. They are flagrantly not complying with the laws. But there's no enforcement mechanism. They know that. The administration knows that. So this problem just gets worse. What kind of enforcement mechanism can we have for Congress to reclaim its oversight authority? So respectfully. And I do mean this respectfully. You do have a tool. And I'd be willing to bet that a certain gentleman from Ohio, who happens to be heading up a specific subcommittee or committee in the House of Representatives, would probably be willing to work with you to begin to incentivize bureaucrats within the executive branch to follow the law.",subjective

He doesn't give direct answers because he's an invertebrate. IZ wrote in on one crucial question. His website stated that he didn't believe government funds should not be used to pay for any abortions, and he was getting a lot of mileage out of that as well. So I pointed out, since he was supposed to know the law, especially running for attorney general, I pointed out that our government has something that's known as the Hyde Amendment, specifically states that tax dollars will not be used to pay for abortions except for the event of medical necessity for the mother's life or rape or incest. So I point blank asked him, does this mean that you believe a victim of rape should be forced to give birth? At that point, he decided it was time to leave, and he cut everything short. I said, I'm not going to let this go, Mr. Holley. You need to answer this question. And he did the typical politician thing and tried to shake my hands. It was really good meeting you. It was nice talking with you. I got to go. I chased him out of the restaurant. We weren't running, but it wasn't far from it because he was power walking. I mean, he was one of those mall walkers who just had a big cup of coffee. He was zipping right out there, and I asked him loudly. I said, are you saying that a rape victim should be forced to give birth? And he just acted like he didn't hear me. So yeah, this whole entire time, I've been saying Josh Holley is a piece of garbage. He does not represent the Missouri that I know. He's a self-serving jellyfish of a man. And I think he's a piece of garbage. And at this point, I wouldn't be surprised if he's a Russian asset. I mean, really.

So you guys remember how the R&C is now basically run by Trump? Check this out. Trump is hosting a fundraiser in Florida on April 6th to attract big donors. According to the Associated Press, the invitation says that their nations will first go to Trump's campaign, then to save America back, and then finally the R&C and state political parties. Because Donald Trump is going to be the nominee, it gives him access to larger donations. Unlike candidates who can only receive up to $3,300 in donations, this arrangement allows for a single donor to donate up to $800,000 and a couple to donate up to $1.6 million. When those checks are written, Trump's campaign and save America get paid first before the R&C ever sees a dime. So typically a national party committee looks out for down-belly candidates around the country and provides them with assistance like research, polling, financial support to help their campaign. But with this new agreement between the R&C and Donald Trump, it effectively serves as a way for Donald Trump to get all his legal bills paid.",subjective

I'm talking about Senator Josh Holley for Missouri and his wife, Aaron. Josh Holley used to be the clerk for our current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts. His wife, Aaron, who's a lawyer, who's part of the Federalist Society, she used to clerk for John Roberts as well. This is how they met. And when it comes to anti-abortion, these two, they're the power couple. You gotta give it to Josh Holley's wife who's a lawyer by the way.

She helped overturn Roe v. Wade. Today, she was at it again. This time, arguing against the abortion appeal. Mifra Priston. Because of corruption and money, this is how this case in Texas made its way to the Supreme Court. A federal judge who first oversaw this case and whose name is Matthew Tasmeric. He's an extremely far-right judge who was nominated by Trump. He's all about role and bad reproductive rights and LGBTQ plus rights. This is the biggest abortion case since Roe v. Wade, a group who brought this case to the judge. One of the lawyers, their name was Aaron Holley. Josh Holley's wife. Why was Ms. Holley so confident that this case will go all the way up to the Supreme Court? And it has something to do with donations? Let's do the math. Trump first nominated the judge Matthew in 2017, but it went nowhere. In 2018, at Judge, he donated to Josh Holley's Senate campaign. Early 2019, Josh Holley was sworn in. And Joan of 2019, that judge Matthew, who was confirmed by the Senate. Months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, hurting her team, they filed the abortion appeal lawsuit in a small town in Texas. And who was the single judge presiding over that case? Mr. Matthew. Facts and receipts don't lie.

Donald Trump, the businessman turned American president, took pride, reveled in taking full advantage of the government for his own financial gain. That detail from Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, was yet another in a series of revelations about Trump's tax paying habits that have come to light in recent years, including the mammoth piece of reporting, body of reporting by The New York Times, starting in 2020 that exposed Trump's chronic losses in years of tax avoidance. But today, an inflection point, a day that never seemed like it would come. After years of attempting to keep his tax returns private, Donald Trump's returns have been made public, six years of them, from 2015 to 2020, showing that he paid little taxes before and during his presidency, and that he reported no charitable contributions in 2020. The public release of these returns follows a years-long court battle, but the House Ways and Means Committee. Here's committee member Lloyd Dogget, a Democrat from Texas, on what in his view was uncovered. Here is the most powerful man in the world, the self-described clever genius who brags of his wealth almost daily. And he did not pay the taxes that the most modest wage earner in this country would pay. Everything in one year, $750 a year and others, all of this related to the claims for big losses, big deductions, big credits, taking advantage of every loophole. And because of the sorry job that Trump's Internal Revenue Service did, we don't know if how many of these were legal loopholes for the rich and how many of them were unjust and illegal because the IRS didn't do the job of auditing.

Governor Greg Giaforte, a man who is physically violent, my dad, on Wednesday afternoon signed into law Senate Bill 419, legislation introduced by Senator Shelley Vance, Republican Belgrade that banned social media app TikTok in the state of Montana beginning January 1, 2024. The bill, which garnered significant controversy during the legislative session, prohibits the operation of the app within the territorial jurisdiction of Montana and imposes fines on any entity that operates TikTok or allows users to download it through mobile application stores within Montana. Senate Bill 419 does not, however, include provisions that would allow the state to prosecute individual Montana's for using the app. So if you live in Montana and you already have the app downloaded, you should be fine. What I'm hearing, it sounds like they're just going to try to find TikTok and bite dance for distributing it to Montana's. Which how are they going to enforce that? So Giaforte on Wednesday characterized the bill as a critical step in protecting Montana's against spying for an adversaries. Okay, namely China, the country in which TikTok's parent company Bite Dance is based. Our dumbass governor said he's basically doing it to protect us from the Chinese Communist Party saying that they're using it to spy on us. And this is to protect Montana's private data and sensitive personal information from being harvested by the Chinese Communist Party. Idiot, dude. So back in December, he actually banned the use of TikTok on state-owned networks and devices, and the Montana University system in January blocked access to the app on campus networks. So opponents of the bill have argued that the ban would unfairly target the singular platform and would hurt Montana's who use TikTok to promote their businesses. The director of policy and advocacy for the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana said we also believe that this is a blatant exercise of censorship and is an egregious violation of Montana's free speech. The bill also states that if TikTok is sold to a company that is not incorporated into any other country designated as foreign adversary, then the law will be void. So that's all we really know for right now. We'll see what happens come January, but I find this embarrassing. I find this a self-report of their incompetency. Yeah, this is an embarrassment. I don't know how they're going to enforce it. They are what they hate, basically. And if you haven't looked into our governor, Geoforte, I highly recommend it. He physically assaulted a reporter.

They actually targeted those people in neighborhoods that people looked up to. It's the Kulaks. It's the head peasant. This is why one of the Russians, when the Bolsheviks came into Ukraine in the 1930s, it was to kill, they take out the Kulaks first. They take out the head peasant in the village. That people look up to it. My parents always thought of them as Kulaks. They were the simple people and the thing. But people kind of looked up to them because they were squared away. My mom had this focus. You've got to get all five kids to college, right? They never, nobody ever went to college. She went, oh, sister went first, but they got to graduate. You got to get there and you got to graduate on a time and you got to do it with as a de minimus debt as possible. And they get on in the world. That's the Kulaks. That's what they're trying to, that's what, that's what every revolutionary efforts ever gone at. Get to the family, you get to the Kulaks, you break the traditional family, and then we got it. That's what they're doing here. So what would you say to them? Your pitch, not mine, not Tucker Carlson's, not Donald Trump's yours, yours. The only way this movement makes progress is work on oneself. That would be your own self. Because that what makes this movement stronger every day, collectively, collectively, is the individuals, the free men and women, of which they did not in a million years. If they came back from the dead, they would think they were on another planet when they saw the way this country's run. They saw what's happening in the schools.

You ever noticed when you go back and all the bad stuffs are happening in 1971 and you say, hey, you know, I see some pattern recognition, or what happened back then? over a weekend they just got us off the convertibility to gold.

So I can the French Revolution when they had everybody to get it to raise taxes to pay, because essentially a pay for the 100 year war, particularly the part in the United States called the American Revolution. To pay the bonds off that. And they said, hey, we gotta get it right together to raise taxes. And one of the CFO, the Treasury said, hey, what we should do is we should publish in these broadsheets the accounts of the country. And when they publish it, the people said, wow, we looked around, this is a paradise. It's a paradise that can generate a lot of cash. But it ain't being spent on us. It's being spent at Versailles. It's being spent on these aristocrats that are dancing around and doing all this. And that's when the revolution got real. That's when it came a little bit off the chain.

It must have been quite a shot because New York, up to that point, was a pretty quiet city. It was a business city, so you had significant support for the rebels, but also significant support for the people who are still loyal to the king. A month later, Joseph Reed, Secretary to George Washington, tracks the British fleet massing off New York. Over 400 ships, the largest British naval task force until D-Day. 32,000 British troops prepared to storm Manhattan Island. They outnumber Patriot forces to the one. Just five of the biggest British ships carry more firepower than all the Patriot guns in the city. Reed is awed by the sight. When I look down and see the prodigious fleet they have collected, I cannot help being astonished that a people should come 3,000 miles at such risk, trouble and expense to rob, flunder and destroy another people because they will not lay their lives and fortune at their feet. It's the biggest attack on New York City until September 11, 2001. But the rebels will stand in fight. The difference for me was that the British army was fighting for a king and the American were fighting for their lives. Plum Martin is one of 500 men standing guard at Kipps Bay. Have a look. The first thing that saluted a rise was all four ships at Eckerd, within musket shot of us. At Phoenix. I could read her name as a sting place though, as directly underneath her stern.

The Supreme Court has agreed to hear an NRA Free Speech Challenge. So here's a little bit of background on this case. In 2018, after the Marjorie Stoeman Douglas High School tragedy, New York State Department of Financial Services Superintendent Maria Volo called on banks and insurance companies operating in New York to discontinue their association with Pew-Pew Promoting Groups. So after multiple entities cut ties or decided not to do business with the Child Sacrificing Group, the NRA, I mean the Fairfax Virginia-based organization.

Clearly, the ACLU is the 800-pound gorilla on the First Amendment. The ACLU made this statement, we don't support the NRA's mission or its viewpoints on Pew-Pew, right? And we don't agree with their goals, strategies, or tactic. But we know that government officials can't punish organizations because they just approve of their views.

I can't believe this is real, it's real. This is the Republican Attorney General of Texas, his name is Ken Paxton, although he is not currently serving as Attorney General because he has been suspended from office by the Texas legislature pending an impeachment trial. Now how bad do things have to be for the Republicans in the Texas legislature to impeach their own Republican Attorney General? Well, where do we start? Almost the entire time he's been Attorney General, he's been under indictment for felony securities fraud. Meanwhile he's facing potential disbarment from the practice of law entirely over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Also he's under criminal investigation by the U.S. Justice Department on serious corruption allegations. Allegations so serious that eight high ranking officials in his own office went to the FBI to report what they had witnessed in his office. Earlier this year, Paxton reached a multi-million dollar settlement in a lawsuit for allegedly firing several of those officials as retaliation for them going to the FBI. It has been a lot with this guy, but hilariously it was only when Paxton demanded that Texas taxpayers fork over the millions of dollars to pay that settlement that Republicans in the legislature finally started to get a little bit cranky with him. The Texas House impeached Ken Paxton by an overwhelming margin. So that means the Texas Senate now has to put him on trial. They'll hold an impeachment trial in September. If he's convicted at that Senate impeachment trial, he will lose his job permanently. Now here's where it gets amazing. That trial will be presided over by the president of the Senate, the lieutenant governor of the state, a man named Dan Patrick. As the presiding judge overseeing Paxton's impeachment trial, he'll have immense power. He'll be the ultimate arbiter of the rules and the admissibility of evidence and all that stuff. Here's the thing I can't believe is real, but it is. So Dan Patrick, the guy who's the presiding judge in this impeachment trial, just had to release his new campaign finance report. And would you look at that? He just received three million dollars from the Ken Paxton Superback. Wow, what a coincidence. Dan Patrick isn't even up for reelection until 2026. All he has coming up is this impeachment trial that he has to run in a few weeks. And here's the pack for the defendant in that impeachment trial dumping three million dollars on his porch just ahead of the trial. Wow, everything is bigger in Texas. Amazing.",subjective

The virus hit the United States particularly hard, around 20% of all COVID-19-related deaths. And the world's happens in the United States, despite the country making up just over 4% of the world's population. By election day, it had killed around 235,000 Americans and many blamed President Donald Trump. Compared to other world leaders, Trump was slow to respond to the pandemic and originally downplayed the severity of the virus. Not only that, the economy was doing worse than it had since the Great Depression. Businesses closed and suffered due to lockdowns after local politicians tried to slow the spread of the virus. On-employments got as high as almost 15%. Despite wages slowly ticking up in the previous three years, nearly half of all Americans still lived paycheck to paycheck, meaning when the economy crashed in 2020, they had no savings to get them by. Trump also became just the third president in American history to be impeached for abusive power and obstruction of Congress after he allegedly tried to get Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on Joe Biden's son to hurt Biden's election campaign. More on that in a bit. Well, the Senate's acquitted Trump with nearly every Republican voting to keep him in office. But it wasn't just the impeachment.

I know the fundraising stuff is the boring part of politics, but this is why I think the Republicans are going to lose. The Republicans are raising significantly less amount of money. In October, for instance, they raised half of what they've raised in previous years. The RNC stated they had the least amount of cash on hand since February of 2015. Why is this? Well, because nobody wants to support Donald Trump. Contrary to what's happening with the population, the people that are higher up don't want to fund him. And the answer is to why is pretty simple. He keeps using their money for legal fees. In fact, in the first half of this year, Donald Trump spent something like $42 million on staying ahead of jail and only 15 million campaigning. And with the New York fraud case going on, he's not likely to have that much money left, meaning he's going to run in campaign until the wheels fall off because he needs to raise money to stay out of jail. That may not seem that important, but we know that spending millions of dollars or tens of millions of dollars to get people out to vote does affect elections.

Number three, I cannot speak to an ongoing personnel matter. Why has this person not been fired? Your answer is you can't speak to it? This isn't sufficient to fire her?

I'm asking you how many cases she adjudicated? My answer remains. Did she adjudicate any cases involving Israelis seeking asylum in this country? Same answer. Well, let me disappoint you to what else she posted on social media. Where she drew attention to the fact that she is an immigration and asylum officer. Hashtag immigrants, hashtag asylum seekers, hashtag palestine, hashtag refugees. Welcome. This is on her linked end post, where she has her professional affiliation posted. So I think the American people deserve to know. Has she admitted contrary to law individuals who should not be in this country or denied Jewish refugees whose genocide she's advocating, asylum that they deserve? Same answer. You're not going to tell us what this person's done. Are you conducting review of her cases at least? Senator, as I have said, over and over again, I cannot speak to an ongoing person. You said that you will not. I can't believe that you would come to this committee knowing this. You know about this. I've written to you about it. You know all about it. And you come here unwilling to answer and suggest that it is wrong of me to ask you the question. Quite frankly, Mr. Secretary, I think that your performance is despicable. And I think the fact that you are not willing to provide answers to this committee is absolutely atrocious. Mr. Chairman, may I? If you'd like to have a minute to respond, you are obliged. I would. I'm not sure I'll limit it to 60 seconds. That's fine. Number one, what I found despicable is the implication that this language, tremendously odious, actually could be emblematic of the sentiments of the 260,000 men and women of the Department of Homeland Security. Number one. Number two, Senator Hawley takes an adversarial approach to me in this question. And perhaps he doesn't know my own background. Perhaps he does not know that I am the child of a Holocaust survivor. Perhaps he does not know that my mother lost almost all her family at the hands of the Nazis. And so I find his adversarial tone to be entirely misplaced. I find it to be disrespectful of me and my heritage. And I do not expect an apology, but I did want to say what I just articulated.

This went so far beyond the accidental tourist that his lawyer, Bill Shipley, laid it out to the judge as that the Department of that the judge concluded, sorry, the judge concluded at the end that he was a person in front of him, Leo Brent Bozell. I'll just call them Zeaker that Zeaker was a major contributor to the chaos that happened on Jan 6th. Think about the chaos on Jan 6th, the bloodshed, the carnage, the steps that were wet with blood according to the testimony of capital police in battles that reminded her, she was a former military person, part of our military, reminded her of Fulugia and the fighting there. And this judge concluded that Zeaker was the was a major contributor to the chaos, particularly the Department of Justice.

Bozell marks with the crowd to the capital grounds and made his way past police barriers. Bozell approached the Northwest stairs, lying with bike racks and police officers trying to prevent the mob from accessing the capital. Bozell used a bike rack as a makeshift ladder to ascend to the landing platform. Once there, he waved others up the steps as he stood face to face with the capital police. While at the front of the mob, another rioter coordinated the crowd yelling, are you ready to push? Are you ready to push the rioters with Bozell at the front, barrel through the police line? And once at the top of the stairs, the mob overtook the police line, gaining a path to the capital building. The judge blamed Bozell for overt running the first light of defense at the capital.",subjective

For America, I had to choose between 9-0-3M and Joe-5M. And in 2024, we're going to somehow see a rematch for the US presidency. It gets even creepier because 2020's Super Bowl 54 hosted a war between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers, where Patrick Mahomes came back from being down 10 points to when his first trophy. And last night, as Super Bowl 58, Patrick Mahomes would come back from being down exactly 10 points to the San Francisco 49ers once again.

Mr. Josh Hawley, born December 31st, 1979, his family would soon after move to Lexington, Missouri, because of all the Lexingtons in the world to choose from with why not Missouri. Despite living his entire life in those square states in the middle that nobody can pick out on a map, he was fortunate enough to be born into money. Daddy was a well-to-do banker and sent him to prep school in Kansas City, where he really honed in on that douchey rich kid personality. The kind that makes that little voice in your head ask if you know punching a child is really that bad. During his prep school years, he wrote columns for the local newspaper, where he denounced affirmative action. Wrote a whole column defending right-wing extremist groups right after Timothy McVeigh did the thing he did. Then he'd go on to get his BA in history from Stanford. One can only assume because he wanted to deep-dive into what would have made 1930s Germany just a little bit more successful. Then he'd go on to get his juris doctor from Yale, and spend some time working for the Beckett Fund for Religious Liberty. There's basically a bunch of religious nuts who also happen to be lawyers and spend their time lobbying the Supreme Court to make us a theocracy. Then sometimes a faculty member for Blackstone Legal Fellowship, just like a training summer camp that teaches lawyers how to force their religious beliefs on gay people and women. In 2016, he would go on to run for a Attorney General of Missouri, or David Humphries, or Rich CEO, would spend $4.4 million of his own money to buy the election for Holly. The first things he did as a Attorney General was choose to not prosecute Sheriff Cory Hutchinson, and the officers involved in tasing and beating a mentally ill-maned death in jail, which they did because they didn't have any reason to hold Tory Sanders, this mentally ill man, and he didn't want to leave because he was scared. You got annoyed that he wouldn't leave, they just pepper sprayed him and beat him until he died of excited delirium, which is a completely made-up thing not recognized by anybody in the psychiatric field, but often used by cops who don't want to admit that they beat tays and pepper sprayed people to death while they were in custody. How were we supposed to know that beating somebody nearly to death would make them so excited they might actually die? So not off to a great start, but his next big move as AG would be going after Big Pharma, like Pfizer, for their roles in the opioid epidemic. So that wasn't such a bad thing, you know? And then when the Columbia, Missouri, and in a huge expose on Missouri, ignoring the problem of rape and having a huge backlog of untested rape kits, all the order to not it of those rape kits and found that there was 5,000 untested, many investigated Google for violating any trust and consumer protection laws. Oh, maybe he's starting to come around or redemption might be possible. But then there was that whole scandal with Eric Gritons, the Missouri governor, like misusing public funds and then having it affair and blackmailing the woman to keep it quiet. And at first, Holly absolutely refused to investigate it, and then he got a whole bunch of heat for that. So he's like, okay, I'll investigate it. And he's like, eh, I looked into it. There's nothing there, you know? And then once the evidence became so overwhelming, it couldn't be ignored. And he stepped down. Holly was like, yeah, that's good enough. We don't need to charge him with a felony, you know? And then in 2018, a bunch of Republican states got together again to have another lawsuit again about the Affordable Care Act being unconstitutional again. And of course, it would fail again. Holly was all too excited to jump on board with that. And then later that year, Bobby Bostick would come in the news for appealing his sentencing of 241 years for robbery at the age of 16. A sentence that violated a Supreme Court ruling that stated that miners could not be sent into life for charges less than homicide. And Josh came out to publicly defend the sentence. As a result, Bobby is still in prison today and will be for the rest of his life, for committing robbery at 16 years old. Something Josh Holly feels is an absolutely appropriate punishment. So don't worry, guys, your gut wasn't wrong. He's still a piece of shit. At this time, Holly was also running for Senate. And he decided that he would use a state staff as his personal campaign staff, which is illegal. And because he was attorney general, he knew that that was illegal. So he covered it up, which is, you know, also illegal. For this, the attorney general's office was fine $12,000. Where's that wrist? I'm feeling a little sloppy. Anyway, after being endorsed by the Bronze or Cat, he went on to win his senatorial race almost a year after he was sworn in as attorney general, and after criticizing other politicians for for ladder climbing and not spending enough time in their in their first elected position. He said, but no, guys, it's different for me because I didn't plan on running for Senate when I was running for attorney general. Just just kind of happened. I just sort of fell into being a senator, you know, by accident, up to sea. And then immediately after getting elected, an inquiry was opened into him, misappropriating public funds during his campaign. And since then, he's taken all the worst parts about Mitch McConnell and all the worst parts about Ted Cruz and just mashed them together and is like, that's the senator I want to be. Doing things like being the only senator to vote against a bill amendment to investigate anti-Asian hate crime. And openly admitting shit like he thinks government should be guided by scripture. And being the only senator to vote against Sweden and Finland joining NATO because China. That's literally his only reason is they shouldn't join because China is a threat. In that same vein, we shouldn't support Ukraine and they also shouldn't be allowed to join NATO because China also went on a really big anti-Semitic rant about the cosmopolitan agenda. Then when it was pointed out that Joseph Stalin used the same cosmopolitan terminology as anti-Semitic rhetoric. He's like, oh no, you guys just don't read an internet. What? Willie, because like anybody else talks about the cosmopolitan elites. This is a good one on human trafficking. Joshy Washchuk's Holly says that it's only a problem because of the sexual revolution of the 1960s and premarital sex and contraception. Oh, and Hollywood. If everybody else was just like him where they got married and only banged their wife, those three times she got drunk enough to tolerate being touched by him, human trafficking wouldn't be a thing. And I mean, obviously that makes total sense. Sexually repressed married men never get caught paying for sex or sleeping with minors. I'm sure everybody on Epstein's client list was single. He still looks like he's 13 and I still want to punch him in the throw and that is just just fucking with my head a little bit. In a weird moment of him not being a horrible human being, he teamed up with Bernie Sanders to fight for those $1200 COVID checks we got. So I guess not not all bad credit where it's due. Then 2020 happened and he went off the rails like Norfolk's other. He's the first senator to object to certifying the election result. Blabbered on and on about baseless election fraud claims like he was a pillow salesman on a coke vendor. He got so annoying with the election fraud bullshit that even Walmart tweeted telling him to shut the fuck up hashtags or loser. Some protesters getting fed up with him trying to subvert democracy went to his house and held a protest in the form of a candlelight vigil. Now when they left they left him a copy of the constitution in case you know he ever felt like maybe reading it and he had a full blown meltdown. A temper tantrum fit for that toddler face he's got. Saying oh that scumbag antifa came to my house and vandalized it and threatened my family. And then when the vana virginia police were asked about this horrific vandalism of a senator's house they're like uh sure what what he's talking about. I mean they they wrote in chalk on the sidewalk out front but that that's not technically vandalism. I don't know they seemed pretty peaceful to us. We didn't we didn't think it was that big of a deal. And then January 6th happens. Holly runs out to salute the trees and tribe and hold up his white power fist. And at some point during his cheering on sedition it dawned on him that these are just a bunch of mouth-breathing troglodytes who probably don't have any fucking clue who he actually is. And these people do only have the hard drive space to remember like three people in Washington and they reserve that space for Donald Trump Hillary Clinton and Hunter Biden's laptop. So at a certain point like Ralph from the Simpsons he thought to himself I'm in danger. And then there's security footage of him running away like a little bitch. The kind of little bitch who would think that sidewalk chalk is vandalism. After this he started to get hated by pretty much everybody. John Danforth went on to say that mentoring Holly was the worst mistake of his entire life. Yale said that he should be disbarred. Airbnb AT&T Mastercard Best Buy American Express and a few others all pulled their funding from him. Hallmark literally asked him to give their contributions to his campaign back. Most people would be like you know maybe maybe have crossed a line. But by Golly Holly was not going to be dissuaded by you know Democrats or Republicans or the voters the media or his colleagues or his mentors or his teachers or a sense of decency or morals or pride or values. He used the opportunity of being persecuted by the cancel culture to fundraise, to fight back against cancel culture. Can you get any more cancel culture than trying to cancel democracy because it hurts your feelings? Anyway since then he's written a TikTok band that sucks so much it got blocked by the senate. Otherwise has just been obstructionist for the sake of being obstructionist which means he doesn't really accomplish anything. So he continues to just whine about election fraud, vote against everybody who hurts his feats and masturbate every night to pictures of Donald Trump because his wife probably sleeps in a completely different house. Yeah he is just one of many many glaring examples of why Missouri should not be allowed to make decisions on anything. Seriously Missouri you are just very clearly not okay lately. I think we need you to to turn in your senators and your representatives and just work on you guys for a while. Take some personal days. Maybe a vacation, take some time, read a book if you haven't burned them all already. Maybe take your child bride to Chuck E. Cheese for date night. I don't know just go take some time, get your head right and don't worry. We've got everything over here handled just go away.",subjective

Dozens of trucks and other vehicles could have been seen blocking the downtown area of Ottawa as protesters rallied against vaccine mandates masks and lockdowns. That seems like an interesting way to spend your weekend. The demonstrations were initially aimed at pushback against vaccine mandates for truck drivers crossing the U.S. Canada border. But the movement escalated into an expression of disapproval with the Canadian government's COVID-19 policies. Officials say several investigations are underway into reports of severe vandalism and criminal behavior, including the desecration of national monuments. Meanwhile, Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said some protesters harassed a soup kitchen demanding free meals because they're refusal to wear masks meant they were not to order in restaurants.

I mean, if this is what they say they want to do and it is, how do you get away from it? The reason they've written to the Biden administration saying they claim this right is because the Biden administration says they should not have the right to do this. The Biden administration is trying to assert federally that attorneys general from states where abortion is banned can't follow their residents to other states to see if they're getting banned care from someplace where it's legal. Beyond those efforts to protect this at the federal level from the Biden administration, you've also started to see blue states places like New York and Washington state that have also passed state laws saying that nobody should be able to get private medical records like this. Just because you've banned abortion in your state doesn't mean you can effectively enforce it in mind. But here's 19 Republican states, 19 Republican state attorney general saying they're going for it. And maybe they already are. When reporter Joe Sanka from the Louisville Courier Journal today asked the Kentucky Attorney General's Office if they have already pursued private medical records from Kentucky women who've had medical treatment in other states, the Attorney General's Office didn't give Joe Sanka an answer. He says he has still not heard back from the Attorney General's Office about this, which leaves open the possibility that maybe they are already doing this, maybe they are already trying or getting these medical records.

Well I have not considered myself in those terms, Senator. Well let me explain what I mean. You have 125 motions pending that you declined to decide. Well, let me finish. That's more than any other district judge in the entire seventh circuit. In fact, you rank seven tires nationally. Do you not? I am not familiar with those statistics, Senator Kennedy. You haven't looked. I did look in preparation for this hearing but I didn't compare myself to others. You haven't seen that you ranked the seventh the worst in the country in terms of making decisions. You are the first to tell me this. And I think for me, I stress the quality of my decision in making. And as I explained, I came on. I was the first district judge to come on during this administration. Yeah, but so are all the others. I mean, there have been 68 district judges confirmed in the 117th Congress in terms of motions pending for more than six months. You rank number three. You all came on at the same time. You all had the same problems with COVID. You're the third worst. You really think of all the other district judges in the seventh circuit. You're the one that ought to be promoted based on this record. Senator, this is something that I've discussed with my fellow judges. Many of us new judges from not you said you'd never looked at these statistics. I haven't these particular statistics. I am not familiar with. But in terms of new judges, both from the current administration and the former administration, we are quite a collegial bunch. And oftentimes talk about the pressures of a new judge and the way reassignments work in our district, which is that you get, for example, 300 cases. As I understand, I'm familiar with the procedure in federal court. Here's what I'm trying to understand. Why is your record so bad? Well, I don't view it that way, Senator. And I look at the quality of my decision making, the feedback that I get from parties. Well, first parties are not going to criticize you. That points you to ruin their favor. I understand, Senator Kennedy. That's just the way it works. Help me understand why you have such an abysmal, record-ing moving cases. I mean, it costs a lot of money to mitigate. And people are paying lawyers. And time is money. And of all the district court judges in the seventh circuit, you're the worst. In terms of moving cases, why do you think you deserve to be promoted over all of those others? So, Senator, again, I'm not familiar with the statistics, but I stand by my record and that I give parties what they need. I think, I am regularly in my courtroom. I am regularly issuing decisions. I just came on at a very difficult time where there was a backlog in the courts.

Senator, sitting here today, as I said, I did not write that brief. I was local counsel- Sign the brief. I understand. At the time- Tell me what you wanted to ban. That's all I want to know. I don't remember the exact definition of assault weapons in the ordinance that was at issue. So, you submitted a brief to the- On a penalty brief, you signed it.

I apologize here If a person's put in a single In a separation cell is that considered solitary confinement? There is no such term in the state of Texas. It's separation cell, sir So I guess based off of the definition that's been used here.

Things are, the fit is hitting the share. It really is. We just had a great article break about Mike Johnson, the speaker of the house. A guy by the name of Constantine Nicolayev, donated to his campaign. That's the Russian that was funding Maria Boutina, the Russian spy that infiltrated the Republican party, via the NRA. The Russian spy that when she was caught, arrested, and eventually deported, was met in Russia with bouquets of flowers because of what a great job she had done damaging our country. Yeah, that guy's donated to Mike Johnson. But that's not even close to scratching the surface of it. We've got Alexander Smirnoff that's been arrested. He's a Russian spy that James Comer and Jimmy Jordan and all of them were using to try to take down an American president. He is admitted to investigators that his information came from the Russian government. Directly from Russian intelligence and Republicans were more than happy to work with them. Knowing what this guy is, they work babes in the woods. James Comer, Jimmy Jordan, they're committed, with their committee assignments, they have clearances and are briefed. When they picked up Alexander Smirnoff as a witness, they were briefed as to what he was. The government told them. But they were willing to work with him anyways to try to take down an American president for their own power. And it doesn't stop there. It's not just federal. Wired. Just did an amazing job. They hired two firms that specialize in disinformation to take a look at what's going on down here at my border, down here in Texas. The border with Mexico. And they were able to find coordination between the Russian government. You remember Medvedev, the former president of Russia, who's now the head of their Security Council. He came out and made a bunch of statements about civil war here in Texas and that we're being invaded and all those talking points. And when Putin was sitting down with Tuckio Rose, I mean, just out of the blue for some reason, he brings up our border with Mexico. Well, it turns out that their intelligence has been working through telegram and X-chan, you know, Twitter, the site formerly known as Twitter, I call it X-chan, to just pump information out, misinformation out about our southern border. And so many, the idea of civil war, you remember that all the talk that just suddenly blew up. Civil war, civil war, is Texas going to secede and I had people sending me emails all over the place. Is Texas going to secede? No, they were not going to secede. That was all a Russian hot. And look how the Republicans were more than one of the Republicans.

We're going to have to really show up in big numbers and change the electoral map, increase the numbers in the House, win the Senate, and elect Donald Trump. We really have any hope of saving this country, aren't we? I mean, the Democrats are not interested in compromise. They're interested in monopoly power. My big fear is if people sit back, they sit back, think about how much further the Democrats would go. Republicans have the House. They're able to stop a lot. But I will tell you this for everybody sitting at home, this is a unique opportunity. If the election was held today, President Trump would win. Really on the merits of people can measure what we've been able to accomplish. But really on the port card of Joe Biden itself, war around the world, a border that's wide open, fit and all, killing Americans. We had five embassies have to evacuate. The decisions he has made has harmed us for decades, the way he got out of Afghanistan, attacking our own allies, walking back our support for Israel, which we have to as Americans stay firm with the only democracy, with our truest of friends in Israel. But what you find, too, is I believe the Republicans can pick up the Senate, one of the best maps they have. But even in the House, we have an opportunity to gain seats. It's easier to win seats in this election than it was in the last two when we won. And if you look at voter registration, Republican numbers are up in Pennsylvania. They're up in Florida. They're up in a number of these swing states. So if we do our jobs and bring more people than just Republicans, invite everybody that wants to have a secure border, we watched earlier this week inflation is back based upon democratic policies.

Polygamy emerged a one-man to multiple women, devalued women, and made them a kind of property. Slavery, of course, did the same to blacks, literally. The Democrats were so opposed to the Republicans in their anti-slavery stands that in 1860, just six weeks after the election of the first Republican President Abraham Lincoln, South Carolina, a state dominated by Democrats voted to succeed from the Union. The Civil War that followed was the bloodiest war in US history. It led to the passage by Republicans of the 13th Amendment, which freed the slaves, the 14th Amendment, which gave them citizenship, and the 15th Amendment, which gave them the vote. In 1870, the first black senator and the first black congressman were sworn in, both Republicans.

So what was the formula that you found work best? Well, when I first started all this, I had been consuming radical content on YouTube for about six months after the Orlando shooting. I remember I typed that theme into YouTube and was inundated with YouTube videos from Rebel Media and one American News Network type channels. I ended up going down that rabbit hole. I ended up becoming a correspondent for Rebel Media of which I obtained millions of views. And my boss always told me, and the bosses of these other organizations always told me that we should never let the truth get in the way of a good story. And if we can get people angry, and if we can get people upset, we can make more money, we can make more profit, and we can drive the algorithms to keep pushing these videos. It's what made me feel very disenfranchised and I end up speaking out of it all at the end. But as someone who really believed in it and believed that free speech was under attack and that the West was being invaded and all these ideas that they were pushing, I really felt that if I had to take part in disinformation and take part in bending the truth, then it was for the greater good. But actually my boss is, and the people at the top of the Zico system, from Newsmax and all these organizations from Project Veritas, which collaborated with Breville at the time, it was all fair again, because the left were just so terrible. But actually the kind of tactics that they were engaged in, and even myself now looking back were engaged in, were far worse than the, quote unquote, liberal media and CNN, and any of these groups ever took part in. It was completely devoid of any realism or any journalism. We would go to quote unquote, no go zones in 2018 when Fox News would hype up that whole situation. And we would create conflict and then selectively edit it to look like those areas were far more dangerous than they were. Those videos would obtain millions and millions of views. Again, I regret that massively. The only reason I did it was because I was radicalized by those people and felt like it was for the greater good and it was a bit of a cult. But those people profited massively from it and it was always about pushing disinformation. Alex Jones, who I spent a lot of intimate time with and a lot of the people that employed me told me openly that they thought the whole pizza gate staff and the pizza file staff and all the stuff that they were pushing is something that they don't really care about, I already believe in. But it whips up their audience into anger and it gets them to buy products on their news nights.",subjective

Matt Rive's alt-right red pill journey is finally complete. You finally made it onto the Jordan Peterson podcast. Well done. The fact that Jordan Peterson finds you funny and wants to talk to you, it's not a good sign, babes. Not a good sign. I'm a huge fan, man. I've done extensive research into everything you've done, but I find you'd be a very kind man and very well spoken. Yeah, it's clear you have no idea what Jordan Peterson stands for because otherwise you would not be proud to be sat opposite him. The man who thought that a plus-size model on a magazine is authoritarian thought that your domestic violence joke was funny, shocking. Remember when he got suspended on Twitter because he was so aggressively transferred back towards Elliot Page? Or when he called doctors who provide gender-affirming care, butchers and that they should be treated with no mercy? What about the fact that he's a climate change denier who went on Joe Rogan to spread a bunch of conspiracy theories that were literally debunked by climate scientists? Can't imagine why Jordan Peterson would find misogyny funny. But no makeup in the workplace. Why would that be? Why should you wear makeup in the workplace? Isn't that sexually provocative? The redening of the lips, for example, and the raging of the cheeks is not only a signal to mimic youth and fertility, but it's likely associated with mimicry of ripe fruit because our visual system evolved to detect ripe fruit. No one tell them about purple lipstick or orange blush and she might blow his mind. It's a question about appropriate behavior in the workplace. That's very good. And I'm also not saying that women shouldn't wear makeup in the workplace. I said it's a question. Bro, God, so mad. He does have a point though. I don't think men should be shaving in the workplace because you know, enhances their jawline, which is obviously to enhance their sexual attractiveness. Men shouldn't wear suits in the workplace because you know you're accentuating your broad shoulders, which is an indicator of sexual attractiveness. Should men be wearing suits and shaving in the workplace? It's just a question. Actually, my favorite Jordan Peterson moment when he wasn't sure if he agreed with the legalisation of gay marriage or not. With regards to gay marriage specifically, that's a really tough one for me. It's a means whereby gay people can be integrated more thoroughly into standard society, and that's probably a good thing. It's probably a good thing that we let those gay freaks fit into standard normal society. This is who Matt Rife looks up to, and it's because they've both been cancelled. Instead of apologising for his transphobic misogynistic tweets and getting some social media training, Jordan Peterson would rather lose his licence to practice psychology. Rather than apologise for the insensitive jokes that he's made, Matt Rife has doubled down and run to the conservative safe space that is the daily wire. This interview is absolutely that shit insane. They conflate men who support women and are feminists with sneaky rapists. I saw one take to a video who was like, I have a wife and I found this severely disrespectful. I was like, okay, you cut. Yeah, whatever. Yeah, yeah. What do you want to get more money for? What do you want to get more money? I'll send you your wife. Bro, you only pretend you don't like jokes about men beating up women because you're trying to sleep with more women. Doesn't this go to show what they think about women? You only believe that a man would support women and support feminism for sexual gratification because that's the way you view women as a sexual conquest. A herodine woman who is screeching like fish wives, but the men that were hypothetically there to support the men I tell you, I couldn't even look at some of those guys, without having to shut her run up my spine. There's almost nothing worse than a man who tries to worm himself in with a group of women by pretending to be moral on their side than they women actually are. When their actual motivation is to use that, what was that guy said, the elderly sheary psychologist who works at Concordia, he called out the sneaky fucker, a routine. Hi, I'm a man. I support women. I support feminism. Am I just trying to fuck women? Oh, no, wait, one minute. I'm a homosexual. He justifies this point by bringing up orangutans. I'm not joking. There are two variant male types of orangutans. The males who become dominant. They get so large they can't really go in trees anymore. And the females come to them. But then there are other males in the vicinity. They look like adolescent males and they hang around in the trees. But they turn out to be many of them fully mature males whose development into the linebacker is forced all by the fact that they're north at the top of the pecking order. And so their strategy is sneaky rape. Right, right. So it doesn't take much of an imagination to map that on to the feminist male who's so on the side of women that he gets to be the friend who can entice some poor girl into bed when she's at her lowest point. Feminist men want to rape women. You know why? Because smaller orangutans rape other orangutans. I forgot that orangutans have the exact same complex understanding of human gender, gender theory, gender stereotypes, gender-based violence that we do. Fascinating. My other favorite part is drawing the prediscine and countering the concept of improvisation for the first time. You're doing... It seems to be something that's much more akin to spontaneous wit. That's a dangerous thing to do because you could easily be not funny. Because you're doing that, you don't have a lot of time to... Exactly. Think through what you're going to say, right? I mean, if something strikes you as amusing, you pretty much have to go for it. And if you're... If you're head full of censorship-related thoughts, you're going to be not funny in about 15 seconds. God, if only there was one word to describe that. I'm one of those assholes that takes improv classes. And one of the first things we were taught is that we have to allow for the likelihood that something offensive might occur. But if the first thing that comes to your mind is something misogynistic or transphobic, homophobic, etc. You might want to take a look at yourself. Why was that the first thing that came to your mind? Also, in my experience, the urge to say something offensive is a result of not trusting yourself that you are funny, and that you want to provoke a reaction in the audience. Because if the audience isn't laughing or reacting in the way that you expected them to, you might want to say something ridiculous outlandish offensive in order to provoke a response from them. Because any response from the audience is better than just dead silence. That is not good improvisation and it's not good comedy. Most of the scenes that I've done when I've resorted to insulting my partner or trying to start a conflict, kills the scene because it's not productive to the comedy. You also have to be very selective about the pain that you're exploiting for comedy. For example, as a gay person, I can make light of homophobia because I've experienced it. That is my pain that I share with myself and my community. I can make jokes out of that. Homophobia is something neither of these two men are ever going to have to really contend with. So it's not their place to make jokes out of it. Just like how it wasn't Matt Rive's place to make a joke out of a domestic violence situation. Why wasn't the punchline of that joke at the expense of the perpetrator of that violence rather than the victim of it? Running to conservatives and daddy Peterson who will protect you from the work liberals who are trying to cancel you is just cowardly. They'll complain about cancel culture and lick each other's wounds about how you can't tell misogynistic jokes anymore. This is the alt-right pint-plane in action. Don't fool for it.",subjective

They tolerated what went on at Tiananmen until those young art students and those young protesters started to put up the goddess of democracy. Why couldn't they do that? They understood that that was an image as powerful as the stature of liberty. And that would incite a revolution throughout mainland China. And that's when they came up with a plan to eradicate it.

We are live at the planet Hollywood on the strip in Las Vegas, Nevada, here at the Restoring National Confidence Conference, put on by Turning Point USA. Yersley was pretty explosive, ended with some power speeches by Michael and Del Don Jr., Donald Trump Jr., and of course Charlie Kirk. But Yersley was a tremendous day of organizing. What this is, you've got, I don't know, 5, 600 of precinct committee men. You've got Republican County Chairman. You have, I think we've got 50 or 60, maybe even more Republican National Committee people here. Nobody's happy at all with how the RNC's been run. This is a organizing meeting for the next couple of days, organizing committee to make sure that we get organized for 2024. You saw right there just absolutely incredible is first time in 100 years. First time in 100 years, we're going to have impeached today a vote in the Homeland Security Council. They're impeaching, by the way, we're here live. Got a great group here of Turning Point USA that getting all jacked up, getting ready to go in for the conference. There's going to be an impeachment vote today with Mayorkas that impeachment vote. First time in 100 years, a cabinet secretary is being impeached. And here's what we've got to understand. The Mayorkas position, Homeland Security, that's absolutely central to the Senate bill that they're putting up. The Senate is putting up a bill today. The Senate is putting up a bill today or over the next couple of days you get to read the text. This is the one that Langford and the other traders have been working on. That bill is absolutely the only way can be executed is the chairman of the Secretary of Homeland Security. So before the text of the bill gets released, this Anastie bill that President Trump is adamant about should not be passed, the chief person to execute it is being impeached. His number one crime, the high crimes and misdemeanors number one is failure to execute the laws are on the books. I want you to think of the absurdity of this that after a one year process, the House Homeland Security Committee is putting forward for the first time in 100 years to impeach a cabinet secretary for breaking the law. What laws are he breaking? Essentially all the immigration laws. He's being impeached for that. The Senate, and this is how over the top and crazy it is, is putting forward an Anastie bill to essentially codify the invasion of our country. In that codification, the only control mechanism they have is the Secretary of Homeland Security who would execute all of these various changes to the Amnesty laws. It's absurd on the face of it. As President Trump said, as Speaker Johnson said, as MTG and many others have said, we have all the laws on the books we need today to shut down the border. Speaker Johnson reiterated this yesterday, that's why Speaker Johnson, we begged you not to go forward with the CR. Either shut down the border or shut down the government. We have enough laws in the books today. President Trump reiterated this yesterday. President Trump reiterated this that all you have to do is execute it right there. When President Trump was in, he closed the border to this type of mass asylum, this type of mass, illegal invasion, illegal immigration. He shut it down okay, he shut it down with the laws are on the books. We don't need any more laws now to have HR two and these other things at the House is pass to be terrific. But that's just additional bells and whistles. That's on the margin and can make it better just to reiterate. What reiterate president Trump said yesterday we have all the laws in the books we need. This Langford bill what he's been working on is a complete sellout of the country, a sellout of the nation. It is a codification of a mass invasion of the country. It would essentially leave 8 to 10 to 12 U.S. tied bensmen. Not the 30 or 40 million that have been here for decades and decades and decades. I'm talking about just since Joe Biden's reign of terror. The illegitimate regime of Joe Biden. When Joe Biden came in what he's done to the board has brought anywhere from 8 to 12 million illegal alien invaders here a massive increase to our federal spending to take care of it all. That bill is to codify. That bill is to put in place laws that would protect that. It would give work permits. I think the six million people immediately the thing is a total complete disaster and we don't need any of it. And to show that, my Yorkers will get in peach today first time in 100 years. Now I want to go back to the cold open. I understand it. Ben Burkram is over there winding the entire time. Hey, I can't say I can't. We must make sure you understand the narratives being pushed by the left. Now, here's Morning Mika. Quite important. I think 1957 Arkansas, the desegregation fight of the, I think the high schools there, present Eisenhower called in the 101st Airborne. But he also federalized the National Guard. What you're seeing in Texas. At the same time that they're coming forward and they're coming forward with this and the bill, this and just bill the exact same time they're coming forward with the and the bill. What do you have? You have the federal government going down to the state of Texas and the state of Texas saying they're trying to protect around border. Abbott, who's no fire breather, finally calls out people to help protect the border to put razor wire up, particularly down at points like Eagle Pass, Texas. What does the federal government do? They go the Supreme Court to get a ruling that they can go and cut the bob wire and let the invaders in and process more. And remember, this entire bill that you're seeing, the Langford bill is just about processing. It's not about detention and deportation. Todd Bendvich says the 2D's detention and deportation, that's not in this bill. All this is is to process more. The federal government's down to cut the razor wire because the state of Texas protecting their sovereignty and the sovereignty of their people. And what is the morning Joe come up with right away? The time that the President of the United States in an emergency about this situation down in Arkansas in the 1950s about segregation of the schools, federalize the National Guard and they say, hey, he's not threatening to do it. He hasn't said he's going to do it, but it's a tool in the toolbox. They are absolutely sending the message, the mainstream media trying to threaten the people in the great state of Texas and other states like Kristi Nomen, other states, Oklahoma are sending their national guard troops down as support. They're saying, hey, we're going to federalize in what Abbasard said. If you federalize our National Guard to work against the people of Texas, you're going to have to report to me. It's not going to be quite so easy. There going to be many other things they can pull. Right now, this border, the invasion of our country is on absolute fire. Biden understands he has a terrible situation politically, a terrible situation politically. Here, and that is exactly why he's here saying, oh, you give me this bill. I'll shut down the border. They've held our border and our sovereignty in the sovereignty of the city's hostage so they can get $60 billion to money laundering in Ukraine. They held our border hostage for the border of Ukraine and Russia over the Russian-speaking Eastern border. Okay, we're going to take a short commercial break.",subjective

Bannon. What is to it, brother? Yeah, Steve, so we're down here in Eagle Pass, and you guys can see behind me. We got a national guard here. You can actually see him, gentlemen. He's trying to break into our country right here. So there's an illegal immigrant right there that's probably gonna get let through this razor wire right here by Border Patrol. So now that I'm out here and I got my phone out, chances are they're probably not gonna help that young man through. But when I was sitting here waiting for you to come on your show, a young lady with an infant toddler, probably about one year old, and another lady were just escorted through that razor wire by Border Patrol. So when we got here this morning, we arrived and they changed the media area. Before a media could drive all the way up, right up the wall here, now they have it blocked. So our trucks can't get even, like we're, a couple of football fields away. We have to bark, our way it goes way out there. Originally they weren't gonna let us over here. When we started flying up our drone, they sent a state trooper over to intimidate us in harass us. They had a helicopter going up and there was a helicopter in the air, so I had to take my drone down, which all they wanted was my drone to not be filming shipping containers. Because they were letting, they were helping all of the illegal immigrants break over. I mean, you can see the ladder right there. The ladder is right there up against the shipping container. So why do you have a ladder there? To help the migrants come over. So they'll dump the ladder on the other side, they'll let them climb up and then they'll help them down into America. I mean, our country's being invaded. There was at least probably 300 or 400 migrants lined up along this river bank this morning right when we got here. I'll try and to break in. And as soon as they saw my drone coming up, we would move them to this side. And then when my drone was down here, they would have them go into the other side. And then moving them back and forth. I just want to make clear to the audience, because that drone footage is so brilliant that they are, and these are American authorities are absolutely opposed to you putting, they'll come up with any excuse in the world. Oh, we're putting, you know, FB 111 up, we got helicopters going up. They come up with every excuse and different levels, federal and even state to try to make sure that your drone can't get up there and get the footage that America needs to see. Am I correct in that? 100% and I got that part on film too. I'll be posting it later. Tell me, you've been at this for a while. Is this getting worse? Or is it any, even with the wire going up and some of the, you know, Abbot and Abbot's gonna have, I think Trump come down in a week or so, is in your mind getting stabilized, getting better or is it in invasion getting worse? The invasion's getting exponentially worse. They are getting exponentially better at moving these migrants through our country. And processing, I mean, this thing is like a well-oiled machine. They register with it, they check in with the app, so the CBP app tells Border Patrol exactly where they're gonna be. So as soon as they arrive on USA, so I guess they claim asylum and then Border Patrol picks them up, deliver them to be high, which is like their first checkpoint over there where you can see the buses. I mean, there's probably 50 migrants over there as we speak, and ready to get loaded onto that bus. And then that bus will take them about a mile and a half up the road to the first processing facility. And what goes on at that facility, it's above my pay grade, it's an NGO. And then they process them and ship them wherever they wanna go in the country. Or they have their friends pick them up, they had, you know, looked like a, I don't know, a chauffeur, a guy out there and looked like what looked like a Benz yesterday picking up three migrants. I mean, some of these migrants are wearing Louis Vuitton, some are wearing Gucci. It's hard to say that these people are suffering when they're coming over here and luxury clothes. I can't even afford to buy those clothes. So it's actually a last thing, is our brave Border Patrol, it sounds like familiar reporting has been turned into a concierge service. Absolutely. Their only job down here is to play Uber for the migrants. I would say, it seems like they have no desire. I think while the patrol is coming up, they're just burnt out. Ryan, how do people get to your footage? Where do they go on social media or your site to follow your reporting down there? You can follow me on rumble and getter at Ryan Mata. And you can also follow me on Twitter at Ryan Mata Media. Ryan, great job. You'd be safe then. We're gonna put up on our platforms, Grace Chung and Captain Benz are gonna push it out right now.

Threatening to hang people. Bringing zip ties to take people hostage. Ransacking lawmakers' offices stealing things and taking a shit and smearing it on the walls. That's legitimate political discourse to the GOP. They have lost their collective minds. Between this and book burning and cameras and people's classrooms and enemies lists and voter suppression and calling to jail their political opponents, let's be very clear. The Republican party have abandoned democracy and advocated their responsibility to the American experiment. Less we forget on the day of this event, most of these same people made speeches that absolutely denigrated what had happened because it was disgusting lawless behavior and they knew it. And then they changed their tune to try to blame it on outside groups like Antifa and BLM. Then they created a conspiracy theory blaming the FBI and the deep state but voted against looking into it. And when we tried to have a bipartisan commission, they voted against it. And when we tried to set up a bipartisan committee, they refused to have any of their members sit on it. And now that we are discovering just piles of evidence that people at the highest level of command in the Republican party in the White House were involved in an active coup and this horrific attack was part of the plan. They are now officially claiming the entire thing was legitimate political discourse. This is appalling and any reasonable conservative needs to look at this and say this is not what I stand for. This is not who I am. Because the Republicans have planted their flag deep in authoritarianism where violence is power and lies are truth and the entire party operates around the cult of a leader.

Let's not mince words, they've been sold into slavery. When kids are being put into factories, forced to work overnight, forced to work in terrible conditions, they're not getting paid, they're not going to school, sometimes they're not getting fed, that's slavery. And what I heard from Secretary of New Yorkists, don't take my word for it, you go look at the record, read the transcript. What he told me was, oh, it's not my problem. We don't need anything to do with it. Not my problem. Now we have a new report from HHS, where they say, it's not their problem. Amazing how this works. Nobody's responsible. These kids are literally being sold as slaves in the United States of America in the year 2023 and nobody's responsible. They don't want to come and testify to this committee. You bet they don't. They don't want to be put under oath. They don't want to answer any questions. They don't want cameras here. They don't want to take any responsibility. Well, I tell you, it's somebody's fault. It's not the kids fault. Thank God for the New York Times, phrase I never thought would come out of my mouth. But really, I mean, thank the Lord that the New York Times did these series of reports, because otherwise we'd still be fed the lies, from this administration that everything is fine and dandy. We know just where the kids are. It's all great. They're all fine. No, it's not. Is it fine that people like Carolina Yuck, who's 15 years old, I apologize to her if I mispronounced her name. She's one of the folks, one of the young women that the New York Times caught up with. What is she doing? Midnight in Grand Rapids, Michigan, a conveyor belt carrying bags of Cheerios, past the cluster of young workers. Carolina every 10 seconds have to stuff a sealed plastic bag of cereal into a passing yellow carton. It's dangerous work, fast moving polies and gears that it torn off fingers and ripped open a woman's scalp. The factory was full of underage workers like Carolina who crossed the southern border by themselves, vulnerable. Now spending late nights, bent over hazardous machinery and violation of child labor laws. Carolina says sometimes I get tired and feel sick. Her stomach often hurt. She was unsure if that was because of the lack of sleep, the stress from the incestant roar of the machines or the worries she had for herself and her family in Guatemala. This is totally, utterly, completely unacceptable. And I am sick unto death of this administration coming before this Congress and saying, it's not our fault, we have nothing to do with it. We don't know where they are. The kids are fine, somebody will do it, somebody will get around to it, ridiculous. Let's look at some of the things that we've learned about what's going on over at HHS that Secretary Bacera is doing. Here's some quotes from employees at HHS. At least five health and human services staff members said that they were pushed out after raising concerns about child safety. This is all from the New York Times, by the way. Mr. Bacera told the Office of Refugee Resettlement Director that if she could not increase the number of discharges of children, he'd find somebody who would. Next, 20% of kids have to be released every week or you get dinged. It's a conveyor belt of children being forced through the system and what's the priority of HHS? Just get them out as fast as we can. They go to factories, they go to slave labor, no. I've written in the FBI and asked the FBI, where are the 80,000 plus children? This administration's lost. They don't know. I've said it's your responsibility to go get them. It's a direct violation of child labor laws. They're not doing anything. Nobody's doing anything. It's outrageous.

Do you know where those jobs have come from? They've come out of Midwestern towns, like the ones I represent.

Conservatism is a political philosophy that values tradition, advocates for gradual change and emphasizes the importance of maintaining social order. Rooted in a desire to preserve the wisdom of past generations, it champions the continuity of established institutions and customs. At its core, conservatism is marked by a cautious approach to societal changes, preferring evolution over revolution to ensure stability and cohesion within society. Conservatives advocate for a limited government, asserting that minimal state intervention allows for greater personal freedom and economic prosperity. Economic freedom is also a key tenant, with free market principles favored for fostering innovation and growth. In essence, conservatism is about balancing the respect for historical legacies, with the practicalities of modern governance, striving for a society that honors its past, while cautiously navigating the future.

So, in response, the Justice Department is considering the expansion of a program that allows early releases to inmate to our victims of sexual abuse behind bars. It's basically a compassionate release program. When this subcommittee did this investigation several women testified before the committee to accompany the release of this report. That report was not based just on their testimony, but it was based on numerous interviews with current and former prison officials, whistleblowers, and survivors of sexual abuse while incarcerated. The summary of the report essentially finds that the Bureau of Prisons has failed to successfully implement the Prison Rape Elimination Act. One victim testifying at that subcommittee hearing, I was going to give a trigger warning before I go into this. She testified, I was sentenced to put in prison for choices that I made. I was not sent to prison to be raped and abused. That victim was incarcerated at the facility in West Virginia where she was repeatedly assaulted by an officer working there and then was met with threats to block a transfer to a facility that was closer to her family if she resisted the assaults. Female inmates were sexually abused in 19 of the 29 federal facilities that housed female inmates and have housed them over the last 10 years. And in at least four, if not more of those federal facilities, managers failed to enforce the federal law that exists to reduce sexual assault in prisons. The report also revealed that hundreds of sexual abuse and assault charges are among the backlog of more than 8,000 internal affairs misconduct cases waiting to be investigated. Subcommittee leaders stated our findings are deeply disturbing and demonstrate that the BOP Bureau of Prisons is failing systemically to prevent detect and address sexual abuse of prisoners by its own employees. The BOP has a new director Colette S. Peters and she stated that she's begun to consider requests from inmates who are victims of sexual abuse and are not considered to be a threat if they are released. However, advocates feel that considering those cases is not enough and they are pushing the United States Sentencing Commission to give inmates the right to directly request a compassionate release ruling from trial judges instead of having to go through the Bureau.",subjective

I pull up to the gate and cops rush my vehicle. Eight cops, eight cop cars, 10 police officers, two on foot, the rest in vehicles.

You're like, you're at the NSA. Like right now, you're at the NSA. I was like, because I didn't know, I literally looked this man in his eyes, like a dumbass, and said, what's the NSA? He laughed. He laughed in my mother-fucker face and told me to pull through the gate, and ran my plates. They interrogated, but like they asked me, how the question is like, where are you coming from? Like what address did you come from? Why are you here? What are you doing all this stuff? Turns out, after they run all of my shit and everything, and I tell them what the address is, they're like, oh, you're trying to get to the military base. Yeah, no, this isn't that. You need written instructions for that, so give me a pretty out like list of like, how to get there. Well, I'm story short. I end up going to where I'm supposed to be going, but it still took me like two hours to get there, because y'all find a military base is just hard.

My name is Jacob Angelichansley and I would like to start this official statement by thanking God Almighty for protection and blessings along this arduous journey of mine. You know, I once heard that school teaches us lessons and gives us a test, but God gives us a test and teaches us lessons. And to say the least, I have most certainly learned numerous lessons during the test which God has graced me with over the last two and a half years. Now, one of the most important lessons I learned is patience. See, the world is currently going through turmoil, the lives of which many of us were not prepared for by our schools, by our governments and our cultural upbringing. However, patience is key if we are to overcome the obstacles before us and simultaneously turn them into opportunities for unity, love and peace. Now, if handled with patience and understanding, we can use these demoralizing and destabilizing crisis to emerge a more evolved and stable and moral nation species. Another important lesson I've learned along the way is the power of peace and how having an unshakable internal peace is by far the most powerful tool that we have at our immediate disposal. For you see, power, power is not about the use of external force. Instead, power is derived from having an indomitable will. If we as individuals and as nations learn to use the power of peace to resolve our conflicts, our lives and the world will take the shape of a beautiful work of art molded by gods on hand. Now, another lesson I learned I'd like to share is the strength won gains when one practices forgiveness. Now, there are many, many people who would be outraged if what happened to me had happened to them. However, outrage and anger only cloud our judgment and prevent us from seeing the very real solutions which stare us in the face. See, forgiveness alone has the potential to clarify one's thinking, to unlock one's creativity and to enable the individual to heal. Christ understood the power of forgiveness to free a person's soul, which I think is why he forgave those nailing him to the cross. So in the spirit of Christ's amc, I would like to use this official statement to make it extremely clear that I have no animosity or hatred toward the United States federal government. And I have forgiven my captors and I pray for them because that is what Christ will do. The final lesson I will share is the power that we each wield when we live by and speak the truth. See, speaking the truth can topple corrupt empires and free whole nations that have been enslaved by illusions. The Buddha once said that three things cannot be hidden long. One, moon, truth. And while there are those who will say that things in the world are only getting worse, I, a sir, things are not getting worse, but rather the truth of global corruption is simply becoming more obvious. Therefore, I encourage all those who are watching this video and hearing these words to use the truth as a tool to shape themselves in the world into a paradise that we can pass on to our children. So in summation, the pressures brought about by my journey and my ordeal have only strengthened my resolve and taught me the power that we all possess when we practice patience and forgiveness and when we find internal peace and live by the truth so that we may speak the truth without fear. Therefore, the next part of my journey entails using the power of patience and peace to spread the truth and to do so in the spirit of a Christ-like forgiveness. In closing, Gandhi once said, first they ignore you and they laugh at you and they fight you then you win. So it seems I've already undergone the first three stages of this process.

For his alleged role in a hushed money payment to Stormy Daniels weeks before the 2016 presidential election, the Manhattan Grand Juries indictment is the latest blow for the real estate Titan, whose golden pompadour and once golden property portfolio have come under public scrutiny since taking political office seven years ago. Let's take a look back at the nation's first developer in chief and his Manhattan real estate history. As Trump told the real deals editor-in-chief Stewart Elliott in a 2003 TRD cover story, I'm the biggest developer in New York. I've done that with positive thinking. Trump's trademark self-regard proved advantageous early on. After launching his real estate career with his father's company Trump Management in the late 1960s, he ventured out on his own in 1971 with the Trump Organization. In 1975, the Queen's native, then 29 years old, struck his first big Manhattan deal to purchase the Commodore Hotel, a once grand but by then ramshackle money-losing enterprise next to Grand Central Terminal. Trump's father Fred, who made his fortune building meat and potatoes middle-class housing in the burrows, likened the effort to buy the hotel to fighting for a seat on the Titanic. But Trump's artful deal-making soon emerged. Prior to signing the contract, he talked local politicians into granting him an unheard of $40-year $56-million tax abatement, and near-card blanche to reimagine the site. Trump reopened the $1,400 key hotel in 1980 as the grand high-end. The swash-buckling deal-making of the mid-1980s served as the backdrop for a man-hatten real estate free by Trump, including Trump Tower and Midtown, which opened in 1983, and Trump laws on the Upper East Side, which opened in 1984. As well as a string of Atlantic City casino hotels, Trump also bought the West Side rail yards on the Upper West Side in 1984 to build what he envisioned as television city. For a time, Trump's persona carried him to the heights of mobile-dom, until he overexcended himself and came crashing back down to Earth in the great real estate bust of the late 1980s. According to the reports of the time, Trump owed at $1.8 billion. $975-million of it personally guaranteed, but Fortune soon favored Trump. In 1988, he acquired the iconic Plaza Hotel, with $407-million borrowed from banks. He sold the landmark luxury property in 1995, but remains associated with the hotel to the present day. One of the developers crowning man-hatten achievements came in 1994 when he unveiled the Trump International Hotel in Tower in Columbus Circle. A 52-story luxury hotel and apartment complex was Trump deemed the best project in New York by a factor of 10. Trump commanded an unprecedented $1,000 per square foot for the development, shaking up the city's upper end condo market. Two years later, he bought 40 Wall Street, a 71-story skyscraper in the financial district, later rebranding it as the Trump building. He rounded out the century with the development of Trump World Tower, a 376-unit condo in Midtown's Turtle Bay that was briefly the tallest residential tower in the world. The 21st century saw Trump take on everything from golf courses to reality television, curious to hear more from the man himself?

He has admitted to soliciting and exchanging nude pics online with un-aged boys. One boy was 17, the other 15. In a statement acknowledging his guilt, Alexander wrote, quote, this is too gay, adding that he was battling with SSA or same-sex attraction. This unscientific phrase is a fundamentalist Christian conversion therapy term, meaning I feel guilty for lusting after boys. A right-wing conservative quote grew while accusing others of gruelling is hardly news. It comes with a territory. After all, modern conservatism is in a movement. It's a mask that covers gruelling, grifting, and guilt. Just ask Matt Schlapp, who runs CPAC, and recently had a gay fondling scandal of his own. While right wingers attack drag queens, their false piety is a form of conservative drag, where they play dress up to conceal their naughty and nefarious true nature. But here is where it gets interesting. Alexander was outed by gay right wing extremist Milo Yanapolis, who himself was canceled in 2017, following remarks he had made that appeared to endorse or at least downplay Pellia. Milo is lashing out now because he found himself on the outside of Kanye West's inner circle. Milo is jealous of Alexander and white supremacist Nick Frentes, who are still in with Kanye. Alexander is a close friend of Frentes, with Frentes accused of helping to cover up Alexander's predatory sexual behavior. Frentes and Alexander are both deeply involved in Donald Trump's America First Movement. Additionally, Frentes marched in the infamous white power rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. At the Snittarius march, Frentes and his fellow white power pals chanted, you will not replace us. This comes from the great replacement theory on the white often promoted by Fox News personality Tucker Carlson, that falsely claims that Jews are orchestrating a sinister plot to replace white people in America with dark skin minorities. How ironic then that this bubbling scandal involves a jealous gay man outing another gay man and his white supremacist friend Nick Frentes so he could return to the posse of a black rapper. So Frentes' buddies are two gay dudes, one with the birth name Ali Akbar and an African-American hip hop star. Guess what Frentes? Your white buddies have been replaced by you. Oddly, your friend circle looks like the group I went to gay pride with last June. You promote enough diversity to satisfy an Ivy League gender studies program. The Daily Beast reports, quote, Alexander who has described as ethnicity as half black and half Arab and says he's bisexual might seem like an unusual ally for the invowedly racist and homophobic America First Movement. You reckon? But the more you think about it, the modern conservative movement is a front and a fraud. It's about deflection and projection. What binds all of these phonies together is a contradictory worship of family values and love of Donald Trump. These family loving religious men support Trump who was just fingerprinted in Manhattan because he botched paying off a porn actress in which he cheated on his wife shortly after she gave birth. Kanye West himself is divorced, a strange from his children and runs a shady, unaccredited school in a Los Angeles suburb called Donda Academy. The school's former principal, Bula McLoyd, told Rolling Stone, quote, as an educator with over 22 years of experience in the field. I always put children at the forefront of any decision I make. Consequently, I moved on. McLoyd's words are symbolic of the entire modern conservative movement. It claims to care about children but often exploits them in every opportunity. It's full of cranks, creeps and cons that publicly profess moral purity while living putrid personal lives.",subjective

My name is Jacob Angelichancle and I would like to start this official statement by thanking God Almighty for protection and blessings along this arduous journey of mine. You know, I once heard that school teaches us lessons and gives us the tests, but God gives us the tests and teaches us lessons. And to say the least, I most certainly learned numerous lessons during the test which God has graced me with over the last two and a half years. Now one of the most important lessons I learned was patience. See, the world is currently going through turmoil, the lives of which many of us were not prepared for by our schools, by our governments and our cultural upbringing. However, patience is key if we are to overcome the obstacles before us and simultaneously turn them into opportunities for unity, love and peace. Now if handled with patience and understanding, we can use these demoralizing and destabilizing crisis to emerge a more evolved and a stable and moral nation species. Another important lesson I've learned along the way is the power of peace and how having an unshakable internal peace is by far the most powerful tool that we have at our immediate disposal. For you see, power is not about the use of external force. Instead, power is derived from having an indomitable will. If we as individuals and as nations learn to use the power of peace to resolve our conflicts, our lives and the world will take the shape of a beautiful work of art molded by God's own hand. Now another lesson I learned I'd like to share is the strength won gains when one practices forgiveness. Now there are many, many people who would be outraged if what happened to me had happened to them. However, outrage and anger only cloud our judgment and prevent us from seeing the very real solutions which scare us in the face. See, forgiveness alone has the potential to clarify one's thinking to unlock one's creativity and to enable the individual to heal. Christ understood the power of forgiveness to free a person's soul which I think is why he forgave those nailing him to the cross. So, in the spirit of Christ's example, I would like to use this official statement to make it extremely clear that I have no animosity or hatred toward the United States federal government. And I have forgiven my captors and I prayed for them because that is what Christ would do. The final lesson I will share is the power that we each wield when we live by and speak the truth. See, speaking the truth can topple corrupt empires and free whole nations that have been enslaved by illusions. The Buddha once said that three things cannot be hidden long. The Sun, the Moon, and the Truth. And while there are those who will say that things in the world are only getting worse, I assert things are not getting worse. But rather, the truth of global corruption is simply becoming more obvious. Therefore, I encourage all those who are watching this video and hearing these words to use the truth as a tool to shape themselves in the world into a paradise that we can pass on to our children. So, in summation, the pressures brought about by my journey and my ordeal have only strengthened my resolve and taught me the power that we all possess when we practice patience and forgiveness and when we find internal peace and live by the truth so that we may speak the truth without fear. Therefore, the next part of my journey entails using the power of patience and peace to spread the truth and to do so in the spirit of a Christ-like forgiveness. In closing, God once said, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win. So, it seems I've already undergone the first three stages of this process. Now, all there's left to do is win. Remember, knowledge always overcomes power.",subjective

That's built into the TV. So what we can prove here is that with a little bit of extra code, we can turn the camera on in your browser. Wow. And while this is evident to you right here, because we, because we've designed it that way, this is something that we can do invisibly. And actually, I have the camera running behind the web page that you're, that you're looking at. So what this means is I could be sitting here watching TV from my, from my bedroom. And you could be anywhere in the world looking at this image of me watching. Yep. I could be sitting on a laptop in a cafe in Paris. And as long as I have a network connection, I'd be able to get into your TV and access the camera. The kind of scary things about it is that it doesn't actually give any indication that the camera's on. And there's no little LED that shows up when the camera's on. So we could actually be watching you and you never even know. What is a smart TV? And why is it a playground essentially for hackers? It's a computer. So instead of just being a tube and some other electronics, now it has a web browser. And it has a lot of devices running Linux. But the real danger is when people start using smart TVs for things like online banking, we can take a popular bank address and translate that into a different IP address, to a site that directs to a site that we control. So it may look like your bank's login, but you're actually entering a user and a password that goes to us instead of your bank. In a statement to CNN Money, Samsung says it takes consumer privacy very seriously. The camera can be turned into the bezel of the TV so that the lens is covered or disabled by pushing the camera inside the bezel. The TV owner can also unplug the TV from the home network when the smart TV features are not in use. As an added precaution, we also recommend that customers use encrypted wireless access points when using connected devices. For those of us who are a little freaked out and maybe don't trust all these updates, what's the easiest fix?

McCarthy strongly denied those remarks, but then the New York Times posted the audio recordings. Here's ABC's Chief Washington correspondent Jonathan Carr. When the New York Times reported that Republican leader Kevin McCarthy was so outraged by Donald Trump's behavior on January 6th that he wanted him to resign, McCarthy flatly denied it, calling the report, quote, totally false and wrong. But now the reporters behind the story have presented proof McCarthy's own voice. Here talking about Trump on a call with Republican leaders four days after the attack on the Capitol. And I've had it with this guy. And a day later McCarthy said this in a call with House Republicans. But let me be very clear to all of you and I've been very clear to the president. He bears responsibilities for his words and actions, no offense or buts. I ask him personally today, does he hold responsibility for what happened? Does he feel bad about what happened? He told me he does have some responsibility for what happened. And he need to acknowledge that. The tape is from New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns backing up reporting from their forthcoming book, This Will Not Pass. When they first reported this week that McCarthy told fellow Republicans he planned to call Trump and tell him he should resign. The Republican leader spokesperson claimed, quote, McCarthy never said he'd call Trump to say he should resign. But listen to the tape. McCarthy first talks about the certainty of impeachment passing the House and maybe the Senate and even raises the possibility of Pence pardoning Trump if he resigned. When I think I'm going to do, I'm going to call him. This is what I think. He's already passed the House. I think there's a chance you'll pass the Senate or even really go. I think there's a lot of different limitations for that. Now, I haven't had a discussion with them that if you get resigned, would it not happen? Now, this is one personal fear I have.

And the interesting thing is Jesus said it would be this way, said the 11 of bad religion would take away eyes to see and ears to hear from followers of that religion. And Jeremiah and the Hebrew scripture said, don't listen to those prophets who say God wants to make our country great again, but know that we are in trouble because we've forgotten how to take care of the poor, the foreigner, the marginalized and the economically disadvantaged. So when a God follower chooses to follow this guy instead of reality, it's actually just history repeating itself. So how do we avoid falling into the trap of that echo chamber that makes us believe somebody like Rudy Giuliani over real live truth? And dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of court cases? Well, the Bible talks about open-heartedness versus hard-heartedness. Open-heartedness is when you have a powerful identity that says, I can hear things that disagree with the dogma and indoctrination of my community. Because I care about truth more than inclusion in an exclusive group or sect. Christianity browbeats people into conformity to the message and defending even up to the case of dissonance. But when we open our heart and say we want to learn, have our mind renewed as it says in Romans 12, then we start to know what is good and right and true. And the Bible calls this wisdom that we should want more than gold or silver. If you have relatives stuck in Mago world and believe Rudy Giuliani or Tucker Carlson, there's not a lot you can do other than fight for your own identity and let your transformation be reflected to those around you. And just display what it looks like to pursue truth even when it disagrees with what you believe.",subjective

Nice to see you again. When you were here last, I talked with you about the fact that more than 130 officials in the Energy Department reported more than 2,700 trades of shares, bonds, and options and companies that ethics officers said was directly related to the agency's work. This is institutionalized corruption. And I asked you, Point Blank, do you own any individual stock? And you told me, no, let's just look at it. There's not a difficult question. Do you own individual stocks, Madam Secretary? You said no. In fact, you repeated it three times to me. No, no, no. Turns out that was false. You did own multiple individual stocks. And you neglected to report it to this committee for months afterwards. Why did you mislead this committee? Oh, my goodness. That was exactly my response. So why did you mislead this committee? I believed that I had sold all individual stocks. And I was incorrect. So I came back and told you just don't know the portfolio. Pretty much. It's a big one, I guess, huh? No, it's extremely small. Apparently not. Someone manages it for you. So I came back as soon as I found out that in fact I had not sold all individuals. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, that's not true either. Let's just look at the timeline. Let's not, I just remind you, you're under oath. As a secretary, you testified, you didn't own any individual stocks. You didn't sell the stocks for a whole other month. And after you sold the stocks, you waited another month before you informed this committee. Why did you mislead us? And what were you hiding? Why did you wait so long? Why did you hide this? I did not hide it because I brought it forth to the committee when I realized that we had made a mistake. Really? What explains the delay? Why did you wait for a full month to explain your actions to this committee, your false testimony? That's less than a month. And I sent a letter explaining what had happened. May the 15th to the 9th. May the 15th to the 9th. Are we going to... I owned a Ford stock that was... You mislead this committee and you wait, what were the stocks? What were the stocks that you owned? It was a Ford stock that my husband had owned since he was very young. And I just was not aware of it. And what were the others? You sold six stocks, what were the other five? I sold non-conflicting stocks. What were they? I don't honestly, I don't even know. I do know they're a Ford one because that was a conflict. That's why I wrote this. You're here before this committee a year later after actively misleading to us, after denying and delaying and delaying. And now you won't tell us. Is one of them Protera? No. You said on the board of directors at Protera, you made millions in end reports and stock options at Protera. And then you promoted Protera stock and Protera products as energy secretary. Was that one of the stocks that you sold? This is so... I mean, really? Was that one of the stocks you sold? No. Yes, really. You are presiding over institutionalized corruption in your energy department. You have violated the stock act nine separate times. You have been referred by the Inspector General for violations of the Hatch Act. It is institutionalized corruption that you are now the face of. And here's what I'm trying to figure out. I just want to know who really runs the energy department. Is it you? Or is it the mega corporations who stock that you own that you're making profits at? Oh my goodness. Or maybe it's the foreign billionaires who fund your conferences. Let's try something else. Do you know the names of the foreign billionaires who fund the conferences you go to? Since you don't know the stocks, do you know the names of the foreign billionaires? This is unbelievable to me. Let me help you. One of them is Hatch Org Wice, a Swiss billionaire who has used various dark money front groups. I do not know what you are talking about. Who funnel various dark money's front groups to funnel foreign money into American politics. He has used the Berger Action Fund, 20 million dollars, that then sent money to the fund for a better future, that then sent money to the climate power group that has funded conferences you've attended. Do you know who this is? Do you think it's a good idea to know who that is? I have no idea which is not. I have no idea what you're talking about. You don't know the stocks, you don't know the billionaires, you would take no responsibility. In short, meanwhile, your energy department executives in your energy department are trading stocks and companies that they have direct oversight over and you work too. That is incorrect. Nobody in the department of energy and we have a strong ethics office does not trade stocks in anything that they have oversight over. That is not true. It is not true. The Wall Street Journal has reported on this. If I may. If I may, Senator, if I may just ask the question, is it possible that maybe we can continue this at a later time, but if you had any questions on the energy direct energy policies? Mr. Chairman, this is directly relevant to institutionalized corruption in the department of energy that she oversees. You are, I think, about to say that the Wall Street Journal reports wrong. The Wall Street Journal report did not say that people over whom they were in areas where they were directly overseeing head stocks. They did not. Our ethics office consults with all of our employees that have a recording requirement about their stock holdings. They do not own stocks in areas that they have any influence over nor do I. Madam Secretary, all I have to say is this record is just deplorable. It is despicable. It is outrageous that hundreds of officers in the energy department are trading shares. It is outrageous that you misled us. It is outrageous that you are continuing to mislead us. It is outrageous you're going to conferences and events funded by foreign billionaires using dark money to try to influence our politics. This has got to change. And frankly, you should go. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",subjective

Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand congresswoman known for her controversial statements, has just dropped a bombshell announcement that has left the internet buzzing. In a surprising turn of events, Marjorie Taylor Greene has revealed that she is pregnant. But here's the twist that nobody saw coming. She claims that the father of her unborn child is none other than the former president himself. Donald Trump. Yes, you heard that right. Marjorie Taylor Greene has publicly declared that she is expecting a baby with Donald Trump, sending social media into a frenzy of speculation and disbelief. The news has left many scratching their heads and others gasping in shock. While some may dismiss this revelation, as a mere publicity stunt, or a wild hoax, the implications are nothing short of extraordinary. Imagine the former leader of the free world allegedly fathering a child with a controversial congresswoman known for her unwavering support. Predictably, Trump has wasted no time in vehemently denying the claim, calling Marjorie Taylor Greene's announcement a diabolical lie and threatening legal action against her. He insists that their relationship is purely professional and accuses her of trying to tarnish his reputation. It emits the chaos and confusion, one question looms large. Is there any truth to Marjorie Taylor Greene's shocking revelation? Could this be a case of political intrigue, a scandalous affair, or perhaps just a cleverly orchestrated prank? As the nation waits with baited breath for further developments, one thing is for certain. Marjorie Taylor Greene's pregnancy bombshell has ignited a firestorm of controversy that shows no signs of a baiting.

Steve Bannon is a man who's rebranded racism as nationalism, and now he is Trump's chief strategist, and he was a key player in getting the Donald into the White House. Hey, I'm Tarrick, and we're gonna walk you through how someone with such a low profile and ties to white supremacy, rose to become one of the most powerful men in the United States. After years in preps school and later graduating from Virginia Tech, Bannon enlisted in the military, where he served from the late 70s to early 80s. During this time, Bannon grew disillusioned with then-president Jimmy Carter. He felt Carter's sole focus in the Persian Gulf was aimed towards protecting U.S. oil interests from the nation's Cold War enemy, the Soviet Union. But in 1980, there was a turning point in U.S. politics. California Governor Ronald Reagan came to power after inspiring millions with the slogan, let's make America great again. Sound familiar? Bannon left the Navy in 1983 to pursue his MBA at Harvard. He would eventually find his way to one of the biggest financial firms on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs. Bannon left the banking giant to start his own firm, Bannon and Co. The upstart connected big money financiers with huge Hollywood projects. And then 9-11-Hound. Bannon threw all of his energy into producing and directing his own documentaries. But these weren't your average Netflix movies. The liberal media don't matter to me, Republican establishment don't matter to me. To hell with the establishment, because the establishment is put us in this position for twice. From 2004 to 2012, Bannon directed nine films. His inspiration, Nazi propaganda filmmaker Lenny Riefenstahl. Riefenstahl collaborated with Adolf Hitler in the 1900s to create films glorifying the Nazi party. Throughout his career, Bannon's colleagues have described his work ethic as very intense. And parts of his personal life were just as intense. Bannon was married a few times, his second life was Mary Louise Picard. She made headlines when reporters dug up a domestic violence report that she filed in 1996. Several years later, Steve and Mary Louise divorced and he married Diane Clohessie. Diane was an activist for a new political presence growing across the US, the T-Point. Bannon identified with the group's mistrust in federal government and agreed with rolling back social welfare programs. Steve and Diane also called it quits, ending their marriage in 2009. That same year, Barack Obama was sworn in as the first black president and the T-party hit the national stage. During the 2010 midterm elections, Bannon released a film Battle for America to fire up T-party supporters. I shudder to imagine what an unchecked, unlimited, Obama radicalism would be like in the next two years. He has truly awakened to sleeping giant to a point where they are determined to take back America. And Bannon's films were effective. Combined with the landmark Supreme Court case citizens united, T-party backed Republicans one big. 44 seats to be exact. In 2011, Bannon met Andrew Breitbart and the two became fast friends. Now, Breitbart.com was a conservative news organization that panned her to people who felt that Fox News was the establishment. Andrew Breitbart died in 2012. Steve Bannon took over and helped amplify anti-black, anti-Muslim, and anti-immigrant sentiment. He used Breitbart to cater to white supremacists. In that same year,",subjective

I can't believe this is real, it's real. This is the Republican Attorney General of Texas, his name is Ken Paxton, although he is not currently serving as Attorney General because he has been suspended from office by the Texas legislature pending an impeachment trial. Now how bad do things have to be for the Republicans in the Texas legislature to impeach their own Republican Attorney General? Well, where do we start? Almost the entire time he's been Attorney General, he's been under indictment for felony securities fraud. Meanwhile, he's facing potential disbarment from the practice of law entirely over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Also he's under criminal investigation by the U.S. Justice Department on serious corruption allegations. Allegations so serious that eight high-ranking officials in his own office went to the FBI to report what they had witnessed in his office. Earlier this year, Paxton reached a multi-million dollar settlement in a lawsuit for allegedly firing several of those officials as retaliation for them going to the FBI. It has been a lot with this guy, but hilariously, it was only when Paxton demanded that Texas taxpayers fork over the millions of dollars to pay that settlement that Republicans in the legislature finally started to get a little bit cranky with him. The Texas House impeached Ken Paxton by an overwhelming margin. So that means the Texas Senate now has to put him on trial. They'll hold an impeachment trial in September. If he's convicted at that Senate impeachment trial, he will lose his job permanently. Now here's where it gets amazing. That trial will be presided over by the president of the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor of the State, a man named Dan Patrick. As the presiding judge overseeing Paxton's impeachment trial, he'll have immense power. He'll be the ultimate arbiter of the rules and the admissibility of evidence and all that stuff. Here's the thing I can't believe is real, but it is. So Dan Patrick, the guy who's the presiding judge in this impeachment trial, just had to release his new campaign finance report. And would you look at that? He just received three million dollars from the Ken Paxton Superback. Wow, what a coincidence. Dan Patrick isn't even up for reelection until 2026.

I have four children and nine grandchildren. On the night of April the 2nd, 2016, my family got a phone call that would change our lives forever. My ex has been answered the phone and let out a blood curdling scream, a scream of pain from the depths of his soul. He screamed, he cried, he's gone, he is gone. Our 19 year old son, Emmanuel, went to a party early that night. After we got the call, we was frantic. We called his phone, no one answered. We called even the police. I went to Facebook and I had to ask, is my son dead? I found out that he was shot point blank in the head and killed while playing dominoes. No one spoke up for weeks and the killer was on the run. No one was going to snitch, but that is the street life. Words can't describe how hard it is the very a child. I ate for anyone and all who have done the same. My son, deaf, was a result of a criminal with an evil heart and a justice system felon to hold him accountable for the laws he had already broken. You see, a convicted felon killed my son with an illegally obtained gun. Our gun control lobbyists and politicians claim that their policies will save lives and reduce violence. Well, those policies did not save my son. The laws being discussed are already implemented. In cities across this country, we have decades of evidence proven they do not work. St. Louis, New York, Chicago, Washington, Atlanta, our gun control utopias, and they are plagued with the most violence. Ten more laws, 20 more laws, 1,000 more won't make what has already illegal, more wrong, or stop criminals from committing these crimes. And y'all are delusional if you think it's going to keep us safe. I am a walking testimony of how the criminal justice system and the gun control laws, which estates in racism, by the way, have failed the black community. By the age of 25, I had already went to 18 young black men funeral at the age of 25. I have one black man in jail, one black man in the grave, and my young grandson going to be raised without a father. And it's a curse on the black community. And everyone else is.",subjective

Since the horrific terrorist attacks committed by Hamas against innocent people in Israel a few weeks ago, we've been working around the clock to support our partners there and to protect Americans here at home. We assess that the actions of Hamas and its allies will serve as an inspiration the likes of which we haven't seen since ISIS launched its so-called caliphate several years ago. In just the past few weeks, multiple foreign terrorist organizations have called for attacks against Americans and the West. Al-Qaeda issued its most specific call to attack the United States in the last five years. ISIS urged its followers to target Jewish communities in the United States and Europe. Hezbollah has publicly expressed its support for Hamas and threatened to attack U.S. interests in the Middle East. And we've seen an increase in attacks on U.S. military bases overseas carried out by militia groups backed by Iran. Here in the United States, our most immediate concern is that violent extremists, individuals or small groups will draw inspiration from the events in the Middle East to carry out attacks against Americans going about their daily lives. That includes not just homegrown violent extremists inspired by a foreign terrorist organization, but also domestic violent extremists targeting Jewish or Muslim communities. We've already seen that with the individual we arrested last week in Houston who'd been studying how to build bombs and posted online about his support for killing Jews. And with the tragic killing of a six-year-old Muslim boy in Illinois and what we're investigating is a federal hate crime. But as I said a few moments ago, on top of the homegrown violent extremists and domestic violent extremists threat, we also cannot and do not discount the possibility that Hamas or another foreign terrorist organization may exploit the current conflict to conduct attacks here on our own soil. We have kept our sights on Hamas and have multiple ongoing investigations into individuals affiliated with that foreign terrorist organization. And while historically our Hamas cases have identified individuals located here who are facilitating and financing Hamas' terrorism overseas, we're continuing to scrutinize our intelligence to assess how the threat may be evolving. But it's not just Hamas. As the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, the Iranians, for instance, have directly, or by hiring criminals, mounted assassination attempts against dissidents and high-ranking current and former U.S. government officials, including right here on American soil.",subjective

Your record in your state and your leadership was incredible but something happened and I remind you you are under oath but did you say that you would not show up to this hearing if we had another panel focused on the community? I never said that. Again, and maybe we need to clarify, you are not aware of your office asking for us not to have a second panel dealing with community issues. I am not aware of that, Senator. I find that surprising given what I have heard and frankly the things I have heard from your office this last couple of weeks have been extraordinarily frustrating. I am trying not to take them personally. I am just one senator from what I have heard. You don't give a damn what I think but I will tell you this, the work and the obligations that you have are critical and what is the C stand for in the cops program? Community. Right. And do you think under oath that it would be really important that this committee have a panel hearing from community stakeholders about this program? I do and I thought that was the case and I couldn't agree more with you, Senator, that C is in the word cops because community are part of policing and the word public is in public safety for that reason as well. And you know from your experience, again, everything I review, you are extraordinary public safety official with a career to be really proud of. Thank you, Senator. And yet right now my concern is with a program I support that I want to see reauthorize that I'm grateful to hear Lindsey Graham talk about modernizing the program. The frustrations I've had over the last week with your office is just understanding what metrics you keep. Now you were a leader of police force. I let a city data, transparency, accountability, the sophistication of your metrics is vital for public safety, is it not? It is. And Senator, I want to stress the importance of you getting the information and data you need. So I'm glad you're saying this right now under oath, but I, I, I, Democrat Republican presidents I haven't had the kind of frustrations and heard the things I've heard from agencies like I have over years, last couple of weeks. You talk about de-confliction grants. What data do you collect to see if those grants are effective? So there have been many researchers and studies done over the years. I came into this assignment in January of 23. But I, I, so in the last year and quarter is your organization as a guy who understands a leadership and I know this from looking at your record, the importance of collecting data and having public transparency, does your office collect data when it comes to the de-confliction grants you have about use of force, about civilian complaints, about incidents of misconduct? Do you look at the before and after of the grants that you're giving out, critical data that would help us understand if the millions of dollars, we are putting hundreds of millions of dollars, we're putting this program are actually effective. So, so, Senator, we do have quarterly and semi annual financial progress reports, progress reports from these agencies that we review on a routine basis throughout that year, throughout the grant period. We are not an investigative agent. So you're not, but you're giving out grants that have specific ends and you've given Congress no transparency, no data to understand whether the money we're investing is producing the results. The information I have been able to get from your, from your office, the public information says that you barely do 10% of reviews of the grantees that get the resources, that you're barely collecting the kind of data on, on the various mission of your organization that would give us some kind of clarification if we're making investments that are reaping results. I agree with Senator Graham, we need to modernize the collection of data because in the last two weeks, I have been utterly frustrated to understand what your office is doing besides counting the numbers of police officers that are hired with the grants, which is vital and why I support this program, why I have voted for its historic funding, but as two men who have been responsible for the safety of our communities and understand the urgency and importance of connections to community, of building trust between law enforcement and community, I know that transparency matters and I know that accountability matters. You're not to manage these departments you give grants to, but you have an obligation for the taxpayer money that you're giving out to make sure it's making some progress towards its mission. This is to me vital for the success of this program and sir, it's vital for me because this is great as my police department is and as much as the change that they've made, I still live in a black and brown community where the number one issue in my community is public safety, where I still even as a result of the last year have shootings in my community where my family lives. And so I know what drives change as do you because I've read everything I can about your career. When you are in law enforcement, you demand a transparency, you demand the data, you demand accountability, you demand real methods to build community trust. Why now do we have an agency like yours that doesn't collect the most basic things that we would need to inform a real authorization of this program? And I think Mr. Chairman, my time is up, but we need to put in this grant things that will modernize this program so we have more transparency and accountability for the money we're giving out. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",subjective

At the U.S. Capitol the Senate and the House of Representatives come together to discuss, debate and deliberate national policy; develop consensus; and craft the country‚Äôs laws. As the nation has grown so has the U.S. Capitol: today it covers well over 1.5 million square feet, has over 600 rooms, and miles of corridors. It is crowned by a magnificent white dome that overlooks the city of Washington and has become a widely recognized icon of the American people and government. The U.S. Capitol‚Äôs design was selected by President George Washington in 1793 and construction began shortly thereafter. The U.S. Capitol is among the most architecturally impressive and symbolically important buildings in the world. It has housed the meeting chambers of the Senate and the House of Representatives for over two centuries. Begun in 1793, the U.S. Capitol has been built, burnt, rebuilt, extended and restored; today, it stands as a monument not only to its builders but also to the American people and their government. In addition to its active use by Congress, the U.S. Capitol is a museum of American art and history. Each year, it is visited by an estimated 3-5 million people from around the world. Today, the U.S. Capitol covers a ground area of 175,170 square feet, or about 4 acres, and has a floor area of approximately 16-1/2 acres. Its length, from north to south, is 751 feet 4 inches; its greatest width, including approaches, is 350 feet. Its height above the base line on the east front to the top of the Statue of Freedom is 288 feet. The building contains approximately 540 rooms and has 658 windows (108 in the dome alone) and approximately 850 doorways.
