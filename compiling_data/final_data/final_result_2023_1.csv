I'm angry because I want justice for them. I personally don't have social media and I think part of it does have to do with me seeing people dying and kids suffering and mothers crying over their sons dead bodies. It takes a toll on a person, 100% especially when you can relate because it's a different factor from if you're an American seeing stuff going on in a foreign nation or if you're a Palestinian seeing something happen to your people.

She said they were pulled off a plane and held by airport security and police at the airport last night on their way home from a wedding and were not allowed to leave after questioning because a white woman, I'll show you the picture in a minute, on board, felt scared and told the airline my brother and his friend were suspicious for taking turns using the bathroom and claimed they had made a bomb threat directly to her. Obviously that is an exceptionally serious accusation. My brother and cousin were speaking in Arabic and English and wearing Palestinian eclases, they are in their 20s. In addition, security took several other Arabic speaking and Muslim passengers off the plane for questioning and held them, preventing them from leaving as well. They were all racially profiled and treated as suspects. This included people that did not know her brother or cousin in any way. After about an hour, security police realized there was no basis to the woman's claims and they say she was lying and so they sent everyone home. They refused to give my brother the name of the woman and refused to allow him to file a police report against her for filing a false complaint. The police told my brother to just go home, there's nothing to report on. It's a she said he said situation. Only what she said was they're making a bomb. They said they have a bomb. But this woman put my brother and our cousins and Arabic speaking passengers in danger. Anyone on the plane could have reacted to her allegations and become violent. I don't see anyone having a gun on the plane other than like authorities, but it could have gone bad for sure. He, our cousin and other Arabic speaking passengers were treated as suspects because they're Palestinian Americans and this is without a doubt the result of mainstream corporate media, dehumanizing Palestinian victims in Gaza, so on and so forth. And she doesn't know who the woman and her daughter are, so she made this post with their pictures. She said we still don't know this woman's name and would like help identifying her. This is the main woman and this being her daughter who later she alleged was the one who said they made statements about having a bomb that she was the one who made that claim. Now, when I first saw this I started to look for them and I was planning a video, but people already found them and who one of them is makes it worse because update on their identities and one of them is a cop. The one who allegedly said oh they made threats of having a bomb is actually a police officer. So there is her mother Jenny Lufd Larson seen here and then her daughter who is a police officer who's originally identified as Haley Larson. However, her last name actually seems to be Huffs and she's a deputy investigator for the Anoka County Sheriff's Office in Minnesota. I have a question. If you are at an airport and you make a joke about having a bomb or they're being a bomb, it's taken very, very seriously. You can actually be put on the no-fly list for making jokes about it. Filing a false police report is serious anyway. If you're at an airport and you claim someone else has a bomb or made statements about having a bomb and that is false I would think that's even more serious. But how serious is it when that person isn't just the average citizen who you could chalk it up to being scared or paranoid or whatever, but they're a member of law enforcement who made those claims falsely. I'm just asking a question. I think everyone who sees this video on these posts is asking and I would love if someone could answer for me. But based on nothing more than the hearsay of two white women, these two young men as well as multiple others who basically were seen as Brown and Muslim were pulled off of a flight. They were treated as suspects. They were interrogated and then even after it was clear that there was nothing that there was no validity to these claims, they were prevented from traveling. Shame on the Minneapolis airport. Shame on security there and shame on that police department for doing this to these people. This is the kind of shit that we used to see after 9-11. We're not doing this again.",subjective

Well, the settlers in the West Bank have done a great job making it impossible for them to harvest their oil. They're all oil.

In terms of its content, the draft is seriously out of balance and confuses right and wrong in terms of the approach. The draft was introduced, in haste, and lacked the consensus it deserved in terms of its effectiveness, the draft does not reflect the world's strongest cause for ceasefire. It does not help to resolve the issue based on the above. The draft text is evidently not in a position to be adopted. To those who voted against this resolution, I must say that your decision shocks me to my core. If any of your countries endured a similar massacre, I am certain that you would act with much greater force than Israel. Much greater force, how would Moscow react if terrorists' death squads wiped out entire neighborhoods in Moscow? How would Beijing respond? If General Saider-Jihadis beheaded and murdered your babies, I will give you a moment to reflect on that thought. I only wanted to say my distinguished PR of Israel, having a debate with Israel was not my intention. That Israel treats China as a rival. Either as a rival. You picked the wrong target, probably. You should be aware that from the very start of this round of conflict between Palestine and Israel, China has unequivocally condemned all acts that harm civilians in violation of international law. When we refer to civilians, they include both Palestinian civilians and those of Israel. Second, regarding today's resolutions, you made some comments. I would like to remind you that just last week, this Council, there was a resolution before the Council which condemned elements, condemned hummus, attacks, China voted in favor of the resolution. However, that resolution was vetoed. But in my earlier statement, I made it abundantly clear that China is not denying Israel's legitimate concerns. However, we emphasise equal attention to the legitimate security concerns and legitimate rights of both Palestine and Israel in the current circumstances. China, we try to deal properly with this round of the conflict between Palestine and Israel. We cannot deny that the rights of the Palestinian people have for a very long time not been properly guaranteed. And the only way out we believe is the two-state resolution, but that has not been properly settled. Let's be frank, let's be honest, face up to facts and put aside differences and join forces to handle well the prevailing issues and also to chart a path whereby both Palestinians and Israelis can live in harmony, tranquility, peace and happiness.

In some places it's as high as 8 meters, making it twice the height of the Berlin Wall. It runs 280 miles long, basically the distance between Philadelphia and Boston. Oh, and according to the International Court of Justice, this wall is completely illegal. I'm in the occupied West Bank, where Palestinians have been living under Israeli military occupations since 1967. The wall is one of the most imposing parts of that occupation. Israel began building the wall in the early 2000s during a wave of suicide bombings that targeted Israelis. The Israeli government calls it the separation barrier or the security fence and says the aim is to keep out Palestinian attackers. But thousands of Palestinians still managed to get across every day looking for work. So if the wall doesn't stop people from crossing, then what does it do? Let's take a look at the root of the wall. You think a wall meant to stop people from entering its territory would be built on Israel's border, but 85% of it is inside the occupied West Bank on Palestinian land. International law says it's illegal to build settlements like these on occupied territory. But this is one of over 200 settlements and settler outposts housing half a million Israelis in the occupied West Bank. Technically these settlers live outside of Israel proper, but the wall has shifted the boundary between Israel and the West Bank to swallow up more Palestinian land. When the wall is completed, an area the size of Chicago will have been added to the Israeli side of the wall. While settlers who live west of the wall are full Israeli citizens with rights and benefits, the Palestinians who live in that same territory have none. This is the village of Daba near Conquilia. It's just one of many Palestinian villages that lost at least half of its land to the wall. Israel used dynamite to clear the path for the wall, damaging homes and the local school. In some parts the wall is made of concrete and in other parts it's fencing depending on the proximity to Palestinian homes. I'm standing at a gate that Israel only opens once a year to allow villagers to harvest their olives, which was once their main source of livelihood. What happens when the wall cuts right through a neighborhood? This entire Palestinian village called Hizma has been walled off from the rest of Jerusalem except for the homes of a couple of Palestinian families that got stuck on the Israeli side of the wall. And people here aren't even allowed to go visit their old neighbors. Hizma is technically part of Jerusalem, meaning it's on Israel to provide the villagers services like trash pick up and security, but it doesn't. And the villagers are basically forced to fend for themselves. You think the biblical city of Bethlehem would have a booming tourism industry, but here you can find one of the clearest examples of how the wall has devastated the Palestinian economy. Many businesses have shut down and families have left. When it's completed Bethlehem will be completely cut off from its agricultural land, its churches, and more. The wall along with a series of illegal Israeli settlements are physically strangling the city and it can't expand. And because of the wall most Palestinians coming from Bethlehem cannot take this road to nearby Jerusalem. You can only get through this checkpoint if you have a special permit which most Palestinians can't get. So there you have it. This wall, a fixture of the occupation, has destroyed neighborhoods, strangled the economy, and illegally grabbed more Palestinian land. Palestinians call it the apartheid wall. And the question is how long will it stand?",subjective

BDS attempts to delegitimate Israel, mainly by promoting and campaigning for action against Israel, mainly at universities. BDS campaigns are focused on shutting down dialogue and engagement to advance a zero-sum solution to a very complicated geopolitical challenge. BDS is anti-Semitic. It is ultimately not about changing Israeli policies, but ending Israel's existence as a democratic and Jewish state. It dehumanizes Israel and their supporters often using rhetoric and imagery that evokes anti-Semitism. BDS divides us. BDS at Binghamton will have little to no effect other than ostracizing students and making campus more unsafe. BDS called the October 7th Massacre, Rape, and Kidnapping, Heroic, and Reasonable. And then, after claiming they were hacked, they call it a powerful armed reaction. BDS is not about human rights or a better future. It's about destroying the Israel state. Supporting BDS means aligning yourself with a genocidal terrorist organization that has committed worse atrocities than ISIS.

And if you don't know, this is the party in Benjamin Netnahu, the current prime minister of Israel. The preamble starts off pretty strong by letting people know that Jewish people have the right to this land. They are not disputing it regardless of what your history books say. They are not disputing this whatsoever and that they have the right to security and peace. And then it goes on to explain that Zionism is a liberation movement of the Jewish people and its fulfillment is at the top of the list of the priorities for the Israeli government. Now before I go any further, it's very important that you understand dog whistles because a lot of what they're saying here is not going to be overtly apparent, okay? But we know in America that our dog whistles are typically related to things like law and order, stop and frisk, the war on drugs. So the three main dog whistles that I pulled from this document are security and peace, control over Palestinians and control over the water resources. I'm going to drop to operative two because it explicitly explains what the Palestinian obligation is towards peace and the avoidance of terror and incitement. But it doesn't explain what the Israeli obligation is towards avoiding things like terror and incitement towards the Palestinians. It's just not there. It's very one-sided. Now operative three is very telling because we are familiar with what happens in the West Bank regarding the occupation. But it says the government of Israel will enable the Palestinians to manage their lives freely within the framework of self-government. And then I'll skip around and it says the government will oppose the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. And then we have number four sources of employment for Palestinians will be developed in the autonomous areas to reduce the number of Palestinian workers in the Israeli market. As an American, that totally aligns with something that our Republican Party would say. Operative number five, Jewish settlements, security areas, water resources, the state land and road intersections in Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip shall remain under full Israeli control. Number seven is pretty deep because we know that a lot of Palestinians are not allowed into Jerusalem. United and undivided Jerusalem is the capital of the state of Israel. Activities which undermine the status of Jerusalem will be banned. And therefore, PLO and Palestinian authority institutions in the city will be closed. It's crazy because I really don't have to paraphrase any of this if you give it a name. It's very clear to me at least what's going on here. Now I'm going to finish this off with what I feel is the most telling part of this because remember, Israel believes that the whole land including the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is all Israel, okay? And this explains the illegal settlements. But the government will set forth the goal of having seven million Jews within the next decade. They feel like this will strengthen them both economically and culturally. Number 11, the most telling part of this all, settlements in all parts of the land of Israel is of national importance and part of Israel's defense strategy. The government will allocate special resources for settlements and sparsely populated areas. So even though the UN and everybody says that those settlements are illegal according to the coup party, which is the current ruling party, they feel they don't recognize that those settlements are in illegal areas because according to them, it's all Israel. And those settlements are permitted to be there according to their government. So my resource is the James Madison University website.

Because Argentina had a history of turning down extradition requests for Nazi war criminals, Israeli President David Ben-Gurian granted Mossad a free hand in the matter. Mossad agents were quickly dispatched to the South American city, arriving on different days using different airlines and carrying forged passports from different countries with one objective, confirm Eichmann's identity and bring him back to Israel alive for trial. First, one of the members posing as a prospective land buyer used a concealed camera to get some close-up photos of the man who was suspected to be Eichmann so the photos could be compared. The photos were compared to known photos of Adolf Eichmann as well as contemporary photos of his brother who was said to bear a strong resemblance to Adolf. The photos confirmed the war criminal's identity and the kidnap job was given a green light. After observing Eichmann's routine for several days, the team devised a kidnap strategy and waited for his bus after work one day. As Eichmann approached the house, one of the team members called out pretending to ask for directions, and as he approached, Eichmann began to reach for his jacket so the Mossad agent grabbed his arm and his throat. Eichmann started yelling so one of the other agents began revving the car engine in an attempt to drown out his screams. Eichmann was successfully overpowered and was forced to the floor of the rear seat of the car. The agents drove some distance, changed their license plates, and then drove to a rented safe house. A questioned Eichmann for some time and he denied his identity. First he provided the name that he was living under in Argentina, then he provided the name that he'd been living under while hiding in Europe. But finally they just check under his arm for his SS tattoo. When they check under his arm, all they find is a burn scar so they ask him what his SS ID number was and the number that he gives matches Adolf Eichmann's exactly. So now they need to get Eichmann out of the country. The Israeli government has arranged for a special diplomatic aircraft flown by Israel's national airline to depart from Buenos Aires two days after the abduction, but the flight ends up being held for eight days for unrelated reason. During this time and while dodging a missing person's hunt, the agents force Eichmann to sign a letter, claiming that he's traveling to Israel of his own free will and then they disguise him as a flight attendant and inject him with sodium pentathol in order to make him cooperative and to make him appear to be drunk. Argentine authorities do stop the men and check all of their papers, including the papers they had forged for Eichmann, but other than that the return trip is mostly uneventful.

Palestinian Prime Minister is resigning over pressure about the postwar on Gaza. I'm going to give you an overview of a few bullet points to think about, but do not consider the western point of view first. This is something for the Palestinian people to think about and decide what their future should hold. An important part of decolonizing the world is decolonizing our own mindsets. So if you're American, if you're not from the least, take opinions with a grain of salt and there should be a lot of them coming your way. I have brushed over the Palestinian Authority throughout some of my videos. Only if you really watched everything you've ever posted in my have seen mentioned them. What I think is important to know is that they were supposed to be the interim government after the Oslo Accords. I made that video about Yasser Adafa when he accepted, considering some land to Israel as long as Palestinians would have their full independence. But Israel just broke that agreement completely. And that's why I get so annoyed when Americans still try to push the two-state solution. That has expired. If one party involved in a contract didn't deliver, their part of the contract is nullified. And any interim measure, including the Palestinian Authority, unfortunately, seems to have only empowered Israel whether they want that or not. Some people accuse them of corruption and some people just think that they are powerless because Israel just does what Israel wants. And the West does not let any accountability happen to Israelis. So what's important to know is Palestinians deserve to choose their leadership. They deserve self-determination and that leadership must be respected. This Palestinian Authority, their offices, is in occupied land, outside of Palestine. They can't even be present around their community. Violence settler in the West Bank has gotten out of control. In the past 10 years, in the past month alone, with the rulings of the ICJ, Israel has only emboldened themselves and they said, you know what we need to act? Past, erased Palestine. If there's no leadership there, that the world has been able to empower, to respect, regardless of the reason why they're resigning right now. The lesson is Palestinians need to be represented properly, choose their leadership and decide what they want politically. I'll keep my eye on the developments and anything worth sharing I will. But again, it's not up to the U.S. or any other country to decide what should happen politically to Palestinians. We shouldn't even get our noses and what the post-war plans are for Gaza. We just need to fund their rebuilding and their return home. Because if we have been able to fund their destruction, they deserve reparations. And that does not mean funding Israel and let Israel rebuild Gaza because we know what that means. That means they're going to take over and send more Americans and Europeans to live there. They're not going to allow anybody to return. So that's what I wanted to share.",subjective

On Sunday, Israel said its fighter jets struck in alleged munitions production site in southern Lebanon belonging to the Iran-backed Hezbollah.

For two days, this past weekend, hundreds of settlers rampaged through the West Bank, burning anything they could get their hands on, shooting live fire, resulting in the death of at least one Palestinian and injuring tens. These attacks were organized on WhatsApp and telegram groups and began hours before the murdered body of a 14-year-old boy was found. A 70-year-old news photographer said that some were wearing IDF uniforms and yielding guns and that 20 to 30 people beat him. A 70-year-old man. These are essentially programs and there's some video footage of it as well that you guys can take a look at on Breaking the Silence Israel. This is not the first time that this has happened. Last February, IDF forces were on the scene when settlers sat ablaze homes with families inside and no one was arrested or stopped. This is terrorism.

Tonight, air raid sirens blared in Jerusalem and other cities after Iran sent over 200 drones and missiles toward Israel. The aerial attack follows a deadly airstrike on April 1st on the Iranian Embassy complex in Damascus, Syria. The United States has been helping Israel tonight shooting down some drones. The Israeli military spokesperson called Iran's actions a severe and dangerous escalation. At least one casualty is reported. Earlier, President Biden rushed back to the White House from Delaware meeting with national security advisers. There is significant concern that this could widen the ongoing Israel-Gaza war to more of the Middle East. CBS' Debra Pata is in Tel Aviv with the latest. Debra, good evening. Good evening. Iran has launched its retaliatory attack, sending a swarm of drones towards Israel. Israel has deployed all of its air defense systems closed its airspace. And the war cabinet has convened to monitor the situation. The attack could take several hours to unfold. The past two days have seen heightened tensions in the region in the run-up to the attack, and it fears that this could spiral into a regional conflict. Iran seized a Portuguese container ship linked to an Israeli billionaire today. Iranian Revolutionary Guards boarded the vessel from a helicopter in the strait of Hormuz. Previously, Iran has threatened to shut down this crucial shipping route. And this morning, the Israeli defense force struck a Hezbollah military post in southern Lebanon. After the Iranian back fired a barrage of missiles over northern Israel last night, most of the missiles were intercepted. They were no injuries. We've been preparing for an attack from Iran for years, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier. We are ready for any scenario. The big fear now is that this could significantly escalate the conflict former Mossad official SEMA Shine told us. Is this the most worried you've been? Yeah. I think this is the most worried. I think it's on both sides in Israel and Iran. And at the end of the day, no one wants a full-scale regional war. Not even the threat of an attack by Iran could keep Israelis off the streets of Tel Aviv earlier tonight. Tens of thousands turned out to protest against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Israeli demonstrators believe he will do anything to stay in power, including prolonging the war in Gaza and escalating a confrontation with Iran. I think he failed. He should go home. Sunday is the start of the work week in Israel. All schools have been closed for the next two days. Gatherings in the North have been prohibited. And we, Jaree, people have been advised to stay near shelters. Debra Patta, thanks. CBS News, Chief Foreign Affairs correspondent and moderator of Face the Nation. Margaret Brennan joins me now. Margaret, how significant is this Iranian reprisal? Well, we just – it is significant because we now have multiple fronts in mid-east conflicts. This is no longer just Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza. This is now a state-on-state conflict with Iran itself. The launch tonight was from Iranian territory. And in Tehran, their leaders believe Israel started it by striking that Iranian diplomatic facility in Syria considered sovereign territory back on April 1st when they killed senior Iranian military leaders. So, the U.S. says it was not given a heads-up by Israel in regard to that Israeli strike on April 1st, but now the U.S. is involved as an Israeli ally. And we know President Biden is closely tracking all of this with his national security team. Can you talk about how much the U.S. is involved moving forward? Well, President Biden monitoring this moment by moment and the White House expects this attack to stretch out over a number of hours. The drones won't be the extent of it. And the impact is going to be judged based on how strong Israel's air defenses prove to be. And if there are any casualties, the U.S. has the capability to intercept some. As they cross Iraqi and Syrian air space, they put fighter jets, other assets on standby. The U.K. and Jordan are also helping to participate in some regional defense. So there is, in addition to the military efforts, a diplomatic effort underway to contain this tit for tit. So that it does not escalate into a regional war that could draw in other countries, including the United States, Rijah. And we know Israel has already vowed it will respond. And so much is that Stake Margaret. Thank you so much.",subjective

Israelis, you have been disenfranchising our people with the world's longest military occupation, illegally grabbing land and subjugating our people to squall at conditions as you cut us off of resources and basic rights and privileges. We have offered to share two state solution peace treaties five times in the past with you. The Peel Commission, the 1947 UN resolution, the Arab League Summit rejection of land offerings in the late 60s, the Camp David Yasser Arafat rejections of the 90s and the 2008 Mahmoud Abbas offer rejections and you still keep saying no. We are trying to work with you. We keep saying no because ultimately this is the land of our ancestors and we won't accept a Jewish authority, especially one that was forced upon the region by colonial powers of Europe and further assisted by United States imperialism. While this was the land of our ancestors too and far before the rise of any industrialist European power let alone a caliphate or Islamic authority. Our prophets even before Muhammad, a Muslim at this point would probably say peace be upon him, lived in the area as well and the Arabs, not all Muslims but specifically Arabs, are the descendants of Ishmael, son of Abraham as well as the true Muslim generations that lived and populated this area. That's a theological claim that we believe you believe. However, non-Muslims have a hard time believing it considering that there are no full Quranic texts before the time of Muhammad to affirm his statements. Sure, maybe you are descendants of Ishmael, just like we claim to be descendants of Isaac, but they took over most of Arabia, not the Levant. And to us, it seems like the Quran was just inspired awful stories from the Torah, Tannak, and New Testament in the Bible. Uh, okay, that is incredibly offensive and wrong. Your scriptures were corrupted and re-revealed to our prophet by Allah. You're the ones that came in and pushed out hundreds of thousands of Palestinians during the 1948 and 1967 Six Day Wars, and now you refuse refugees to write a return to their own homes prior to war times. Okay, yeah, we did displace them just as your Arab neighbors evacuated Jews from their lands that flocked to us. Why do you think there's hardly any Jews left in former countries that used to have hundreds of thousands like Morocco and Algeria? Arabs just started attacking us from all sides. We defended ourselves and won, and in post-war situations, it's not uncommon for the victor to repartition and consolidate land. After the Six Day War, we weren't even obligated to offer a two-state solution but gave Egypt the entire Sinai Peninsula back and offered you sovereignty, which you denied. Well, funny, because the way how you handle your sovereignty, which shouldn't exist, is a system that systematically oppresses us and blocked off neighborhood islands that you've created illegally and aren't even recognized by the UN. Well, what do you expect? We keep getting hostile threats and actions from literally every single person around us, and especially you. Gaza keeps shooting rockets to the point where we had to build that iron dome defense system. You've launched two antifotas against us with suicide bombers. Palestinians can enter our land through checkpoints, but Israelis are almost dead meat if they even try to enter your neighborhoods. Yeah, except your military, which by the way, your military has killed thousands of our people in the process, including children. Your people have killed our people in the process, including children. Yeah, well, you've killed way more. You keep responding with a lack of cooperation and aggression. What do you want us to do? Just put down all our weapons and say, okay, we trust you? What would happen to us Jews if you took over? Do you really think we would be treated with equal rights and dignity in a Palestinian run state? In a perfect world, we would ideally like you to just peacefully leave and return everything back to us the way it was prior to the British Mandate Times. Maybe some of you can stay, but the whole nation would have to be run by Palestinians. No, we have historical rights to live here too. The UN at least acknowledges that. We've built up so much, and even though it's kind of messy, we're still doing a good job considering our quality of life. Ha! Yeah, your quality of life. Once again, treaties denied. We don't settle for your propositions. Guys, guys, let's just chill out a little bit, okay? Here, I brought some bacon. Everybody loves bacon. You want some bacon? That's not kosher.

It is led by Mahmoud Abbas, and it is often cited by Zionists as this organization that radicalises Palestinians that is a massive obstacle to peace. However, this is a completely wrong understanding of the Palestinian Authority, and in reality, it's a horrendous entity that actually works with the state of Israel. The Palestinian Authority was created by the Oslo Accords of 1993 to 1995. And this organization is benevolent to the state of Israel because of the fact that although it receives money from international donors and such, this goes through Israel, and Israel can withhold funding from the Palestinian Authority if it doesn't behave in a way that helps to continue the occupation of the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority will regularly arrest Palestinians for political reasons, and it is also an entity that has only had two elections in its history, once in 1996 when Yasser Adafat became the first president of the Palestinian Authority, and then again in 2005 when Adafat was dead and the current leader Mahmoud Abbas took power, he has refused to have elections since, and they just never seem to happen. He's an unelected dictator effectively who has also brought his cronies into power, who do nothing good for the Palestinian people. Yet in spite of all of this and the fact that Zionists will tell you that the Palestinian Authority and Mahmoud Abbas are one of the biggest obstacles to peace, why on earth is the Israeli government saying that it will ensure that the Palestinian Authority will not collapse earlier this year? The reason that Israel is keeping the Palestinian Authority alive is actually a classic tactic from colonialism. Now when a population was restive after it had been colonized and it resisted the colonization, it fought back against the Europeans who'd come there. What it was better to do was to find a local leader who had some vague form of legitimacy and empower them because this would mean that there was a largest wave of the population who were accepting of said leader. The Palestinian Authority obviously has this kind of legitimacy because it's connected to Yasser Adafat, one of the most recognizable people in the Palestinian peace process.

The agency runs shelters for over 1 million people and provides food and primary health care. They have been the main supplier of food, water, and shelter in Gaza since October. So why is it that the United States, along with Canada, Australia, Britain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Finland, and Japan, have all holds with their funding, which together accounts for over 60% of the agency's total funds. A move that a UN-appointed expert on the right to food, Warns will mean famine is now inevitable in Gaza. This funding has been halted in response to the accusations against 12 UNRWA staff members in Gaza, and as Commissioner General Lazareini shared, it is shocking to see a suspension of funds to the agency and reaction to the allegation against a small group of staff, especially given the immediate action that the UNRWA took by terminating their contracts and asking for a transparent, independent investigation. Lazareini has urged countries that have suspended funding to the UNRWA to reconsider before the agency is forced to suspend its humanitarian response in Gaza. UN Secretary General Antonio Gutarae says 2 million Palestinians in Gaza, which is 87% of the population, rely on the UNRWA services, that would be scaled back as soon as February, if the money is not restored. Although aid can reach Gaza through other agencies, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, the key infrastructures for delivering aid in Gaza is through the UNRWA. The near collapse in the UNRWA's funding comes after the ICJ on Friday issued its order requiring Israel to take immediate and effective measures immediately to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance. The effect of the allegations in the US media was to shift the spotlight, rapidly away from the ICJ ruling on Israel's control of aid flows, and on to the credibility of the main organization delivering aid. If you live in one of the countries who have cut their funding, contact your representative and demand that they reinstate it. Make as much noise as we can, I cannot stress how dire an immediate this situation is. If you're able, you can donate directly to the UNRWA through the link where links go, or directly on their website.",subjective

While the Israeli army protects the settlers. What's the problem? It's a problem. Our field and you are watching him? Yes. That's your job? Our job is to secure him. You're him, my dear, stealing my field? That day, June 22nd, settlers from the nearby settlements and outpost came to this water in order to steal our water. Because water is very important, their government doesn't allow us to connect to water vibes. And for them, in order to drink it or to throw it out of the water, they know that we will be thirsty. While Israeli settlers steal their water and crops, Israeli government wants to steal their land. Palestinian communities, including Meslefriyata, are an imminent threat of forced expulsion from their own homes by the Israeli government. Israel has declared huge chunks of the occupied West Bank as firing zones, which are areas that Israel's army says it needs for military training, but are used as an excuse to force Palestinians out of their homes. Israel has declared at least 18% of the occupied West Bank as firing zones, including Meslefriyata, where Ali and his family live. That means more than 5,000 Palestinians across the West Bank could be forced out of their homes at any moment. The last May 2022, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled in favor of the military after they declared all the area, including Tuba as a firing zone in order to spill the Palestinians from their own villages. It is enabled by the state because the state gives them the legal protection and the soldiers in the field supports them in order to harass the Palestinians, the properties and villages. But calling this land a firing zone is just another way Israel steals Palestinian land and encourages Israelis to build more illegal settlements. Ali says that even though his family's home is still standing for now, Israeli settlers are doing the work of trying to force them out and all under the watchful eye of the Israeli military. So, if the demolition, if the declaration of the firing zone, if putting Palestinians in military tracks, will not happen, they will let the settlers continue the job by terrorizing the Palestinians and making their lives unbelievable here. While settlers damage their property, Israeli soldiers blindfolded in handcuffs Ali and his uncle. The settlers entered inside our houses and destroyed the windows and the furniture. Right now, it's a point of ultra-national settler, Buzalos-Motrich. To control the occupied West Bank, Ali says the settler violence is not something new. The government is in the hands of settlers. Like being a veer, he's just like living near Tinksten, Safriyatta. In Kriyat, he's a settler living in a stolen house and then a stolen land as well as Bitsile. But even like the judge who ruled our homes in Safriyatta in favor of the military, he's a settler also living in illegal settlements. The struggle against us is by the Israeli attempt of displacing us from Safriyatta is not just from this year. We have been living in our area, what like our home, where declared as a firing zone since the 80s. More than 40 years ago, and we are facing the home demolition and the settlers' expansion and the building of the settlements. While Palestinians are being systematically displaced from their homes, Israel's presence across the occupied West Bank has only deepened since Smotrich's appointment. The church made plans for an additional 500,000 Israeli settlers to move to the occupied West Bank. We are talking just in a few months. There are two Palestinian communities in the Jordan Valley that lift because of the settler violence in Samia and Lbaga. And there are other communities under threat people are hopeless having no safety. They don't think that they want to raise children in this community. Based on the amount of settler violence, all the pillars of the occupation is working on tandem in order to force the Palestinians of the lands. Working in tandem together, settlers and soldiers all enforced with the laws and rules. I'm sorry to call them laws, our rules. They are colonial laws that enforce by them and they protect them. And they have the power to enforce against us in order to let us obey to achieve their colonial benefits.",subjective

The question is should we also be boycotting Marvel comics? I mean like Marvel Entertainment doesn't make a lot of money from Marvel comics. They're barely worth the paper that they're printed on. But let's be real guys. Marvel comics are part of Disney. They're part of Marvel. They're still making some money. And the least we can do is nothing. I don't want to be supporting genocide. I don't want to be not supporting genocide simply on a technicality. I don't want to be the kind of person that is like, well I'm technically allowed to do this. And it's like, people are dying. Like there's more things that are important than like your comic collection. I and other Mutuals will be watching the website more closely to see if they say anything about comics. But until they say, hey you can buy comics old and new from Marvel, I'm not going to. Frankly I'm a broke college student. I shouldn't be buying from Marvel comics. I know that a lot of my Mutuals are pivoting to talking about DC or to Indie Comics. I'll try to get into Indie Comics. I'm not getting into DC. I won't do it. What I can do is not financially support Marvel Entertainment until they get this character gone from Marvel 4. I deal with taking care of in the comics in some way that like actually addresses this conflict. I think that like that is a potential story that could be told but I don't think they're going to do it. They could have done it when Lee and Kirby were around but they're not going to do it now because comics aren't political anymore. I'm sorry but I'm not going to support their movies or their comics or their merch or any of that. And I'm also not going to be talking about Marvel Comics or just Marvel movies in general but hey I didn't want to talk about the MCU in the first place. When it comes to entertainment as something that we buy and consume, it's more, it's about more than your dollar. It's also about sort of like the cultural capital it has. It's not the same as Starbucks where you can just go and replace it with a drink. You just like even talking about Marvel gives it some kind of power. It gives it some kind of free promotion. And I just I can't in good conscious do that because people are fucking dying. What I've thought about in terms of pivoting my content is kind of going back to fandom terminology. And I do want to make more of those videos and like hey you could boost this video by talking about that so more people know about this boycott. Tell me what kind of fandom trends you want to talk about in the comments so that this video doesn't get flagged please God. But also like the question is am I allowed to talk about Marvel fanfic? You know like that's a different video that I want to make. Actually the power that fandom has and its responsibility as a political tool and also as a tool of social capital. So yeah let's not buy Marvel let's not talk about Marvel. The question of Marvel fanfiction is something that needs its own video.",subjective

I think I saw a post that had 50 different companies and brands y'all are trying to boycott. I'm not saying this because it's inconvenient for me. I'm saying this because I feel that a lot of people are not paying attention to the actual boycott divestments and sanctions website, which is the organization that's been doing the hard work behind a boycott of Israeli goods for years. Their website only lists eight brands and companies to boycott. The reason I'm saying this is because telling people to boycott 50, 70, hell, even like 20 brands and companies is just too much. People are not going to remember it. When you go to the grocery store, most people aren't going to check every single item they put into their cart against a list of 50 brands to see if it's boycott or not. So what's going to end up happening is you're going to have like 50 different brands and companies on a list that you're boycotting and people are just going to be so overwhelmed they're not going to even try. Or you're going to have people picking and choosing a few that they kind of remember, but it's the boycott is so spread out between like so many different brands and companies and it doesn't have any impact. The point of a boycott is to like accumulate pressure on a few specific brands and companies so that they yield to public pressure. And the boycott divestments and sanctions movement, BDS, they've done the work of identifying the companies that do the most harm because of their activities and contribute the most to supporting Israel's apartheid system. According to the BDS website here are the brands and companies you should actually be boycotting and there's only eight HP which sells like computers, Simon's or Siemens, I don't know, a tech company, you know, that does security and electronic systems, AXA or AXA, I don't know, which is an insurance company, Puma with sells shoes, generally just all fruits and veggies that are grown in Israel's, Israel's steel's Palestinian land to grow that food, soda stream, which sells like carbonated water and carbonated products, stuff like that. I have a cosmetics and of course, Sabra or Sabra, I don't really know how you say it, it's the shitty hummus, but yeah that's it.

Nicket into the ocean, which his yacht was the lady Jislin, named for his daughter. Look, it's an Israeli spy operation and these guys are unwilling to say it. They're afraid of saying the words.

We're going to play today two of those interviews that I recorded probably ten years ago. And the first one that you're going to hear in this first hour was the book Israel's Super Spy. Robert Maxwell, Israel's Super Spy, who was Robert Maxwell, just land Maxwell's father, the handler of Jeffrey Epstein. Here's my interview with Gordon Thomas. In 1991, the world media industry was rocked by the sudden and unexplained, mysterious death of British media tycoon Robert Maxwell. Mr. Maxwell was one of the wealthiest men in the world. His media empire reached across Great Britain, Europe, and Israel and the United States of America. He rivaled the biggest names in media, including Rupert Murdoch. But in 1991, Mr. Maxwell came to a sudden demise. And immediately after his death, the 1991, there were a number of stories that began to surface that perhaps his death was not accidental or natural. I have an article in front of me. This is a dated 1991 to 14th 1991. It says British media tycoon Robert Maxwell died of natural causes and a plunge from his yacht during a cruise last month off the Canary Islands. A judge has ruled the autopsy report cast doubt on theories of foul play and suicide. But did not rule them out altogether. And it did not dispel the mystery that has grown up since Maxwell's death as his vast and financially overextended empire has crumbled amid suspicion of massive fraud. Well, Gordon Thomas, the award-winning internationally-claimed author of numerous books on intelligence agencies and espionage, along with his co-worker Martin Dillon, have just completed the publication of an absolutely incredible book on the life and death of Robert Maxwell. The book is entitled Robert Maxwell, Israel's Super Spy, The Life and Murder of a media mogul. This book is absolutely, it is riveting. You can't put this book down because Gordon Thomas and Martin Dillon bring to the pages of this book an intricate detail about the involvement of Robert Maxwell with the Israeli Mossad Spy Agency and they show how it was the Mossad who put an end to Robert Maxwell's career. All the telephone with me right now from his home in Ireland is the author, the co-author of this book Gordon Thomas Gordon. Welcome back to American Freedom Ice. I want to move back again. Oh Gordon, I'll tell you, I can't put this book down. This is a fascinating book. You've outdone yourself. What is this? Your 40th book? Yeah, it's a 40th book.

This is before we invaded Iraq and he said, quote, there is no question whatsoever that Sidhah Hussein is seeking and is working and is advancing towards the development of nuclear weapons. He then went on to say he was hiding nuclear facilities underground. We now know this was a lie. One that many U.S. service members in innocent Iraqis paid the price for. Netanyahu in that same congressional hearing goes on to say, obviously we'd like to see regime change at least I would in Iran. The question now is what is the best way to proceed? It's not a question of whether you'd like to see regime change in Iran, but how to achieve it. So my two questions for you are one, how can we trust somebody who go to our country into war in Iraq based on falsehoods and two, given this weekend's events, why are we confident he won't do the same thing with Iran, given he's been calling for us to enact regime change in that country for 20 years? I'm not sure I fully understand your question, but so let me just say a couple things. First, as it relates to Prime Minister Netanyahu, this is somebody who the president has a close working relationship with. It's something someone that the Secretary has a close working relationship with, but broadly beyond any immediate official or individual in the Israeli government, our partnership, our relationship with Israel are commitment to itself defense and our commitment to its security transcends any government in Israel. It transcends any government in the United States and it's a relationship that has pursued and persisted over the course of the various political parties and presidents. Number two, as it relates to the Iranian regime, let me just be clear and unequivocal about this. In the strongest terms, it's reckless and irresponsible attacks from over the course of this past weekend. Okay, but you won one individual, Netanyahu, is the head of the entire Israeli government and when you might condemn those, but there's a difference between condemning those actions and the U.S. getting roped into a war with Iran. The United States is not interested in entering an all-out conflict with Iran. And it's incredibly clear about that, even if they strike Israel. We have been very clear about our commitment to Israel's security and its self-defense. We've also been clear that we will not be participating in any offensive operation, but our commitment to its security and self-defense is ironclad.",subjective

Separate from that, the groups in modern-day Lebanon and Palestine did not speak Arabic. That creator is clumping all Arabs up together and that is so damaging to the Palestinian cause. Come to the genetic part. Palestinians arise from Canaanites. I explained that in my previous video. So I'm really interested in genetics because of my background in science. I never really considered the linguistic aspect of this area. It was not Arabized because Arabic originated from the Levant. Palestinians are Arabized, which is true. She's saying Palestinians are not Arabized because Arabic originated in the Levant. This is the Levant. It's a very large area and a lot of sometic languages arose in this area. So I also made me interested in looking into it and here's a tree of all the sometic languages. Arabic arose from the central sometic branch while the people that are native to the land of Palestine, Lebanon, open to the Islamic conquest of the 7th century. They were speaking a range of different languages under the northwest sometic branch. Arabic Hebrew, Ammonite, Phoenician, also Arabic. Wasn't until the 7th century Islamic conquest that Arabization unified the land. Zionists, say Palestinians, never existed and just came during this conquest, which is obviously not true. Being Arab is a cultural, linguistic, and ethnic identity. We're all very unified in one large community. However, I'm not going to force all Arabs to be clumped together and erase their individual identity.",subjective

At the time, the Canadian songwriter was living in Greece, and while most known as Rayleigh Jews watched the war unfold from afar, he immediately wanted to do what he could to help. So he went to Israel without a plan, hoping he could volunteer on a cabbages to help fill the labor shortage, as young men were called up to fight. Instead, he was spotted at a Tel Aviv cafe by Israeli singer Oshik Levy, who explained that he was going to sign eye to entertain the troops and suggested that Cohen join him. One of the biggest singers in the world suddenly found himself in the desert, putting his life in danger to play a small impromptu gig for soldiers, with an acoustic guitar and an ammo crate for a stage. Cohen spent weeks performing on the frontlines during one of the darkest moments in Israeli history. He asked those he met to call him by his Hebrew name, Ali Azer. The experience was a major source of inspiration for his next album, new skin for the Old Cemetery, released in 1974. My songs are always Jewish, they can't be anything else but Jewish. His extraordinary act of solidarity during the Yom Kapoor war remains profound in the hearts of Israelis. Follow for Jewish facts daily.",subjective

Oh, because Israel said that 12 out of its 13,000 employees were affiliated with the Moss. I've been waiting about a week to respond to this. There's a continuous pattern with this guy, where nearly every one of his arguments is just an appeal to a motion. Like here he's trying to say, well, only 12 members of the UNRWA were affiliated with Hamas and what they did on October 7th. It should be none. That is a United Nations agency, dude, and agencies belonging to or affiliated with the United Nations should not be involved in carrying out terrorist attacks. And the IDF just discovered a tunnel underneath the UNRWA building. Again, a terrorist tunnel network under a UNRWA headquarter's building. And now everyone is supposed to believe that the UNRWA had no clue that these people were underneath them. And you know how the IDF came to the conclusion that there was a tunnel network under this UN Headquarters building? They gathered this intelligence after they interrogated captured members of Hamas. And you see this information about there being a tunnel underneath this headquarters building? Yeah, that's not even why these 18 countries have cut the funding to the UNRWA. You see, there was a dossier report with classified intelligence and that intelligence was gathered and seen by the UNRWA. And that information, whatever that intelligence may be, has not yet been made publicly available. And that is not atypical. This is a time of war and conflict. And this is a dossier which contains highly classified material. So to just suggest that all these countries are going to stop funding the UNRWA because Israel made an allegation is just dumb. And the IDF had already been through this area. They had already covered all the places around this UN Headquarters building. And they had no idea that there was a tunnel network directly underneath them, which was housing the exact people they were trying to fight. And I guess we all wonder why? They would have a tunnel network under a UN Headquarters. Obviously that was sarcasm. We all know why. It's because Israel can't do anything there. The tunnels are protected because right above them is a UN Headquarters building. And obviously the IDF can't just bomb a UN Headquarters. This is what people mean when they say that this group shields themselves within infrastructure. And I'm not sure of the specifics, but I'm pretty sure that building and operating out of a tunnel network directly beneath a UN Headquarters building is a violation of international law. And for all the people who for some reason still might not be believing this, here's some drone footage. You can see here exit from a hole drilled in the tunnel shaft. The drone's going to come up. It's going to go around. And it's going to show a steel photo shot or video shot of the headquarters building. Wait for it. And here you can see wiring from the UN Headquarters building, which they say is connected to intelligence and communication assets in the tunnel. They say server room, which constitutes a Hamas intelligence asset located in the tunnel. And Commissioner General Felipe Lazareini said the UN RWA did not know what is under its headquarters in Gaza. Yet again we see here there's electrical wiring attached to the tunnel, which is coming from the UN Headquarters building. So I guess we're all going to have to wait for an explanation as to why they have electrical wiring coming from the Headquarters building going underground to where? Why exactly would they have electrical wiring going underneath the ground? Also, my dad, why was all the security footage as to the entrances and exits and the gated portions of this headquarters? Why was all that removed and cut off? So if you see all this and you still think that the UN RWA had no clue what was happening directly underneath them, then you can keep living in whatever fantasy road you wish to. And I'll say it again, this tunnel discovery is a side. This is a whole different thing than the accusations of the specific members who were involved with the attacks. This is not what UN agencies do. This is not what the United Nations stands for and the UN should not shield or protect them during this time. They deserve to be defunded.",subjective

But the Dome of the Rock is within the Meshital Upsa compound. This whole entire area is Meshital Upsa. Meshital Upsa is in the heart of outputs of Jerusalem, and yes, it's incredible recitation rings throughout the city. Take it to Meshital Upsa, you walk through the old city. It is filled with so much joy and festivity, markets and people. And then you get to one of the many green doors, which surround Meshital Upsa, when they open, you enter the Meshital Upsa compound. All of this is Meshital Upsa. There are five Moshallas in it, Al-Burak, Al-Kibli, Al-Marwani, Al-Rwa'hma, and the Dome of the Rock, Kubat-A-Suchra. Every stone, every tree in this massive compound is all part of Meshital Upsa. The blessed Meshid, in which not a single spot hasn't been walked on by a prophet or an angel. This is that same area that you just saw, except with the Dome of the Rock behind us and filled with believers. And this, if you look all the way ahead and see those trees, beyond it is a wall with the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, tied Al-Burak, during Isra-Wa-Marwaj. This is the front of one of the five Moshallas in Meshital Upsa called Al-Burak. This is an inside look. And when you step outside, you see Al-Kibli, which is also sometimes called Al-Aqsa. This is if you between the Dome of the Rock and Al-Kibli, which again is sometimes called Al-Aqsa. But this entire area is Al-Aqsa. Here is a front view of Al-Kibli, and let's go inside. Coming out of Al-Kibli, let's head to Al-Marwani. Again, this entire area is Meshital Upsa. That Dome is from Kibli, which we just exited. Those tents are because of the Ikti-Kaf and Ramadan. And this is the outside of Al-Marwani. The Crusaders used Al-Marwani as stables for horses. And in fact, they had desecrated the entirety of Meshital Upsa. In the 1920s, the British forcibly closed this area. And because it's a subterranean messaged, dirt and trees grew over it. In the 90s, Palestinians beautifully excavated and renovated it. This is the inside of Al-Marwani. You can still see a ring which the horses were kept on during the 10th Crusaders. You can just imagine Angel Gabriel, Virgin Mary, Prophet Zechariah, Prophet Jesus, peace be upon all of them. Being present here and in all of the areas of Meshital Upsa. Leaving Al-Marwani, we are going to Arwahma. It is said that within this Mishallah, Imam Al-Kazali secluded himself and wrote Ehya Rulumuddin. On the other side of that far back wall, outside of Meshital Upsa is a cemetery. And it are buried two companions of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, who helped open Meshital Upsa. Orbed Ibn Shwamit, Ruliyallahu Anhu, whose wife was Umhram bin Sumin'han, Ruliyallahu Anhu, the martyr of the sea. And Shadad Ibn Os, Ruliyallahu Anhu. From this view, the cemetery is to the back right. The old Syrian Upsa are behind us. This is called the Street of Mardir's Toriyak Ash-Shuhada. That hill is where the companions encamped waiting for Umar Ruliyallahu Anhu to come at the behest of the head of the Christian community. Who said that Umar was the person described in their books as the one to receive the keys to the holy city. Umar accepted the keys with immense humility and he established a policy of safety, justice, and peace for the Jews and Christians of the city as well. He asked Bilal to make the Yavan, and with a deep emotion for the first time Bilal Ruliyallahu Anhu made the Yavan in Meshital Upsa. Unfortunately, I don't have footage of an entire section of Upsa. However, let's go ahead into the Dhamma of the rock. The Dhamma of the rock is where Umar Darda Issukhura, the scholar, would teach. She would teach within it and outside of it. The Imam of Meshital Upsa, Sheikh Yusuf Abu Sinan Atatas, there were 20,000 women, scholars who graduated nearby to Upsa and would teach here and travel to Syria to teach there. That tradition continues as women scholars continue to learn and teach in Upsa today. Meshital Upsa is the third holiest Meshital in Islam and the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, taught. There is not a single inch of Elkwoods where a prophet has not prayed and an angel has not stood. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, taught.",subjective

Why is that? Because what you're doing is you're punishing everyone in relation to BDS, whether it's boycotts, whether it's divestment, whether it's sanctions. It's not micro-targeted about what you want to achieve. But also the downside far away is the upside. So I understand why people feel passionate about this. Israel is the only nation in the world that's Jewish, the majority. So people are nervous about the impact of how's on Jewish people, as well as those Palestinians, many of them Muslims, who are working occupied territories. So people understandably are trying to think about the levers they can pull in relation to putting pressure on Netanyahu. I think there are much more effective levers than British government has. Well, you mentioned South Africa. In apartheid, South Africa, in particular, and boycotts and sanctions were key tools that were used to rally support for the ANC for support against apartheid, which inevitably was successful in bringing down the apartheid.

And in 2022, she modeled for four-year viewing pleasure, a fashion brand founded by a Palestinian and indigenous American designer. Throughout the years, speaking out has cost Alana friendships, and she's endured regular death threats, threats of violence, and slurs.

They've put no pressure on them for this to happen.

This is Benjamin Netanyahu's son, Yeh Netanyahu, who publicly courtesize the IDF and the high court of Israel for what they're doing to Palestine. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's son, Sparks controversy, with Telegram channel post-attacking the IDF court and media. That's right, Benjamin Netanyahu's son himself said it. He's sides with Palestine. Now, he may not have come right out and said the big P word, but he most definitely criticized the IDF and the high court on for the way that they are handling things as of right now. Now, if you ask me, it's some trouble going on on the home front and the son is like, he's just as, you know, he's just as a little chemically unbalanced as his father is. So he's more than likely making sure he's standing on business by selling his daddy out to the highest better. I'm not saying that's true, but I'm saying that he picked the fine time to decide he wanted to speak up about what's going on. And while the son you want to speak up now, and why not any kind of clarity or transparency on what exactly your thoughts and your feelings are, you're simply just criticizing the IDF. These are the things that you have to pay attention to because if he's not openly screening that he's pro, Palestinian, then this isn't something that we should be celebrating to the extremity. However, we can't keep key and laugh a little bit at the fact that he can't even keep his own kids under control. Let alone try to keep guys under control. You are even the time you are killing all these kids and you can't even, you can't even tell you all. You can't even throw your own kids. Never mind the fact that your own military is so bad. So bad at their job, they had to stage a headquarters or I'm sorry, a meeting spot. And then on top of that, they missed so many marks in it, especially in living in a digital age. You would think with all the boasting and tick-tocking that the IDF and IAF have been doing that, maybe they would be a little bit better at being able to scrub and beat these things to the internet. But honey, it's going down, okay? On the other side of town and Streets is talking and with the Streets is saying that your own son don't even like you. Your folks, they don't know what to do. They don't all this crazy stuff. Nicky getting caught up in lies. Baby, it's falling apart right before our eyes. Like I said, I'm not going to get too, too, too excited. But it's like as each day passes by more and more credibility, it's lost on their end. So it's at the point where it's only a matter of time before it completely unravels because you've lost practically all of your supporters. Not practically, you have. You've lost all of your supporters except America, England is still on the fence, but everybody else, they have jumped ship. You're losing our celebrity and you went through the majority of your, you know, the stuff that you already got over there. I honestly don't think that the five day pause had anything to do with the hostages, it's giving them some time to regroup and think about things. And then also get more military support over there. Come up with another plan, find a way to spread more misinformation. IE fabricated truths. Thank you, Donald Trump for that. But I just thought that this was hilarious because ain't this your sign? You all hear quote in the Bible, but you didn't even get this one right. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying. If God don't do nothing else, he's going to do whatever he can to use the people around you to get to you. So I'm saying, it's all I'm saying, baby, that foundation is crumbling like a house of cards. And then sooner or later, it's going to have to come crumbling down. And then what is the American army in Israel going to have to say in order to defend themselves in this situation because baby, we not stop and even win your stop. We want all this stuff changed.

I'm about to tell you three facts that you may have never heard before, so watch until the end, and this third one may shock you. Fact number one, the Bible prophesied that Israel would become a nation again. This happened in 1948, fulfilling prophecies from hundreds of years ago. Fact number two, the Bible said that after Israel became a nation again, they would regain control of Jerusalem. This happened in the Six Day War of 1967. Again, fulfilling prophecy. Fact number three, the Bible says that surrounding Arab nations will attack Israel in the end times. We are seeing increased tensions between Israel and neighboring countries like Iran, fulfilling more end times prophecy right before our eyes. So in summary, Israel becoming a nation, regaining Jerusalem, and increased hostility from surrounding nations, were all prophesied in the Bible thousands of years ago.

Named after the Arabic term for Jerusalem, the Kudz Force symbolizes Iran's broader ambition to play a dominant role in the Middle East and beyond. Established during the Iran-Araq War in the 1980s, the Kudz Force's primary mission was to expand the Islamic Revolution's ideals. Over time, its role evolved from merely ideological to strategic, seeking to project Iranian influence across the region and counter-possive threats. The Kudz Force operates differently from traditional military units. Rather than direct military interventions, they specialize in asymmetric warfare, leveraging proxy militias, conducting intelligence operations, and engaging in economic and diplomatic activities that further Iranian interests abroad. One of the most significant and known involvements of the Kudz Force has been in Lebanon, through its support for Hezbollah. Founded with Iranian guidance in the early 1980s, Hezbollah has become a major political and military force in Lebanon. The group's success in challenging Israel and its dominant role in Lebanese politics is often attributed to the support and training provided by the Kudz Force. In Iraq, following the US-led invasion in 2003, the Kudz Force capitalized on the power vacuum and sectarian strife. They established ties with Shia militias and political parties. The popular mobilization forces, PMF, a coalition of various militias, received significant support from the Kudz Force, further embedding Iranian influence in Iraq's political and security landscape. Syria offers another testament to the Kudz Force's regional prowess. As the Syrian civil war erupted, the Kudz Force was instrumental in supporting President Bashar al-Assad's regime. By mobilizing and coordinating various Shia militias, they helped turn the tide in favor of Assad, ensuring the survival of a key Iranian ally. Yemen is yet another battleground for the Kudz Force, albeit indirectly. The Hothi rebels, who have been fighting the Yemeni government since 2004, reportedly received support from the Kudz Force. This conflict is often seen as a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia, with the Kudz Force playing a significant role in supporting Iran's interests. The modus operandi of the Kudz Force often involves establishing local militias or groups, providing them with training, funding, and weapons. This not only allows Iran to have a footprint in these countries but also ensures that the host nation's politics align with Iranian interests. It's not just military and strategic support, the Kudz Force also delves into economic projects. In Iraq, for instance, they've been involved in reconstruction projects, further embedding Iranian influence in the country's fabric. The Kudz Force's activities aren't limited to the Middle East. They have been linked to operations in Latin America, Africa, and even Europe. These operations range from building relations with like-minded groups to allegedly planning attacks on adversaries. The assassination of the Kudz Force's commander, Kasim Salamani, in January 2020 by a US drone strike, brought the organization to global limelight. Salamani's role was pivotal in shaping the Kudz Force's strategy in expanding Iran's regional footprint. His death was a significant blow, but the force remains operational, adapting to new challenges. One of the criticisms of the Kudz Force is its alleged involvement in extremist activities. numerous governments and international entities have designated the Kudz Force as an extremist organization due to its support for groups like Hezbollah and its alleged plotting of attacks on foreign soil. However, from Iran's perspective, the Kudz Force is a strategic asset, furthering its regional ambitions and countering threats, especially from the US, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. The force's activities are seen as a defensive mechanism, given the host of challenges and adversaries Iran faces. In conclusion, the Kudz Force represents Iran's ambition and capability to project power beyond its borders. Through a mix of military, intelligence, economic, and diplomatic activities, they've ensured that Iran remains a key player in regional geopolitics. While controversial, their influence is undeniable, shaping the Middle East's political and security dynamics. The force's future actions and the reactions they elicit will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in the region's unfolding story.",subjective

So essentially this morning a full blown civil war erupted between Israel and Palestine, Israel is in blue and Palestine currently is in yellow and green. With the Palestinian group Hamas launching a surprise attack on Israel out of the Gaza Strip here as you can see in green. Hamas is generally described as a Palestinian Islamic fundamentalist group and also designated as a terrorist group by these countries and organizations you can see next to me. Is worth noting that not all nations or organizations believe Hamas is classified as a terrorist group such as in the Arabian Peninsula for example? With certain countries and organizations level in similar accusations against sects of the Israeli forces. It's a little complicated but I think the main reason for these accusations of terrorism being leveled against both Israel and Palestine historically has been due to the death of innocent civilians on both sides. This is usually come in the form of let's say a member of Hamas launching a terrorist attack against Israeli civilians and then Israeli civilians' diners result. And on the flip side to that you've got Israeli forces such as in the Israeli Defense Forces who are supposed to go after the terrorists, but there's no doubt that innocent Palestinians' civilians get caught in the midst of that. Have there also been arguments and disagreement in relation to the number of civilian deaths on both sides and the type of force that you used?

In Samas launch these attacks on Israeli settlements this morning the Israeli Prime Minister declared a state of war with about 40 people being killed in total so far. Ram 5000 rockets already haven't been fired at Israel with also a group of Israeli civilians being taken hostage by Hamas. As a result you probably expect the Israeli government to send more ground troops down to the Gaza Strip and also to fire their own rockets into the strip. Having said all this this is probably the biggest development in the Israeli Palestinian conflict we've had in quite a while. I'll also make sure to keep you guys updated on a daily basis to the events that have transpired in this current conflict.",subjective

You can't talk about the Kennedy assassination without talking about Israel without talking about the Messiah. They're the main people of the assault that's the main person fault. The Prime Minister of Israel at the time said that without nuclear weapons Israel would not survive. Kennedy was asking and asking for neutral scientists to observe the reactor. He continued to push for this with CIA director McCone and finally was granted access. Israel prior to the visit set up a fake control room with fake control panels in part of the agreement was that the inspectors were never going to be able to inspect the actual reactor. After that visit, Kennedy was quoted in saying, those sons of bitches lied to me constantly about their nuclear capability. The Jewish community invites J. of K to come to Dallas which was sponsored by the Dallas Citizens Council which was directed by Julius Shepz who was a member of the local benign we're in organization the ADL benign Brit once again a confirmed member of the local benign Brit as well Abraham Zapruder was also just so happened to be the guy that caught the assassination on film. Zapruder was also a manufacturer headquartered in the Dallas textile building. According to ballistic studies it was from that building the first two shots were fired and missed. Looms who pushed the hardest for the police to transfer Lee Harvey Oswald from the Dallas police station to the Dallas County jail. Now it was during that transfer that Jack Ruby shot Oswald what was Jack Ruby's real last name? Yuck up Rubenstein.

Yeah, there's a demeaning aspect to that whole thing. Very even in subtle ways. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I have so many Palestinian friends within American passport, US passport, living here. They're born here. And they talk about their humiliation and their intimidation and the harassment that they go in. It's like, ah, I don't want me to try. Yeah, that little bit of a humiliation. A little bit. Sometimes it's major, but... I know. I noticed that even the little bit has... After a lifetime of that, it can turn to hate towards the other. Yeah, resentment. Resemmond. And then how do you do anything with that resentment? I have a friend of mine. He is from Palestine, from the West Bank. He's American here, he's born here. And we talk about... You know, we have, of course, all of this discussion of what would happen. And he told me, you know, in October 11th, in the West Bank, in those village called Kostra. And on that village, like the settlers went in, around the region, they sent a message on Facebook, because like you rats going, they get out of their sewers, and we're gonna be waiting for you, intimidation through technology. And then they went... It is... Kostra has like another settlement next to it, called the Eshkodesh. Eshkodesh. They have people there who were training something called Mishmerati Isha, which is basically the guardians of Isha. And it's like a paramilitary group that trains other settlers on melancholy combat, give them weapons and do like military drills. And they went there like militarized and went there. And it was actually co-founded by Adju from Brooklyn, not even in Israel. And he's like one of the disciples of Mayor Kahana, I'm sure that you know what Mayor Kahna is, who was... Adju's defancy, the people who assassinated Alex Auda here in the United States. And they were there with their weapons outside, intimidating people. Now this story carries everything that is wrong with the situation. You have people from Brooklyn from outside, just because they're Jewish, they can't come and they can't blame the land from the people there. Anybody from Poland, just because they're Jewish, you can come and take the land from other people. They're using technology to intimidate Palestinians. They have unchecked military power. These are not IDF soldiers. These are settlers and they have free reign in order to intimidate and to kill the people. And you understand, this is the daily life of Palestinians. Not in Gaza, in the West Bank. What do you do from your... What do we do? What do people do to nudge this towards peace, towards flourishing? Here's the thing, I want to talk to the people of Israel. What is Israel doing right now is not just unfair to the Palestinians, it's unfair to the Jewish people in Israel. No, it is unfair to the Jewish people around the world. Because the way that Israel links itself to the Jewishism, at a certain point, remember like ISIS and Qaeda and everybody hid at Muslims? Sometimes, humans are simply, they cannot have the nuances to separate. So anybody who, with a Muslim name, with a Muslim face, with a beard, who looks Muslim, he would do it because of that actions of those atrocities. You have the power as a person to separate yourself from an abusive power, a horrible power and be yourself. I am really worried because the rise of anti-Semitism and the rise of hate against Jews is not because of the Jews, it's because of the actions of a government. Jews do not have to be on the side of apartheid, Rony Kestriels. He is a Jewish South African and he showed it to Shor the next two, Nelson Badella. He was part of the African National Conference A&C. And he had an article said like, I know what apartheid is and I saw Israel and this is what they have. And the thing is Israel, that Israeli government should listen to other people. You cannot call anybody who criticized you either an anti-Semite or if they're already Jewish, you call them like self-fating Jews. You cannot do that, you cannot continue doing that because we did that when I would go in and criticize the Islamist, it's like all your self-fating Muslim. You're not really Muslim, you're an infidel, you're a secret, you're a secular, whatever. We have the power in order to reform the course by holding people in power accountable. And I think it is very stupid to actually call this anti-Semitism. I like my idol is John Stuart. I voted for Bernie Sanders. Sarah Taksler, the one who did this amazing documentary about me, Tickling Giants, she's a Jew, she is married to an Israeli Jew. We have a good ratio because we know what the right is.

The roots of this conflict can be traced back to the early 20th century, when Jewish immigrants began pushing for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. As these Jewish people moved into the area, Palestinian Arabs resisted their presence. After the establishment of Israel as an independent country in 1948, they went to war with the coalition of their Arab neighbors. Even though this war ended in a ceasefire, tensions continued to evolve. In 1967, Israel lost another war, and as a result, began to occupy the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Golan Heights. Since then, Israel has continued to maintain a military presence in these territories. These circumstances have resulted in many Palestinian people being displaced from their homes. Although many attempts have been made to end the conflict, a permanent agreement has yet to be reached. Israel's geography is terrible. The main reason is that Israel is surrounded by Egypt, Palestine, and Syria, which are their enemies. The biggest Israel ally, US, is located on the other side of the planet. Therefore, Israel has to invest a big part of their GDP into defense. Comparing to other countries in the Middle East, Israel has almost no oil and gas resources, and only 20% of its land is arable. Another reason is the city of Jerusalem, both Israel and Palestine, claiming the city for their own, has constantly created conflicts.",subjective

I've noticed Gaza being described as an open air prison or concentration camp. And I don't agree with either of those terms, and let me explain why. An open air prison implies that they've done something wrong. When in fact, it's the opposite side. Ethically cleansing, oppressing, and abusing them. Concentration camp is essentially a derivative from what Indian reservations were to the indigenous peoples of America. So I'm going to call it like it is. It's a reservation. And the very, very similar parallels between indigenous peoples of the Americas and Palestinians is a lot deeper than one might seem. Because essentially the reservation system was created in the United States and not only track and monitor the indigenous peoples, but also subjugate them further. Since outright genocide wasn't as seen as popular, so they essentially invented new ways so that they could silently oppress, silently genocide, and silently unalive. The remaining indigenous peoples. And what's been going on with Gaza is that you don't exist if you don't have a registry to the state, if you don't register with military or health agencies that are affiliated with the state. And that's exactly what they did with indigenous peoples. If you didn't have a card, if you weren't logged with the Indian agent, if you weren't logged at all, you didn't exist as an indigenous person. Same thing with food sources. They would take those food sources away that way you could be reliant on the state because one of the things to diminish a people is if you take away their food sovereignty and their agriculture, then you make them reliant on the state and you can control them, you can control their diets, therefore you can control their health. Especially with the surveillance and monitoring, as well as the militarization and dehumanization is parallel to none when it comes to indigenous peoples and Palestinians. Because you have the state actively dehumanizing you, calling you an animal, calling you a savage, all the while monitoring and spying on you, just for no reason. And the same thing, the same technology that's being used in Gaza is imported by the United States via Israeli defense contractors to then spy on indigenous reservations across the Southwest and the Northern borders. So it's like coming from an indigenous perspective, seeing what was done to my ancestors via documentation to my communities, ancestors, and to countless indigenous communities across America. It's very stark seeing it happened before our very eyes, like seeing what was in textbook, seeing what's in our family history happening to other people and has been happening for 75 plus years. So seeing people deny that, seeing people actively dismiss, actively sweep it under the rug, actively side with the pressors and people who are committing genocide against an innocent population, it just hits a different cord, you know, especially if you and your community and your family have been directly affected by it. And this is precisely why I will always say I will stand with my Palestinian brothers and sisters and non-gender conforming relatives. It's because the suffering that your family and your communities have been going through for decades is the same suffering that my community, my family, and our communities have been experiencing for centuries. So the amount of similarities bonds us close together, the amount of solidarity between our communities bonds us close together in our fight to get rid of these colonial oppressors once and for all.",subjective

It's your boy A. Bragg, and I'm back with some news that you need to know. Today, a leaked draft from the High Court of Justice came out showing that out of the 15 members, eight of them voted in favor of nullifying the reasonableness clause or reasonableness law that was put in place earlier this year. The reasonableness clause is an amendment that removes one but not all of the tools that the Supreme Court has in place to stop decisions made by the government or the ministries within the state of Israel that they do not agree with. Law experts and legal advisers stated that this will open the door for more corruption within Israel's government. Critics in July when this came into place stated that it would replace gatekeepers that keep the government in check with Yesman. Citizens protested in voice their opinions stating that this reasonableness law threatens the state of Israel's democracy and pushes it closer to an authoritarianism state. The High Court of Justice members voiced their opinion today saying that this leaked draft was to intimidate all members of the High Court of Justice and to get them to change their ruling and to not void the legislation. Also, let me not forget that when this came into place in July critics of Benjamin Netanyahu stated that these judicial changes he would try to use to void his case or to change the outcome of it. Upon this leaked draft becoming public today many members within the Kineset and the government voiced their opinion stating that this ruling is causing division within the state of Israel. Along with them stating that the state of Israel is in need of unity and not division. Next, the movement for quality government, which is the main petitioner in this case, demanded that the Attorney General Gali Bahrav Meira immediately open a criminal investigation into the leaking of the draft ruling and probe the threats to the Supreme Court President Esher Hayat. This group also went on to claim that the leak is an attempt to intimidate the High Court of Justice and to affect their professional opinions. Going on to slam this as a mafia-like dangerous conduct that suits dark regimes and not a democracy that respects the independence of the Court and the Justices. In response to this, the Finance Minister Benzalow Smotrich, the head of the religious Zionism party, committed that at a time in which the nation is uniting behind the war effort following the October 7th H.W. Group onslaught, there are those who insist on returning us to the discourse of October 6th. Striking down a basic law for the first time in the country's history in a furtive, tight decision is saddening and deepens division. He went on to say further, just like the Kinesit isn't currently advancing contentious laws, it is appropriate and expected of the other branches of the government to follow suit. This is a time for victory and unity. As you can see, even though the state of Israel likes to claim it's a democracy and we know it's not because then that would mean that people have human rights and fundamental freedoms are respected, and we already know that's not the case. Even though we know it's in a part-time state, there are still some people within the government of Israel that believe it's a democracy. Zionists will show up still and make changes to the law so that they have less power, and that people like Benjamin Netanyahu and others can live above the court system and control it, and also conduct criminal-like behavior with no repercussions.",subjective

The day of the operation was meticulously organized into four distinct parts, each playing a crucial role in the unfolding mission. Part one. In the initial phase of the operation, the stage was set for a dramatic and intense start. At around 630 in the morning, a staggering 3,000 rockets was launched from Gaza. This onslaught featured a wide array of rockets including the distinctive homemade Kusam and the Putin-Arainian-made Fagia rockets. The Iron Dome missile defense system sprang into action, and counter almost 60% of the rockets animated in our recent video. Simultaneously, the skies near the border crackled with powered hang gliders and motorized paragliders and infiltrated the border. These unconventional flying machines serve as an unexpected element of surprise, challenging the air defense system. After the fighters aboard the hang gliders landed, they secured the surrounding terrain, enabling an elite commando unit to subsequently breach the fortified electronic and cement wall constructed by Israel. Part two. At 730, a critical juncture of the operation unfolded as fighters executed a coordinated entry into Israeli territory near the Karam-shell on crossing. This crossing held immense significance as it served as a pivotal checkpoint between Israel and Gaza, symbolizing a breach into the heart of Israeli territory. Simultaneously, another group of determined fighters launched an assault on Israel's Ares border crossing station. With calculated precision, they employed explosives to shatter the formidable barriers that had stood in their way. Following this daring act, they swiftly sped across the border on motorbikes. Further enhancing their advance, bulldozers were deployed to widen the gaps created by the explosive breaches facilitating the influx of even more fighters. These additional reinforcements made their entry into Israeli territory aboard four-wheel drives, steadily expanding their presence within the enemy's borders. The stage was set for a multifaceted and meticulously coordinated operation, and they continued their mission deep within Israeli territory. Part three. A commando unit attacked the Israeli armies, southern Gaza headquarters, and jammed its communications thus preventing personnel from calling their commanders or each other. Part four. The final part involved moving hostages to Gaza mostly achieved early in the attack meant for a prisoner exchange.",subjective

It's by far the most prominent building in the Jerusalem skyline, most notable for its iconic golden dome. But is the dome really made of pure gold? This site along with the Al-Uxamaq make up the Al-Uxac compound, which is seen as the third holiest site in the Islamic faith after the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. The rock which is housed by the dome is believed to be the spot where the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him ascended to the heavens during his night journey. Construction of the site was commissioned in the late 7th century under the Kayla Fabdi-Malik bin Mawawan, who was part of the early Omega dynasty which administered this region as Jun-Felustin. Originally the exterior of the dome of the rock was covered by gold, laden, copper and leaded sheets, but in 1016 a violent earthquake hit Jerusalem causing some parts of the dome to collapse on the rock. The dome would be restored in 1022, this time with black lead giving the building a new profile that would endure for the next couple of centuries. This was until the 1960s when the Jordanian government funded a renovation project to replace the letted dome with aluminum plates that were colored gold, turning the dome into its original aesthetic. But we wouldn't see the return of actual gold on the dome until 1993 when the King Hussein of Jordan funded the project with 80 kilograms of gold to be plated onto the dome, with the 24 carats of gold being worth about 8 million dollars, giving us the modern look of the dome today.",subjective

Sure, the IDF pulled out in 2005, but that doesn't mean attacks from the IDF on Palestinians stopped. They've continued for the last 18 years and they continue till this day. Even if I accept the argument that Israel tries to avoid civilian casualties and I'm not convinced of that, they still kill innocent Palestinians in their attacks. Even if I accept the argument that the IDF only have a response with attacks because of terror acts committed by Hamas or other groups, it doesn't matter because their acts are always disproportionate and they always kill innocent Palestinians. That is collective punishment and that is a war crime and it fosters the conditions necessary for groups like Hamas to gain power and commit acts of violence on Israelis in the first place. Israel is responsible. But we don't have to just talk about military attacks. We can talk about the conditions of Gaza as their own form of violence imposed by the Israeli state onto Palestinian people. Gaza has accurately been described as an open air prison and UN agencies estimate that almost 60% of residents in the Gaza Strip require some amount of humanitarian assistance. More than 90% of the water in Gaza is not drinkable and it takes a long time just to get a work permit to leave Gaza. Almost 50% of Gaza are unemployed that is among the highest rates in the world. The median age in Gaza is 18 years old that means half the population at least is 18 years or younger. I don't know how you can blame them for anything. They weren't even alive when the IDF pulled out of Gaza and wouldn't you know just earlier this week food, water, and fuel has been blocked from entering Gaza. That doesn't even touch on how Israel itself is in a partied state. It is designed as a colonial project to subjugate and eventually eradicate Palestinians. Palestinians and Israelis are separated by walls. Military checkpoints they're forced to drive on different roads. It is in a partied state. And I have to urge all of this again. All of these actions hurt Palestinian civilians. People not involved in any terror attacks or violent attacks against Israelis. These are war crimes. All of this that I've just described paired with the history of occupation, dehumanization, and total support from Western powers, breeds the environment necessary for a group like Hamas to thrive. Does this mean that everything Hamas has done is justified? Of course not. But this means the Israeli government is responsible for the conditions that brought them about in the first place and they perpetuate the cycle of violence.

Dozens of armed fighters from Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, crossed into Israel from Gaza in a surprise attack on Saturday the 7th of October. Ending over 700 Israel's according to the government. The attacks by Hamas targeted civilians as well as soldiers and thousands of rockets were also launched by Hamas towards Israel. Israel then responded with airstrikes to Gaza, saying it was targeting militant sites. The United Nations says these airstrikes have displaced 123,000 Palestinians. Gaza health officials say more than 500 people have been ended and over 2,000 have been injured so far. Although Hamas and Israel have been enemies with each other for many years, this is the largest outbreak of violence in decade. If you don't know what Israel is, Israel is a country in the Middle East with a coastline of the Mediterranean Sea. It was created in 1948 following World War II and the Holocaust as a homeland for Jewish people. Since then, there has often been fighting between Israel, the Palestinians, and the neighboring Arab countries, basically overland and who it belongs to. If you don't know what the Gaza Strip is, it's a 25-mile long territory between Israel, Egypt, and the Mediterranean Sea. About 2.3 million people live there and it's ruled by a Palestinian militant group called Hamas. Hamas is the ones that have fought Israel many times. If you don't know what Hamas is, it's a Palestinian is-millis militant group which has ruled Gaza Strip since 2007.

They gathered in a big hall. I could say half of the participants were youth or college students and you had mostly religious right-wing settlers. There at the entrance you had a big map, a huge map showing the different settlements they planned to establish in the Gaza Strip. Some of them literally on top of Palestinian villages and towns that exist and of course unfortunately were destroyed by the Israeli aggression in the recent month. Inside the hall we had speeches of, as you said, ministers, parliament members four out of five of the representatives of four out of five of the parties that are in the coalition of Netanyahu's government were there 11 ministers and 15 parliament members, so a big support from the government and also settlers, the leaders and activists. For me personally the most shocking thing was not only the plan to establish the settlements but the fact that people there were dancing and singing, being happy and joyful and this is important to understand that in the Israeli public atmosphere this is something you barely see since the attack of 7 of October. You don't see public events where people are joyful not because most of the Israeli public ignored the horrific reality in Gaza but because of the war because of the attack of 7 October because Israeli soldiers are being killed every day in the war. You don't see many of those events and it shocked even mainstream Israelis to see ministers and people who take into those decisions regarding the dancing was very shocking for many people and I think this is because while the vast or big parts of the Israeli public is still in shock the settler movement sees this war as an opportunity to expand their plans to settle in Gaza. The war itself is horrific enough but I'm afraid that this rhetoric by members of the government in carriage or gives the feeling to the soldiers on the ground they can do anything because if Israel according to this conference will eventually control the Gaza Strip it means soldiers on the ground and we've seen that on TikTok on Instagram social media can do whatever they want because it belongs to Israel so they can explode houses they can vandalize they can steal property they can do whatever they want because this adventure will be Israeli property.",subjective

A week earlier, the Egyptian forces had successfully crossed the Suez Canal, pushed 10 kilometers deep and liberated part of their occupied Sinai peninsula. Then they remained within a defensive umbrella and easily repelled every Israeli-attempted counterattack to push them back across the canal. In the first week of the war, the Israeli suffered casualties at an unprecedented rate, 500 tanks and 70 aircraft, to an Egyptian army, willing to revenge for its humiliating defeat in the Six-Day War. Dug in, and well protected by minefields, behind an anti-tank and anti-aircraft missile screen. All the Egyptians had to do now was to wait for the ceasefire according to plan. But they suddenly had an enormous problem, their ally Syria. Syria was not experiencing the same degree of success. Not only the Syrian forces had failed to secure their objectives on liberating the Golan Heights, but also the Israelis were now smashing them and advancing toward their capital Damascus. Syria sent distress calls urging her Egyptian ally to do something to relieve the pressure. Hoping to draw Israeli forces away from Syria, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat ordered his forces to launch a massive armored offensive in the Sinai. In a gigantic pincer movement aimed at smashing the Israeli forces guarding the passes through the Sinai mountains. But all the Egyptian commanders objected to that decision, and for two days argued against this move fearing to leave the safety of their air defense umbrella that covered only 10 miles deep into Sinai. But it was a political decision that they had to implement, as they were threatened if they don't obey the president's order its tantamount to mutiny. That would have them court-martialed. So the Egyptian commanders had no choice but to acquiesce. And the attack was scheduled for the 14th of October. The Egyptians were committing their biggest mistake of the war, as the Israelis knew they were coming, and were ready for them, thanks to their American allies. An American spy plan the SR-71 Blackbird. On October 13th had photographed the Egyptian front with high-resolution cameras. Reconnaissance pictures showed the Egyptian reserve tanks crossing the canal to the other side in order to start the attack. On 14th October, 25 miles east of the canal, 800 Israeli tanks were well dug in on high ground on prepared defensive position on the ridges waiting for the Egyptians. Across the open desert they could see the sand being kicked up by 400 advancing Egyptian tanks. And here started one of the biggest tank battles in history. The Israelis opened fire on the Egyptians who were totally exposed to withering fire. Nevertheless the Egyptian fought valiantly, dashing through heavy Israeli fire. The Egyptian tanks repeatedly tried to push further east into the Sinai. And despite being outnumbered, they successfully managed to hit the Israelis, opening a gap through their lines and achieving a breakthrough in the southern sector. But as the Egyptians moved out this far beyond the protective cover of their air defense umbrella, Israeli aircrafts rained down bombs on the exposed Egyptian tanks. The Israelis through skillful use of their tank guns pulverized the Egyptians exposed down on the open ground. And after eight hours of fierce fighting, the Egyptians stopped their attack and retreated. The Israelis managed to knock down 250 Egyptian tanks and lost only 100 of their own. This Israeli victory was the turning point of the war. The Egyptians lost their reserve tanks in this battle, so their army in Sinai had nothing behind it on the other side to protect its rear. So the Israeli plan was to get to the canal, cross over it to the empty other side behind the Egyptian forces in Sinai, to tear it up from the inside out. But in order to do so, they first must open a gap in the Egyptian formations to be able to cross to the other side. And this was the most ferocious battle of the war. This battle is the one that convinced the Israelis to make peace with Egypt after the war ended, because memories of that brutal fight will haunt the Israelis forever. For the nightmarish experience they had, fighting the Egyptians in the Battle of the Chinese Army. But that's a story for a different time.",subjective

Both religions declare Abraham as the father of their faith. According to the Old Testament, God told Abraham and his people to settle in a land called Canaan, which is in the approximate region of what we call today Israel. It was given that name after Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel by God. Now King Saul established the Israelite monarchy, and that continued under King David. This happened around 1,000 BC before the birth of Christ. And it continued on with his son Solomon, who built the first Jewish temple. And Solomon built this temple in Jerusalem. This is where it all begins. This temple is part of the Jewish claim to the land of Israel. According to the Jews, this temple, and this land belongs to them. According to the promise of God, two Abraham, their father. Now all throughout Old Testament, this land will continue to be conquered by various groups. It continues to be fought over by various kingdoms and nations, all throughout the history of the Old Testament. This include Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Egyptians, Fatimids, the Crusaders, and so forth. This region ultimately was just called Palestine. This Palestine or this place or this land would become very sacred to both Jews, Arabs, and including Christians. While these kingdoms were overcoming the Jews, in this land, this caused a diaspora for the Jews to spread out, mostly all throughout Europe. But from this diaspora, this caused the Jews to be oppressed in these European lands. So in the 1880s, the Jews started immigrating back to the Promised Land. So when the Jews came back to their Promised Land, this was all underneath the Palestinian control, also known as the Arabs. So by 1914, more than 75,000 Jews migrated back to Israel. After World War I, Great Britain then took control of this land. It became part of the British Empire. In 1922, the League of Nations came up with a promise to the Jewish people to give them their own state. But it took about two decades for this promise to come to pass. 1939, World War II, it broke out. More than six million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust, with millions more displaced. The Jews have had their fair share of a fight. So after that, in about 1947, the UN decided to partition Israel. We have the Jewish state of Israel and the Arab state of Palestine. Two opposite groups living on the same land, fighting for the same land. So now that you have that brief history, let's go back to the Bible. Both set sea Abraham as their father. The Muslim sea Abraham's first son Ishmael or Ishmael as their founding father. While the Jews recognized their founding father, Isaac Abraham's second born son. The son that God said would be your promised child. Now Abraham was married to a woman named Sarah or Sarai. Sarah couldn't have children. Or I should say she had not born children to Abraham yet. She was very old when the promise came to her that she would have a son. This son's name would be Isaac. Are they were waiting on this promise to be fulfilled? Sarah came up with this grand idea that Abraham should have a child by her servant, Hagar. That's how Ishmael came. Or Ishmael, however you want to pronounce it. So if the Jews are the descendants of Isaac, then the promise goes to them. The Muslims proclaim to be the descendants of Ishmael. They feel the promise goes to them. But what does God say? So now we have a war. The Jews have been attacked since the first attack from the Amalakites. After they crossed the Red Sea, I did a video on this. It was an unprovoked attack. They were originally attacked and captured by the Egyptians. And that's when they were enslaved for 400 years. But God had already told Abraham this was going to happen. He did this with the purpose. God told Abraham that your descendants will be enslaved for 400 years because the sins of the Amalakites had not come to pass yet. God's plan was to judge them Amalakites. So because of his long suffering, the Amalakites had to sin and sin and sin and come against God with their idolatry. So in that time, the Israelites were enslaved in Egypt and they grew and grew and grew while they were enslaved. They became a mighty people. Moses comes along and frees them from Pharaoh. They crossed the Red Sea. God leads them into the wilderness, which we know as Sinai, or the wilderness of Sin, S-I-N, not sin, but Sin. God leads them up the mountain of Mount Sinai. This is where he gives them the Ten Commandments and he appears in front of the Israelite children for the first time. Prior to this event, he had only appeared to Moses and Moses would give the instructions from God onto the Israelite children. God had promised them that he would lead them to the Promised Land, which is the land of milk and honey, also known as the Land of Canaan. They had to fight many nations for this land. God made promises to them and said as long as that they did not adopt the customs of the pagan nations that were surrounding them, he would be on their side. Israel defied God by adopting these rituals and these customs of the surrounding pagan nations. So God had left Israel, meaning he stopped protecting them after a while. 500 years after the death of Christ, here comes a man named Muhammad. But before Muhammad was born, we have some issues going on with the Jews. God sent his son, the Messiah, the one that was prophesied, the one that the Jews were hoping to come and save them from their oppressors. When Jesus came, they didn't recognize him as the Messiah. They rejected him and nailed him to the cross. So this day, those Jews that do not accept Jesus Christ as their Messiah, they still reject Jesus Christ. So now we have the Christians. They were established after the Book of Acts. The word Christian comes from the Greek word, Cristanos, which basically means little Christ. It was a derogatory word back then. They had nail Jesus Christ to the cross and they kind of like mocked his followers and believers. They caught them, you little Christ. It was a bad word. So the first church has now been established for the early church. This land is important to the Christians because it is the very same land of where Christ was born and a lot of his miracles had occurred and where his prophets taught. It's important to the Jews because it is the land that was promised by Abraham. Same land where the prophets of the Old Testament reside it. It's definitely a holy land. Now about almost 600 years later, a man who goes by the prophet Muhammad, he was born 600 years after the death of Christ. He proclaims to be the prophet that God had sent. Muslims and Jews do not recognize Jesus to be the Messiah. They both recognize Jesus to be like a teacher or a prophet. Anyhow, this man Muhammad proclaims that his founding father or his forefather, I should say, not founding father, but his forefather was Ishmael, Abraham's first son. Now I'm going to get attacked by you. Hebrew Israelites on this, this is the history. The Hebrew Israelites say that these Jews are not the original Jews, that they're not the real Jews. This is not their land or even the real land. Muslims say that this is their land. Jews say that this is their land. Christians say that this is their land. It's all just one big fight. But the Bible shows that Israel has always been attacked and they always will. Israel belongs to God. Now some people are going to say that it's not necessarily the land of Israel. It's the people and not necessarily the people that live in Israel today. That's the argument of the Hebrew Israelites. They say that blacks are their original Hebrews. That's a completely different discussion. Moses did marry an Ethiopian woman. The Bible tells us that Moses was not black. He was Hebrew. So essentially he had mixed kids because the Bible shows us and tells us countless times that the Israelite children married into other nations. They integrated into other parts of cultures. And even assimilated into other customs. Doesn't matter the race or the nationality. None of that matters. Especially when it comes to Christ. We are all God's children, those that accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, according to the Bible. I don't truly understand why the Muslims or the Palestinians believe that this land belongs to them. If God promised this land to Abraham's descendants through the line of Isaac, it is true that this land belongs to the Israelites. And God knows who they are. It doesn't matter about this land. Because when Jesus Christ comes, none of this is going to matter. When He finally chains up Satan and puts him in the lake of fire, we'll get a new world anyways.",subjective

That news that ABC News is confirmed, Iran launching an attack on Israel, a dramatic escalation of violence in the region. U.S. officials confirming that U.S. forces have shot down some of those Iranian drones headed towards Israel. At this hour, you can see some of the videos. Some of those Iranian projectiles have reached Israel. Air raid sirens heard in Jerusalem and elsewhere throughout the country. Iran's are being heard, Israel's defense is intercepting. Iran had vowed to retaliate for Israel's deadly strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria 12 days ago, killing 13 people, including several top Iranian military leaders. Israel has been on high alert for days now. President Biden cutting short his weekend in Delaware, returning to the White House, meeting with his national security team in the situation room. Let's get right to ABC's brick clinic. The news is that the Israeli military is in Israel. I understand you're in Jerusalem and at times you even had to take shelter. Describe what you're seeing right now. Yeah, so about an hour ago, we were seeing trails of orange, these orange flashes in the sky. And then the third of Israel's air defense in action. It almost sounded like thunder. There was at least a dozen projectiles in all directions behind me. A drone's possibly rockets appearing to head west. Now they were intercepted by air defense probably every few minutes over a period of 15 minutes. There will also air raid sirens wailing over Jerusalem. It's a tense atmosphere here tonight. We don't know how many more might be coming or whether the air defense systems might be overwhelmed. There are just too many unknowns. There's also danger of falling debris when those projectiles are intercepted. It does feel like an ominous escalation here tonight, Whit. Yes, we've been here in reports of the potential hundreds of drones and or missiles on their way to Israel. And Brit, just to clarify at this moment, do we have any word that any of these projectiles have actually landed or hit infrastructure or buildings? There are reports, Whit, but nothing confirmed yet.

And in 2019, there's a quote where Netanyahu is addressing his comrades in the Lecude party, and he said the following quote, anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas. What Netanyahu wants to do is make sure that no political forces rise in Gaza or elsewhere in Palestine that can garner more support from the world in pursuit of being recognized as human beings, being recognized as a fully independent nation. And so, of course, he wants to keep the money flowing to Hamas. It's very good for his business, for his agenda. It's also very good for both the United States and the Israeli war agenda and war industries. You also have the reality that for 75 years, Israel has operated a murderous campaign against the Palestinian people aimed at making sure they will never get an independent homeland. And when you do things as occurred in 2018 and 2019, like gunning down, repeatedly gunning down non-violent protesters who participated in the weekly Friday marches on the great march of return, when you see how Palestinians are treated, when they do what the world or what others say they should do, oh, protest non-violently, don't take up arms, they're gunned down by Netanyahu's forces. So, why is there a group like Hamas? Why was there a group like the African National Congress? Why was there a group like the Irish Republican Army? Why would people support vicious entities like Hamas? Well, because they've been stripped of every possible other means of resistance by their occupiers, by settler colonial powers. So, when we want to talk about why is there a Hamas? Part of it is people like Netanyahu and Netanyahu personally supporting the rise of Hamas and the sustaining Hamas. And the other part of it is 75 years of history of constantly mass-occurring Palestinians and showing them that non-violent protests also will not be tolerated.",subjective

Israel went all out, showing off their military skills. They hit Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, and even took over some new territory. When the dust settled, Israel was looking pretty good. They captured the Sinai Peninsula, the West Bank, and the Golan Heights. The Six Day War was a game-changer in the Middle East.

October 6th, the onset of what came to be called the Yom Kippur War. At the center of the struggle were Israel, a growing nation-state and Egypt, a regional powerhouse. Egyptian forces led by President Anwar Sadat initiated a surprise attack in collaboration with Syria, targeting Israel on its most sacred holiday, the Yom Kippur. They sought to reclaim territory previously lost in the Six Day War of 1967. This attack gave Egypt the advantage of surprise, and they hoped it would be instrumental in disabling the Israeli Air Force, considered one of the strongest in the region. Early into the combat, the Egyptian forces seemed to be dominating with their ground forces and air strikes overpowering the Israeli defenders. However, the Israeli combat strategy, a combination of resilience, courage and quick adaptation, could stall work against the onslaught. Israel, under its scrupulous defense minister Moshe Dianne and stubborn chief of staff David Elazar, had managed to build a relatively strong missile defense network known as Operation Kurnas. This was the first level of defense against incoming Egyptian aerosolts, as the Egyptian aircraft descended to attack their imposing Mirage and Phantom fighter jets were met with the shocking fury of Israeli radars and air-to-air missiles. Distaining heavy losses the Egyptian Air Force was compelled to withdraw and rethink its strategy. Meanwhile, using the intimate knowledge of enemy tactics, Israeli pilots infiltrated the Egyptian airspace, targeting runways, fuel depots and air defense systems. Israel's decisive counter-strike known as Operation Taeger was as swift and surprising as the Egyptian initial assault had been. The weeks that followed saw more Egyptian aircraft shot down, causing morale to plummet within the Egyptian ranks. Meanwhile, Israeli confidence soared. Their audacious strategy of focusing on the enemy's offensive capabilities, rather than directly defending territorial ground proved extraordinarily effective. By the time the United Nations brokered a ceasefire on October 25, 1973, Egypt was no longer able to launch an effective counter-attack. In a surprising turn of events, they found themselves cornered into accepting ceasefire terms. Once it's fair to say that Israel had again proven the resilience and agility of their Air Force despite the harshest of adversities demonstrating their strategic prowess to the world. It's important to note though that while war stories can be undeniably fascinating, they also remind us of the costs and devastation brought by conflicts. As such, these chronicles from history should serve to highlight the vital importance of diplomacy, mutual respect, and enduring peace.",subjective

Te cuento de la manera más objetiva posible. El conflicto entre Israel y Palestina tiene más de 100 años. Y como casi todos los problemas de oriente medio, todos son por peleas por territorio y por cuestionar religiosas. Para entenderlo tenemos que guardar cuando Palestina estaba bornada por el imperio tomano. Palestina formaba parte del imperio tomano. Y en esta época, en Palestina vivían musulmanes, cristianos y judíos pacíficamente. La cosa es que después de la primera guerra mundial, el imperio tomano, Cae y los británicos, toman el control de Palestina. Y para conseguir apoyos hacen un trato con los árabes y con los judíos de esa región, Prometiéndoles a los dos cosas contradictorias. Por un lado, prometen a los árabes que obtendrían la independencia Y el autogobierno Palestina. Y a los judíos del establecimiento de uno garnacional para el pueblo judío también en Palestina. O sea, un estado para ellos. Así empieza el conflicto. Además, esto es un tema que se conoce como sionismo. Un movimiento político que tenía como objetivo, Quiere alguien mantener un estado judío en la tierra de Israel. Y es que recuerda que las tres religiones cristianismo, judaísmo e islam, Están conectadas de alguna manera a la región de Palestina a Israel. Para los judíos, como lo dice en la Biblia, La tierra a Israel es lo que llaman la tierra prometida. Y es la que Dios promete a Abraham, el fundador del pueblo judío y a sus descendientes. Para los cristianos es donde pasar a los cementos más importantes en la vida de Jesús, Como sonacimientos, sucrucifixion y su resurrección. En Jerusalén. Y para los sus urmanes, el profeta más o más realizó un viaje desde la meca a Jerusalén Y ascendió al cielo desde el monte del templo, que esto también al Jerusalén. Y caso, después de que los británicos acabas sin con el imperio tomano, Para cumplir su trato, estieron a los judíos algunas tierras en Palestina. Encima que a veces van llegando más y más judíos que huían de Europa por la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Claro, los araves cada vez estaban más mosqueados y se resistieron violentamente. Entonces los británicos vieron que la situación se les estaba yendo de las manos. Y en 1947, después de haber estado 30 años controlando Palestina, Cender el control de la situación a las naciones unidas. Vamos, que se deshantiende. La Auroprópose dividir Palestina 2, una parte para los araves y otra para los judíos. Y la capital Jerusalén para la UNO. Israel proclamos su estadounidense, pero los araves palestinos, apoyados por la Reciincreada Liga, Aravén, como Bostá por Egipto, Siria, Lívano, Irak y Transjordania, Tijeron que ni de Koña. Y declararon a la guerra al Reciincreado estado de Israel. Pero los judíos estaban mejor organizados de lo que los araves creían. Y además de ganar la guerra, se quedaron con un 23% más de lo que les ha sido la UNO. Hubo varias masacres por parte de las fuerzas irrealías y 200 timos de mil araves tuvieron que abandonar el país. Israel se había hecho con la mayor parte de la Tierra es Tectogaza, que quedó bajo el control de Egipto. Y de su oranía que quedó bajo el control de Jordania. Desde entonces había mas y mas intentos dividir la Tierra, pero no se llegó a ganar a Ectertoa más de olencia. Hasta 1967, después de una guerra de 6 días entre Israel y varios países araves. Israel finalmente capturó los territorios palestinos de Cisjordania, Gaza, los otros del Golán, que eran Sirios y la Pilínseo del Sinai de Egipto, que acabaron devolviendo luego bajo un tratado de paz. Que a 10 años después de esto, estalló lo que se conoce como la primera intifada, que significa levantamiento o agitación. Aquí el pueblo palestino se reveló contra la ocupación y represión en Israel y Cisjordania en la franja de Gaza. Y esta primera intifada llevó a la formación de Jamás, un grupo militante extremista para muchos, un grupo terrorista, que dice defender los derechos de los palestinos y que ahora es noticia por el nuevo ataque que ha lanzado Israel. En 2007 jamás empezó a controlar Gaza y Israel estableció un bloqueo en la zona. La situación es parecida en Cisjordania, donde varias zonas están gobernadas por la autoridad nacional palestina, pero cada vez hay más sentamientos judíos, que son comunidades judías construidas en tierras que los palestinos reclaman. Estos sentamientos son bastante polémicos porque la comunidad internacional es considera como elevales. Y es que Israel ha ido poco a poco hasta nuestros días sembrando de judíos el suelo palestino. Se ha entresdejado el movimiento, el acceso a la agua, la electricidad, etc. Y Israel también ha construido alrededor de Cisjordania un muro de separación que separa a miles de palestinos de los servicios sociales, colegios y tierras de cultivo. Y otra cosa que tener en cuenta es que hay un desequilibrio de poder entre Israel y Palestina, ya que Israel cuenta con el apoyo militar de Estados Unidos y tiene un ejército muy fuerte. En los últimos años, las tensiones entre los Israelis en estas zonas y los palestinos han ido en aumento. Y ahora que está ya dola guerra entre jamás y Israel, vemos como gente que está expresando su apoyo a Palestina y otros Israel. Pero lo realmente importante de todo esto es que millones de personas, sobre todo civiles, de ambos bandos, que son inocentes, están sufriendo y muriendo cada día.

The Syrians were driven back with Israeli troops seizing its strategically important goal on heights.

This is the first time an Arab state attacked Israel up until then Israel was always the aggressor. In 1973 and the reason why Egypt does finally attack Israel is because they wanted the Sinai back. Israel captured the Sinai in the Sixth Day War and it's a catastrophe for Egypt. In part because most of its natural gas and all of its oil was in the Sinai. So it immediately cut off Egypt oil poor, natural gas poor state from its energy resources. Another reason why they want the Sinai back so desperately is as long as the Israeli military is on one side of the Suez Canal and Egyptian military is on the other side of the Suez Canal, it's shut down. The Israeli is actually sank ships in the Suez Canal to prevent any traffic from going through. As long as no traffic is going through Egypt isn't getting that revenue because all the ships that go through have to pay Egypt for passage. And so without that revenue, it's actually stifling Egypt's economy. So Egypt has to attack Israel to get that territory back because it's a matter of life and death economically. And they do. During the war, Egypt basically destroys the Israeli Sinai military in two days. It's a catastrophe for these Israelis. It's a repeat of the 67 war except it's reverse. It's the Israeli's getting punk this time. Kisadir calls up Israel and says, hey, I'm here for you. We're going to be there side by side during your surrender negotiations as you give up the Sinai to Egypt. Israel went absolutely not on a no circumstances will we ever negotiate from a position of weakness. If you want us to negotiate, you have to help us militarily first. So we literally fly every tank that we have available. We spray off. We used to put white stars on a tank. We spray them off. The Israelis put on a triangle. And we fly these tanks to Israel. We immediately rearm Israel with a tank army. The Israelis jump into tanks. Kisadir calls them on. And goes, all right, now you're in a position of strength. Let's negotiate. Israel goes, no, no, no. We have to punk Egypt first. We can't have been losing the war and be in a position of strength. We have to be winning the war. And so they counterattack. They cut the Egyptian Sinai army in half. They cross the Suez Canal. And they're charging into Egypt proper. The Soviet Union calls the United States. Just want you to know, the Israeli army is getting way too close to Damascus and way too close to Cairo. If they go any further, if the Israelis cross the 100 kilometer mark inside Egypt proper on the west side of the Suez Canal, we're going in. And they had a line for Damascus as well. We're going in. Kisadir calls up Israel. Hey, you got to tell you. It's really sad, but the Soviets have told us they're going to go in. You should know we're not coming in after them. This is just going to be you against the Soviet Union. Probably not going to work out real well for you, but we're not going to start World War III over this. You should have surrendered. You tricked me. And now I've given you this army. And now you're using it in a way I didn't mean for you to use. And now you're about to start World War III. We're not going to do this. You're on your own. So the Israelis, when they got to the 100 kilometer mark, they brought a road cutter with them. You've seen them. They got the big wheel on the ground. And they cut a strip of highway out of the road at the 100 kilometer mark and took it back to a museum in Israel to show that they had been in 100 kilometers. And then they stopped. Just as the Soviet paratroopers were loading into the airplanes, the Israelis stopped. Kissinger goes, all right, now let's negotiate. So these guys go, yep, we're ready. It's good. So Kissinger then flies to Syria. He goes to President Hafiz Alassad, the father of the current Syrian tyrant. He goes to Hafiz Alassad, and he says, look, I want to make a comprehensive peace deal. I want to make it so there's never another Arab Israeli war. I want to make it so that the Middle East becomes the stable beacon of hope for the whole planet. What I want to do is I want to make a comprehensive deal that includes Israel, the Palestinians, Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, Lebanon, everybody. We're going to get everybody a table. We're going to sit them down. And we're going to make some kind of deal that sets up the Palestinians so that they're not a stateless people stuck in refugee camps for all eternity. We're going to do something that makes the Israelis feel secure. We're going to get you the Golan Heights back. We're going to get Egypt the Sinai back. We're going to figure out what Jordan's water rights are to the Jordan River, all of this, all thing. And Hafiz Alassad is like, wow, you're going to do this for real. This is incredible. I'm on board. I will support the United States any way I can. This is remarkable. Kissinger's like, thank you so much. Jumps on an airplane. Fly to Egypt. So Kissinger just sits down with Sadat and says, so I've been talking to everybody. I talk to the Palestinians. I talk to the Israelis. I talk to the Syrians. I talk to the Jordanians. I got to tell you, it's grim. It's grim. The Syrians don't want to cooperate. The Jordanians don't want to cooperate. The Palestinians don't want to cooperate. Look, the only way forward is to abandon everybody. And make a separate peace deal with the Israelis. Just Egypt and Israel. Because nobody else is going to work with you. They're all only thinking about themselves. They're going to backstab you. It's bad. Isn't this amazing? This is US diplomacy. Now it's finest. So that goes, OK, I guess what am I going to do? I can't fight the United States. I had to fight the United States military. We were defeated. We beat the Israeli military. It took us two days. But who can fight the United States? I'm going to surrender. I'm going to make a separate peace deal. Hava Zalasad, here's what Kissinger has done. That Egypt's going to make a separate peace deal. He freaks out. He feels betrayed, backstabbed. He can't believe it. Kissinger came with all these promises. And the next thing you know, he's doing the opposite. It is cemented. Syria hates the United States. The Syrian government hates the United States. The Syrian government is going to be pro-Soviet and later pro-Russian for all eternity. Because in the mind of the president and the later his son, there is no way to work with the United States because we are liars and manipulators. The reason why Kissinger did it with Kissinger believed that the way you created security for the United States was you created chaos in the rest of the world. Your goal was to upend the global system, shake it, break it, make it so there was so much chaos that nobody could have a coherent foreign policy. And then the United States could operate in that chaos. Get countries pitted against each other, split alliances. He split the Egyptian Syrian alliance. Egypt was never a real full-fledged ally of the Soviet Union, but it was the Soviet Union that armed Egypt. It was the Soviet Union that was willing to back up Egypt, to step up when Egypt was in trouble. Kissinger wanted to break that too. And what he wanted to do was peel Egypt out of this pan-air, absecular socialist thing and bring it into the US camp. When they finally get the peace deal going, and then later on, the Carter administration picks it up and runs with it. One of the things they promised Egypt is that Egypt will work with Israel. It will trade with Israel. It will normalize relations with Israel. Egypt will never fight Israel again. In return, whatever the United States is giving Israel an official foreign aid, it will give Egypt half of that and foreign aid. So to this day, Egypt and Israel combined get one-third of the entire US foreign aid package. Two countries get one-third. Israel gets two shares for every Egyptian share. But the whole thing is based on the role that Israel plays in creating chaos in the Middle East. And the role that the United States then doesn't have to play because it's Israel that's doing the chaos.",subjective

Nanyahu trained as a combat soldier and served for five years in the Israeli Defense Forces in the Special Combat Unit. Nanyahu then returned to the United States and actually studied at MIT. After returning to Israel in the late 70s, Nanyahu got involved in politics as a representative to the United Nations. In 1999, he became the first Israeli Prime Minister to be elected directly by the popular globe. Nanyahu has been in and out of power since then.

The most powerful intelligence organization in the world in terms of reach is the Chinese MSS, the Ministry of State Security, because they have created a single solitary intelligence service that has global reach and is integrated with Chinese culture, so that essentially every Chinese person anywhere in the world is an informant to the MSS, because that's their way of serving the middle kingdom, the jungle, the central kingdom, the Chinese word for China. So they're the strongest, the most powerful intelligence service in terms of reach. Most assets, most informants, most intelligence is deeply integrated with the citizenry, correct with their culture. You know what a Chinese person who lives in Syria thinks of themselves as a Chinese person? Do you know what a Chinese person, a Chinese national living in the United States thinks of themselves as a Chinese person, right? Americans living abroad often think of ourselves as expats, expatriates, living on the local economy, embracing the local culture that is not how Chinese people view traveling around the world. And by the way, if I may mention, I believe the way Masad operates is similar kind of thing, because people from Israel living abroad still think of themselves as Jewish and Israeli first, so that allows you to integrate the culture and the faith-based aspects, exactly right. But the number of people in Israel is much, much more. Exactly right. The number of people in China. So when it comes to reach, China wins that game. When it comes to professional capability, it's the CIA by far, because budget-wise, capability-wise, weapon system-wise, modern technology-wise, CIA is the leader around the world, which is why every other intelligence organization out there wants to partner with CIA. They want to learn from CIA. They want to train with CIA. They want to partner on counter-narcotics and counter-drug and counter-terrorism and counter-weager. You name it, people want to partner with CIA. So CIA is the most powerful in terms of capability and wealth. And then you've got the idea, you've got tech. So tech alone, meaning corporate espionage, economic espionage, nothing beats DGSE in France. They're the top. They've got a massive budget that almost goes exclusively to stealing foreign secrets. They're the biggest threat to the United States, even above Russia and above China. DGSE in France is a massively powerful intelligence organization, but they're so exclusively focused on a handful of types of intelligence collection that nobody even really thinks that they exist. And then in terms of just terrifying violence, you have Mossad. Mossad will do anything. But has no qualms doing what it takes to ensure the survival of every Israeli citizen around the world. Most other countries will stop at some point, but Mossad doesn't do that. So it's the lies you're willing to cross. And the reasons that you're willing to cross them, you know, this CIA will let Americans stay in jail in Russia, unlawfully, and seek a diplomatic solution. I mean, the United States has led people. There are two gentlemen in the 1950s who were imprisoned in China for 20 years, waiting for diplomatic solutions to their release. So that's it's we do not kill to save a citizen.

This is the moment Iranian missiles were launched at Israel. As they began to arrive in Israeli airspace, silence pierced the night sky. Most of the over 300 Iranian drones, crews, and ballistic missiles were intercepted by Israel's powerful aerial defense systems, and it helped from US, UK, French, and Jordanian fighter jets. But a few missiles did break through, causing minimal damage to an airbase, and leaving a seven-year-old girl badly injured in southern Israel. In Tehran, regime supporters celebrated the operation, which was in retaliation for an Israeli air strike on one of Iran's diplomatic buildings in Syria, earlier this month, that killed several senior revolutionary guard commanders. President Biden monitored events as they unfolded with his national security team. Hey, you guys are the best in the whole damn world. And he called members of the 494th and 335th fighter squadrons to praise them for aiding in Israel's defense. Thank you, Mr. President. While in another call with Benjamin Netanyahu, the President reportedly told the Israeli Prime Minister to, quote, take the win for successfully fending off the Iranian assault and that he would oppose any Israeli counterattack on Iran.

Just last week Israeli forces killed at least 12 Palestinians, including three children during raids in Shaniq. Then two Hamas affiliate gunmen opened fire on a bus up in Jerusalem. Since October 7th, at least 240 Palestinians have been killed and another 2850 injured by Israeli forces and settlers in the West Bank, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. We spoke to an Israeli organization dedicated to documenting human rights violations in the occupied territories about the uptick in violence. The situation in the West Bank is basically a military occupation, a military rule, which means that Israel is controlling the population in all ways. Settlement to enterprises, the project of Israel started way before Netanyahu. This is something that they encouraged in many ways also in things like tax, taxing and other benefits to encourage population to move into the West Bank. Israel's occupation of the West Bank began in June of 1967 after the Six Day War. At the time, the UN issue resolution 242, which called for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank, both of which did not happen at the time. Instead, Israeli communities have taken root in the West Bank and continue to expand, often into territory that Palestinians have titled to. At the end of the day, Israel and the settlers are aiming for the same purpose, and it is to take over Palestinian lands and allocate it for Jews. They both do it in different ways. Israel is taking over Palestinian lands. Bi official means that meaning they can declare state lands of a Palestinian land. They can declare firing zones or archaeological sites or nature reserves. All kinds of legal means to take over the land. Then the settlers are doing this by illegal means, which is to just take over the land, see from the land, and then attack the Palestinians around it until they leave. One thing is important to say about those tactics, the settlers and the state, that you don't have to put people on track for it to be a forceful transverse. Before October 7th, this year was already on track to be the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank in over 15 years, according to UN data. The number of Palestinians killed since October 7th accounts for a third of the death to 123. And the UN found that in nearly half of these incidents, Israeli forces were either accompanying or actively supporting the attackers. We're talking about the Taliban documented 16 communities that in four weeks left entirely. So in a way, you can stay like they're doing this, right? They're completing the test.",subjective

You are killing all these kids and you can't even, you can't even tell you all. You can't even throw your own kids. Never mind the fact that your own military is so bad. So bad at their job that they they they had to stage a headquarters or I'm sorry, a meeting spot. And then on top of that, they missed so many marks in it, especially in living in a digital age. You would think with all the boasting and tick-tocking that the IDF and IOS have been doing that, you know, maybe they would be a little bit better at being able to scrub and beat these things to the internet, but honey, it's going down. Okay, on the other side of town and streets is talking and but the streets is saying that show on Sunday, don't even like you. Your folks, they don't know what to do. They don't all this crazy stuff. Nicky getting caught up in lies. Baby is falling apart right before our eyes. Like I said, I'm not going to get too, too, too excited, but it's like as each day passes by more and more credibility is lost on their end. So it's at the point where it's only a matter of time before it completely unravels because you've lost practically all of your supporters. Not practically you have. You've lost all of your supporters except America. England is still on offense, but everybody else they have jumped ship. You're losing artillery and you went through the majority of your, you know, the stuff that you already got over there. I honestly don't think that the five day pause had anything to do with the House of Justice, giving them some time to regroup and think about things and then also get more military support over there. You know, come up with another plan, find a way to spread more misinformation. IE fabricated troops. Thank you, Donald for that. But I just thought that this was hilarious because I think this show sign. You all hear quote in the Bible, but you didn't even get this one right. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying. If God don't do nothing else, he's going to do whatever he can to use the people around you to get to you. So I'm saying it's all I'm saying, baby, that foundation is crumbling like a house of cards and sooner or later it's going to have to come crumbling down. And then what is the American army in Israel going to have to say in order to defend themselves in this situation because baby, we not stop and even win your stop. We want all this stuff changed. And even your own son can tell there's something right in the water. That's sad.",subjective

Flags everywhere, and as you can see, we're being watched all the time. There's like snipers, people are watching us. This is insane man.

He sides with Palestine.

Now, if you ask me, it's some trouble going on on the home front and the son is like, he's just as, you know, he's just as a little chemically unbalanced as his father is. So he's more than likely making sure he's standing on business by selling his daddy out to the highest bidder.

Because Israel is attacking yet another hospital in Northern Gaza. This time, the Israeli target is Gaza's Indonesian hospital, a hospital located in Northern Gaza that currently has upwards of 700 people inside of the hospital itself, as well as an estimated 6,000 people, including staff, patients and those taking shelters on the hospital grounds. This is a hospital that has already been bombed repeatedly by Israeli forces, with at least 2 civilians being killed in strikes between October 7th and October 28th according to Human Rights Watch. And it is as if today being surrounded by tanks and being sheld in at least one instance by artillery that's killed upwards of 12 people. You heard that right. According to number 1 of Dala, a medical worker at the Indonesian hospital, Israeli tanks have been operating less than 200 meters from the hospital, and Israeli snipers have been seen on roofs of nearby buildings. That in and of itself is incredibly troubling, especially given Israel's raid on the El Shifa hospital only a few days ago. But it has escalated since the shell struck the second floor of the Indonesian hospital, killing at least 12 people, according to a medical worker inside of the facility in the health ministry in Gaza. That news is incredibly horrific, and another example of many of Israeli forces deliberately targeting hospitals in the Gaza Strip. These attacks on hospitals, including the broad cutting off of medical supplies, as well as food and water to the Gaza Strip by Israeli forces, has led to at least 21 of Gaza's 35 hospitals, including the Strip Solo Cancer Center being completely out of service, with others having been damaged and being short of medicines and essential supplies. It's critical to note in these instances as well that the targeting of these hospitals as far from accidental, this is a deliberate policy by Israel to bring about maximal suffering to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Israeli military officials know very well that these hospitals are sites where people are getting cared for for for their injuries, as well as places people are seeking refuge from this ongoing violence. They are targeting these sites because of that. This is one facet of Israel's larger genocidal decision making in the Gaza Strip. Despite they want Palestinians to be scared constantly to not feel as if there is a single place in the Gaza Strip where they are safe. That's why Israel has been targeting these hospitals, as well as residential buildings, mosques, schools, churches, things of this nature. Because despite what Israel is saying, as it weaponizes this claim of self-defense to carry out its operations in the Gaza Strip, it is incredibly clear that the motivations are genocidal in nature, and that Israel is willingly and actively and enthusiastically committing a genocide in the Gaza Strip. This is not self-defense. This is genocide. Something really we're thinking about as we continue to see this news come in. As always, free Palestine. It'll have a great day.",subjective
