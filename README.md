# CS-315-Final-Project
CS 315 Final Project

Pyktok File
2. cd cs-315-final-project/pyktok
3. python -m venv .project2  (You'll create a new virtual environment to collect data with pyktok)
4. source .project2/bin/source (activate it)
5. pip install -r requirements.txt (will install all packaged you need)

Now you are ready to start collecting data. For you to test, I have included the sample JSON file. But you can use your own JSON file that has the same format.

In the command line:

python3 pyktok-collect.py pyktok_test.json results.csv
