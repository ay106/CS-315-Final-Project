I would recommend that you all read the two reports that were produced by the Ways and Means Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation. For all practical purposes, the research that was done as it relates to the mandatory audit program was non-existent. The tax forms were really never audited and only my sending a letter at one point prompted sort of a rearview mirror response. I emphasize again that the mandatory program has highlighted in what you will likely get in the next few minutes or so. It was almost non-existent. And my point is that that was the legislative purpose with which we won four federal court decisions in three courts. We argued for an examination of how the audit process played out. Once staff went to visit the IRS and once staff had a chance to go to some of the other locations that are within the jurisdiction of the IRS, they quickly concluded that in fact the audit did not occur. There were no audits in a timely manner. That goes I think for 2017, 2018 and 2019. As I noted, we made it through those substantial court decisions. It required patience. Let me say something because I think it appears a personal note. This was never about being punitive. It was never about being malicious. I never over promised. I never built an unreasonable level of expectation. And time it again, I refrained from the questions in the hallway that you posed to me because I was not about to upset a very sensitive court case. The other thing that happened much to your dislike was that there were no leaks that occurred from the committee. We kept this very much above board, went back and forth with the attorneys at the committee. And we were determined to put forward a case that would, as I noted early on when I was asked in the hallway right after my letter originally was sent, I was asked what do you expect? And I said a long and grueling court case. That was my quote three and a half years ago. That's what happened. Did we have enough time to conduct the review? Yes, we did. These were individuals on the tax staff who were seasoned professionals, tax lawyers and accountants. They proceeded as I knew they would with not only great professionalism, but also with great restraint. Not to overdo anything as they undertook their responsibilities. When Republicans argue, and I want to hear from the others here, when Republicans argue that there was no precedent. There is a letter from Richard Nixon on December 13th of 1973 to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Wilbur Mills. And he asked Wilbur Mills to have the joint committee on taxation review as tax returns. It began that very day. This idea that this never happened before, well, 49 years ago, it did happen.",subjective,tax audit

That's not illegal. That's just how taxes work. Even small businesses do it. This is not a new concept. You can investors as the main example, they will sell whatever they invest in, take a major loss in order to pay taxes that are so low that it doesn't hurt them or pay no taxes at all.

And most likely if nobody takes any action, our taxes are going to go up. I'll tell you another thing, when Trump passed the tax bill in 2017, he permanently lowered the corporate tax rate to 21%. And he only temporarily lowered the individual tax rate like 2 or 3%. But hopefully when 2025 comes around and they're discussing some tax reform, hopefully we see some positive, simple tax reform and it permanently lowers tax rates for individuals or possibly increases the child tax credit amongst other things.

And between 2011 and 2021 we know that Trump and his organization knowingly and intentionally created more than 200 false and misleading valuations of assets on his annual statements and cheated banks and the IRS. And despite Trump's countless claims that he was under quote a routine tax on it we discovered that in the first two years of the Trump term the IRS somehow magically stopped investigating him. And the latest news reported just two days ago is that Trump knowingly and repeatedly lied on his federal financial disclosures about a major loan which apparently never existed and may have helped him evade taxes on $48 million in income.

But today, an inflection point, a day that never seemed like it would come. After years of attempting to keep his tax returns private, Donald Trump's returns have been made public, six years of them, from 2015 to 2020, showing that he paid little taxes before and during his presidency, and that he reported no charitable contributions in 2020. The public release of these returns follows a years-long court battle, but the House Ways and Means Committee. Here's committee member Lloyd Dogget, a Democrat from Texas, on what in his view was uncovered. Here is the most powerful man in the world, the self-described clever genius who brags of his wealth almost daily. And he did not pay the taxes that the most modest wage earner in this country would pay. Everything in one year, $750 a year and others, all of this related to the claims for big losses, big deductions, big credits, taking advantage of every loophole.

And most likely if nobody takes any action, our taxes are going to go up. I'll tell you another thing, when Trump passed the tax bill in 2017, he permanently lowered the corporate tax rate to 21%. And he only temporarily lowered the individual tax rate like 2 or 3%. But hopefully when 2025 comes around and they're discussing some tax reform, hopefully we see some positive, simple tax reform and it permanently lowers tax rates for individuals or possibly increases the child tax credit amongst other things. I'll be posting more videos on the changes that are coming after the year 2025 when the TCGA Sunsets, meaning all those tax provisions from 2017 will go away.

And between 2011 and 2021 we know that Trump and his organization knowingly and intentionally created more than 200 false and misleading valuations of assets on his annual statements and cheated banks and the IRS. And despite Trump's countless claims that he was under quote a routine tax on it we discovered that in the first two years of the Trump term the IRS somehow magically stopped investigating him. And the latest news reported just two days ago is that Trump knowingly and repeatedly lied on his federal financial disclosures about a major loan which apparently never existed and may have helped him evade taxes on $48 million in income.

Donald Trump, the businessman turned American president, took pride, reveled in taking full advantage of the government for his own financial gain. That detail from Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, was yet another in a series of revelations about Trump's tax paying habits that have come to light in recent years, including the mammoth piece of reporting, body of reporting by The New York Times, starting in 2020 that exposed Trump's chronic losses in years of tax avoidance. But today, an inflection point, a day that never seemed like it would come. After years of attempting to keep his tax returns private, Donald Trump's returns have been made public, six years of them, from 2015 to 2020, showing that he paid little taxes before and during his presidency, and that he reported no charitable contributions in 2020. The public release of these returns follows a years-long court battle, but the House Ways and Means Committee. Here's committee member Lloyd Dogget, a Democrat from Texas, on what in his view was uncovered. Here is the most powerful man in the world, the self-described clever genius who brags of his wealth almost daily. And he did not pay the taxes that the most modest wage earner in this country would pay. Everything in one year, $750 a year and others, all of this related to the claims for big losses, big deductions, big credits, taking advantage of every loophole. And because of the sorry job that Trump's Internal Revenue Service did, we don't know if how many of these were legal loopholes for the rich and how many of them were unjust and illegal because the IRS didn't do the job of auditing. And I think Americans should be greatly outraged.",subjective,tax evasion

I would recommend that you all read the two reports that were produced by the Ways and Means Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation. For all practical purposes, the research that was done as it relates to the mandatory audit program was non-existent. The tax forms were really never audited and only my sending a letter at one point prompted sort of a rearview mirror response. I emphasize again that the mandatory program has highlighted in what you will likely get in the next few minutes or so. It was almost non-existent. And my point is that that was the legislative purpose with which we won four federal court decisions in three courts. We argued for an examination of how the audit process played out. Once staff went to visit the IRS and once staff had a chance to go to some of the other locations that are within the jurisdiction of the IRS, they quickly concluded that in fact the audit did not occur. There were no audits in a timely manner. That goes I think for 2017, 2018 and 2019. As I noted, we made it through those substantial court decisions. It required patience. Let me say something because I think it appears a personal note. This was never about being punitive. It was never about being malicious. I never over promised. I never built an unreasonable level of expectation. And time it again, I refrained from the questions in the hallway that you posed to me because I was not about to upset a very sensitive court case. The other thing that happened much to your dislike was that there were no leaks that occurred from the committee. We kept this very much above board, went back and forth with the attorneys at the committee. And we were determined to put forward a case that would, as I noted early on when I was asked in the hallway right after my letter originally was sent, I was asked what do you expect? And I said a long and grueling court case. That was my quote three and a half years ago. That's what happened. Did we have enough time to conduct the review? Yes, we did. These were individuals on the tax staff who were seasoned professionals, tax lawyers and accountants. They proceeded as I knew they would with not only great professionalism, but also with great restraint. Not to overdo anything as they undertook their responsibilities. When Republicans argue, and I want to hear from the others here, when Republicans argue that there was no precedent. There is a letter from Richard Nixon on December 13th of 1973 to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Wilbur Mills. And he asked Wilbur Mills to have the joint committee on taxation review as tax returns. It began that very day.

Rooted in a desire to preserve the wisdom of past generations, it champions the continuity of established institutions and customs. At its core, conservatism is marked by a cautious approach to societal changes, preferring evolution over revolution to ensure stability and cohesion within society. Conservatives advocate for a limited government, asserting that minimal state intervention allows for greater personal freedom and economic prosperity. Economic freedom is also a key tenant, with free market principles favored for fostering innovation and growth.

Every single year they conduct their annual values and belief survey. And the latest addition shows that American support for social conservatism is at a decade high. It is increasing among all demographics. According to the poll, 38% of Americans now identify as socially conservative. In comparison to 29% who identify as socially liberal. This is the highest percentage in the poll that have identified as socially conservative since 2012. The poll also showed that the percentage of 18 to 29 year olds, people who largely make up Gen Z, identifying a socially conservative increased by 6 percentage points between 2021 and 2023. And Americans ages 30 to 49 years old shifted socially conservative by 13 points since 2021. It showed that Republicans and Independents all became more conservative in the last two years. While registered Democrats largely stayed the same. It also showed that the percentage of Americans who identify as fiscally conservative is now at 44%. Nearly half of the survey said that they are conservative on economic issues. So what exactly does all of this mean? Well for starters, it means that there is a genuine negative reaction to social leftism in this country. People it turns out don't like the rainbow mafia being shoved down their throats. They think it's wrong for kids to go through sex changes. It's wrong for men to play women's sports. People don't want pornography or LGBT propaganda in their schools. It shows that people in this country still hold traditional values dear. And that all of these are incredibly popular issues for Republicans to lean into. The other thing it shows is that when thing one and thing two here say that Gen Z is going to deliver an overwhelming Democrat victory, that's not really entirely true. Sure, in 2020 and in 2022 the Democrat Party received overwhelming support from Gen Z voters. But this is not necessarily because the Democrat Party has better ideas. It's because they are a lot better than Republicans at driving out younger voters. Something the GOP needs to get their shit together about. In addition, ever since millennials voted overwhelmingly for Barack Obama in 2008, their voting trends have shifted hard to the right. The 2020 election millennial voters backed Joe Biden by a percentage of 55 to 43. This is half of the margins that Obama got 12 years earlier. 2020 exit polls showed that Joe Biden won by just six points among voters who were 18 to 27 in 2008. During the 2022 midterm, those same voters only backed Democrats by 10 points. So no, the Democrat Party does not own younger voters. And they are in fact getting more ideologically conservative. Now all the Republican Party has to do is translate that into electoral success, by running on a positive and inspiring agenda for the country. To work to drive out younger voters in the same way that the Democrat Party does very well. But don't underestimate the GOP's ability to fuck things up.",subjective,social conservatism

So my best resource for you is going to be to check out the DBQ from 2015 at a disease centrally this question. You can totally just check out the DBQ on its own or you can go to the student samples because that includes the rubrics. You're going to get a whole bunch of information there. But generally, what we see happening is that by 1980, Democrats and liberals have had control of governments since 1932. Now, even though there were some Republican presidents in this time period like Nixon and Eisenhower during their Presidencies, oftentimes Democrats still controlled Congress. So Republicans just didn't have a complete control over government. So by 1980, conservatives were like, we need a new block of voters. We need to bring in a group of loyal voters to the Republican Party who will constantly vote for us, which will bring us power. So they start looking at some of these social movements that are happening at the time. So there is basically almost like a third grade awakening. It's not called that. But there's a big evangelical movement that's happening in response to backlash to the counterculture that's happening in the 70s. So they are responding to the drug culture, the hippie culture, the changes in gender roles, the Roe v. Wade court case. And so they're trying to, a lot of evangelicals are emphasizing more traditional values. And they're very apprehensive about social change. So Republicans see this big group of people that care about that and they decide to adopt some of those ideas into the conservative party platform to bring them as voters. And so we see a group called the new right, the religious right, the moral majority, really being brought into the conservative party. And that is going to lead in a large part to the growth of the conservative movement overall. Additionally, there's some economic things that are happening in the 70s. There's an economic crisis and an economic recession, energy crisis, stagflation, inflation. A lot of us going to be blamed on President Carter, who was a Democrat. So that will also contribute to the rise of the conservative party. Again, check out DBQ from 2015. Hope that helps you.",subjective,political history

This division may seem daunting, but at its core, both sides are driven by intentions that aim to shape the nation's path. Conservatism, in its most positive light, acts as a guardian of the nation's cherished values and traditions. It's about safeguarding the principles that have guided generations, ensuring they remain untouched and preserved against the tide of rapid change. Those who lean towards conservatism focus on protection, emphasizing the need to hold onto the aspects of society that have stood the test of time successfully. On the flip side, progressivism thrives on the idea of improvement and evolution. It questions the status quo, asking critical questions about our current practices and seeking ways to address and rectify shortcomings. Progressivism is fueled by the desire to advance society, making it more equitable and just for all its members. It's a force for constructive change, pushing for reforms and innovations that promise a better future. The dynamic between conservatism and progressivism serves as a balancing act. Each ideology keeps the other in check, ensuring that the nation moves forward without losing sight of its foundational values. This balance is crucial in navigating the complexities of governance and societal progression.

This comes from the great replacement theory on the white often promoted by Fox News personality Tucker Carlson, that falsely claims that Jews are orchestrating a sinister plot to replace white people in America with dark skin minorities. How ironic then that this bubbling scandal involves a jealous gay man outing another gay man and his white supremacist friend Nick Frentes so he could return to the posse of a black rapper. So Frentes' buddies are two gay dudes, one with the birth name Ali Akbar and an African-American hip hop star. Guess what Frentes? Your white buddies have been replaced by you. Oddly, your friend circle looks like the group I went to gay pride with last June. You promote enough diversity to satisfy an Ivy League gender studies program. The Daily Beast reports, quote, Alexander who has described as ethnicity as half black and half Arab and says he's bisexual might seem like an unusual ally for the invowedly racist and homophobic America First Movement. You reckon? But the more you think about it, the modern conservative movement is a front and a fraud. It's about deflection and projection. What binds all of these phonies together is a contradictory worship of family values and love of Donald Trump. These family loving religious men support Trump who was just fingerprinted in Manhattan because he botched paying off a porn actress in which he cheated on his wife shortly after she gave birth. Kanye West himself is divorced, a strange from his children and runs a shady, unaccredited school in a Los Angeles suburb called Donda Academy. The school's former principal, Bula McLoyd, told Rolling Stone, quote, as an educator with over 22 years of experience in the field. I always put children at the forefront of any decision I make. Consequently, I moved on. McLoyd's words are symbolic of the entire modern conservative movement. It claims to care about children but often exploits them in every opportunity.

Despite everything that you're hearing in the news, we are witnessing a huge right-word shift in American politics and ideology. And something like this doesn't happen quick. This is something that will take a decade or decades to fully manifest. The root of the matter is that our Supreme Court is more conservative than it's been in 90 years. They have a 6-3 conservative majority. Some of the most notable rulings were the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the severe curtailing of affirmative action. And conservatives have clearly targeted women's rights in order to achieve their aims. Clearly, the overturning of Roe v. Wade is a violation of women's rights. I don't need to explain that to you. But most people think that affirmative action only benefits minorities while it has benefited women tremendously in our history. Let me correct that actually. It's white women. White women have benefited tremendously in affirmative action more than any other minority. Which is pretty crazy because some of the largest arguments against affirmative action have come from white women. And there's something much more in cities going on with the GOP trying to take apart women's rights by pushing the LGBTQ issue. Conservative politicians were never concerned about the LGBTQ community attacking anyone in bathrooms. Since conservatives seem to do that more. Conservatives put up a straw man, attacked that straw man, that LGBTQ community went against those attacks. And now we have the issues that we have. The middle has been clearly spooked by the left. And now they are shifting right. And they are going to vote in a whole bunch of conservative local and state politicians. I don't think Trump will get reelected though. The fact that the three heads of the top universities in the world could not condemn calls for Jewish genocide is the straw that broke the camel's back for a lot of the middle. On this particular issue, any college that supports this kind of mentality will never see a penny of my money. Now I've already mentioned a conservative majority in the Supreme Court. With the district courts we have 91 of them. There is still a majority held by the Democrats. But the federal circuit courts also have a conservative majority. And something like this always happens whenever there's some kind of major event that affects America like COVID. Same thing happened after the Civil War and Reconstruction. We had a huge rightward shift. Same thing happened after the gilded age. But when things got really bad, like the Great Depression and then World War II there was a huge progressive shift. Things got so bad in this country that our leaders were worried about a communist revolution so they actually started implementing policy that favored labor. And that progressive shift lasted until the Civil Rights era. Of course 1980 Ronald Reagan gets elected and boom! A huge conservative shift happens in this country again. And it really doesn't end until the middle of the 2000s. And it's not always a president or congressman getting elected that determines the left or the rightward shift that this country goes through. Generally it's the steering of American law. And right now with the 63 conservative majority in the Supreme Court and everything else that's going on, it does look like it's heading in a rightward direction. And that rightward direction means the erosion of women's rights. I'm not saying women are going to lose their right to vote or even their right to work, but they are going to lose a lot of protections as a result of this. This is also going to affect unions, any other minority, employees, labor in general. Teachers' rights are going to be infringed upon especially with the whole teaching creationism in science class. In my personal opinion, it's a step back for the American people.",subjective,political shift

I think it has merit, I think it has merit in a vast array of circumstances. And it's actually not a bad place to start. The primary idea of conservatism as a political ideology isn't to stop change happening at all. It's to allow change within a society to happen organically, to stop radical change happening, to respect what has worked in the past because that is safe, we know that works. History is listed with examples of where people have tried to fix a society and they've simply broken it. They've made it way, way worse. Like look at any revolution in history you want to look at. French Revolution, Russian Revolution, Chinese Revolution, all ended in terrible bloodshed and things getting worse, not better. So respecting other past and gradual change is a very safe way to engineer society. However, there are areas where conservatism just fails. So such as dealing with systemic racism that's embedded in the past or climate change. It's in these areas where you need progressive ideas to fix them. So really you need a balance.",subjective,political ideology

This kind of tension, rooted in the desire for progress and preservation, is fundamentally healthy. What's often overlooked is the existence of nuanced progressivism and conservatism, which, despite their frequent clashes, manage to work in tandem. Their disagreements are not signs of failure but indicators of a vibrant democratic process. Yet, beneath this sophisticated interplay lies a growing concern. The rise of more primitive-minded factions on both ends of the political spectrum threatens to overshadow the beneficial dialogue between the more enlightened conservatives and progressives. These crude forces, growing in power and influence, are creating an imbalance, shifting the focus away from productive discourse towards something more primal. The real story transcends the simple left-right dichotomy, highlighting a struggle between elevated political thought and its more basic counterparts. This expanding influence of ancient psychological tendencies within modern politics is a phenomenon that's reshaping the landscape, presenting challenges to the harmonious conflict that once moved us forward.

Conservatism is a political philosophy that values tradition, advocates for gradual change and emphasizes the importance of maintaining social order. Rooted in a desire to preserve the wisdom of past generations, it champions the continuity of established institutions and customs. At its core, conservatism is marked by a cautious approach to societal changes, preferring evolution over revolution to ensure stability and cohesion within society. Conservatives advocate for a limited government, asserting that minimal state intervention allows for greater personal freedom and economic prosperity. Economic freedom is also a key tenant, with free market principles favored for fostering innovation and growth.

Every single year they conduct their annual values and belief survey. And the latest addition shows that American support for social conservatism is at a decade high. It is increasing among all demographics. According to the poll, 38% of Americans now identify as socially conservative. In comparison to 29% who identify as socially liberal. This is the highest percentage in the poll that have identified as socially conservative since 2012. The poll also showed that the percentage of 18 to 29 year olds, people who largely make up Gen Z, identifying a socially conservative increased by 6 percentage points between 2021 and 2023. And Americans ages 30 to 49 years old shifted socially conservative by 13 points since 2021. It showed that Republicans and Independents all became more conservative in the last two years. While registered Democrats largely stayed the same. It also showed that the percentage of Americans who identify as fiscally conservative is now at 44%. Nearly half of the survey said that they are conservative on economic issues. So what exactly does all of this mean? Well for starters, it means that there is a genuine negative reaction to social leftism in this country. People it turns out don't like the rainbow mafia being shoved down their throats. They think it's wrong for kids to go through sex changes. It's wrong for men to play women's sports. People don't want pornography or LGBT propaganda in their schools. It shows that people in this country still hold traditional values dear. And that all of these are incredibly popular issues for Republicans to lean into. The other thing it shows is that when thing one and thing two here say that Gen Z is going to deliver an overwhelming Democrat victory, that's not really entirely true. Sure, in 2020 and in 2022 the Democrat Party received overwhelming support from Gen Z voters. But this is not necessarily because the Democrat Party has better ideas. It's because they are a lot better than Republicans at driving out younger voters. Something the GOP needs to get their shit together about. In addition, ever since millennials voted overwhelmingly for Barack Obama in 2008, their voting trends have shifted hard to the right. The 2020 election millennial voters backed Joe Biden by a percentage of 55 to 43. This is half of the margins that Obama got 12 years earlier. 2020 exit polls showed that Joe Biden won by just six points among voters who were 18 to 27 in 2008. During the 2022 midterm, those same voters only backed Democrats by 10 points. So no, the Democrat Party does not own younger voters. And they are in fact getting more ideologically conservative. Now all the Republican Party has to do is translate that into electoral success, by running on a positive and inspiring agenda for the country. To work to drive out younger voters in the same way that the Democrat Party does very well. But don't underestimate the GOP's ability to fuck things up.",subjective,social conservatism

So my best resource for you is going to be to check out the DBQ from 2015 at a disease centrally this question. You can totally just check out the DBQ on its own or you can go to the student samples because that includes the rubrics. You're going to get a whole bunch of information there. But generally, what we see happening is that by 1980, Democrats and liberals have had control of governments since 1932. Now, even though there were some Republican presidents in this time period like Nixon and Eisenhower during their Presidencies, oftentimes Democrats still controlled Congress. So Republicans just didn't have a complete control over government. So by 1980, conservatives were like, we need a new block of voters. We need to bring in a group of loyal voters to the Republican Party who will constantly vote for us, which will bring us power. So they start looking at some of these social movements that are happening at the time. So there is basically almost like a third grade awakening. It's not called that. But there's a big evangelical movement that's happening in response to backlash to the counterculture that's happening in the 70s. So they are responding to the drug culture, the hippie culture, the changes in gender roles, the Roe v. Wade court case. And so they're trying to, a lot of evangelicals are emphasizing more traditional values. And they're very apprehensive about social change. So Republicans see this big group of people that care about that and they decide to adopt some of those ideas into the conservative party platform to bring them as voters. And so we see a group called the new right, the religious right, the moral majority, really being brought into the conservative party. And that is going to lead in a large part to the growth of the conservative movement overall. Additionally, there's some economic things that are happening in the 70s. There's an economic crisis and an economic recession, energy crisis, stagflation, inflation. A lot of us going to be blamed on President Carter, who was a Democrat. So that will also contribute to the rise of the conservative party. Again, check out DBQ from 2015. Hope that helps you.",subjective,political shift

It's about safeguarding the principles that have guided generations, ensuring they remain untouched and preserved against the tide of rapid change. Those who lean towards conservatism focus on protection, emphasizing the need to hold onto the aspects of society that have stood the test of time successfully. On the flip side, progressivism thrives on the idea of improvement and evolution. It questions the status quo, asking critical questions about our current practices and seeking ways to address and rectify shortcomings. Progressivism is fueled by the desire to advance society, making it more equitable and just for all its members. It's a force for constructive change, pushing for reforms and innovations that promise a better future. The dynamic between conservatism and progressivism serves as a balancing act. Each ideology keeps the other in check, ensuring that the nation moves forward without losing sight of its foundational values.

I think it has merit, I think it has merit in a vast array of circumstances. And it's actually not a bad place to start. The primary idea of conservatism as a political ideology isn't to stop change happening at all. It's to allow change within a society to happen organically, to stop radical change happening, to respect what has worked in the past because that is safe, we know that works. History is listed with examples of where people have tried to fix a society and they've simply broken it. They've made it way, way worse. Like look at any revolution in history you want to look at. French Revolution, Russian Revolution, Chinese Revolution, all ended in terrible bloodshed and things getting worse, not better. So respecting other past and gradual change is a very safe way to engineer society. However, there are areas where conservatism just fails. So such as dealing with systemic racism that's embedded in the past or climate change. It's in these areas where you need progressive ideas to fix them.

Conservatism is a political philosophy that values tradition, advocates for gradual change and emphasizes the importance of maintaining social order. Rooted in a desire to preserve the wisdom of past generations, it champions the continuity of established institutions and customs. At its core, conservatism is marked by a cautious approach to societal changes, preferring evolution over revolution to ensure stability and cohesion within society. Conservatives advocate for a limited government, asserting that minimal state intervention allows for greater personal freedom and economic prosperity. Economic freedom is also a key tenant, with free market principles favored for fostering innovation and growth.

Every single year they conduct their annual values and belief survey. And the latest addition shows that American support for social conservatism is at a decade high. It is increasing among all demographics. According to the poll, 38% of Americans now identify as socially conservative. In comparison to 29% who identify as socially liberal. This is the highest percentage in the poll that have identified as socially conservative since 2012. The poll also showed that the percentage of 18 to 29 year olds, people who largely make up Gen Z, identifying a socially conservative increased by 6 percentage points between 2021 and 2023. And Americans ages 30 to 49 years old shifted socially conservative by 13 points since 2021. It showed that Republicans and Independents all became more conservative in the last two years. While registered Democrats largely stayed the same. It also showed that the percentage of Americans who identify as fiscally conservative is now at 44%. Nearly half of the survey said that they are conservative on economic issues. So what exactly does all of this mean? Well for starters, it means that there is a genuine negative reaction to social leftism in this country. People it turns out don't like the rainbow mafia being shoved down their throats. They think it's wrong for kids to go through sex changes. It's wrong for men to play women's sports. People don't want pornography or LGBT propaganda in their schools. It shows that people in this country still hold traditional values dear. And that all of these are incredibly popular issues for Republicans to lean into. The other thing it shows is that when thing one and thing two here say that Gen Z is going to deliver an overwhelming Democrat victory, that's not really entirely true. Sure, in 2020 and in 2022 the Democrat Party received overwhelming support from Gen Z voters. But this is not necessarily because the Democrat Party has better ideas. It's because they are a lot better than Republicans at driving out younger voters. Something the GOP needs to get their shit together about. In addition, ever since millennials voted overwhelmingly for Barack Obama in 2008, their voting trends have shifted hard to the right. The 2020 election millennial voters backed Joe Biden by a percentage of 55 to 43. This is half of the margins that Obama got 12 years earlier. 2020 exit polls showed that Joe Biden won by just six points among voters who were 18 to 27 in 2008. During the 2022 midterm, those same voters only backed Democrats by 10 points. So no, the Democrat Party does not own younger voters. And they are in fact getting more ideologically conservative. Now all the Republican Party has to do is translate that into electoral success, by running on a positive and inspiring agenda for the country. To work to drive out younger voters in the same way that the Democrat Party does very well. But don't underestimate the GOP's ability to fuck things up.",subjective,social conservatism

So my best resource for you is going to be to check out the DBQ from 2015 at a disease centrally this question. You can totally just check out the DBQ on its own or you can go to the student samples because that includes the rubrics. You're going to get a whole bunch of information there. But generally, what we see happening is that by 1980, Democrats and liberals have had control of governments since 1932. Now, even though there were some Republican presidents in this time period like Nixon and Eisenhower during their Presidencies, oftentimes Democrats still controlled Congress. So Republicans just didn't have a complete control over government. So by 1980, conservatives were like, we need a new block of voters. We need to bring in a group of loyal voters to the Republican Party who will constantly vote for us, which will bring us power. So they start looking at some of these social movements that are happening at the time. So there is basically almost like a third grade awakening. It's not called that. But there's a big evangelical movement that's happening in response to backlash to the counterculture that's happening in the 70s. So they are responding to the drug culture, the hippie culture, the changes in gender roles, the Roe v. Wade court case. And so they're trying to, a lot of evangelicals are emphasizing more traditional values. And they're very apprehensive about social change. So Republicans see this big group of people that care about that and they decide to adopt some of those ideas into the conservative party platform to bring them as voters. And so we see a group called the new right, the religious right, the moral majority, really being brought into the conservative party. And that is going to lead in a large part to the growth of the conservative movement overall. Additionally, there's some economic things that are happening in the 70s. There's an economic crisis and an economic recession, energy crisis, stagflation, inflation. A lot of us going to be blamed on President Carter, who was a Democrat. So that will also contribute to the rise of the conservative party. Again, check out DBQ from 2015. Hope that helps you.",subjective,political shift

This division may seem daunting, but at its core, both sides are driven by intentions that aim to shape the nation's path. Conservatism, in its most positive light, acts as a guardian of the nation's cherished values and traditions. It's about safeguarding the principles that have guided generations, ensuring they remain untouched and preserved against the tide of rapid change. Those who lean towards conservatism focus on protection, emphasizing the need to hold onto the aspects of society that have stood the test of time successfully. On the flip side, progressivism thrives on the idea of improvement and evolution. It questions the status quo, asking critical questions about our current practices and seeking ways to address and rectify shortcomings. Progressivism is fueled by the desire to advance society, making it more equitable and just for all its members. It's a force for constructive change, pushing for reforms and innovations that promise a better future. The dynamic between conservatism and progressivism serves as a balancing act. Each ideology keeps the other in check, ensuring that the nation moves forward without losing sight of its foundational values. This balance is crucial in navigating the complexities of governance and societal progression.

He has admitted to soliciting and exchanging nude pics online with un-aged boys. One boy was 17, the other 15. In a statement acknowledging his guilt, Alexander wrote, quote, this is too gay, adding that he was battling with SSA or same-sex attraction. This unscientific phrase is a fundamentalist Christian conversion therapy term, meaning I feel guilty for lusting after boys. A right-wing conservative quote grew while accusing others of gruelling is hardly news. It comes with a territory. After all, modern conservatism is in a movement. It's a mask that covers gruelling, grifting, and guilt. Just ask Matt Schlapp, who runs CPAC, and recently had a gay fondling scandal of his own. While right wingers attack drag queens, their false piety is a form of conservative drag, where they play dress up to conceal their naughty and nefarious true nature. But here is where it gets interesting. Alexander was outed by gay right wing extremist Milo Yanapolis, who himself was canceled in 2017, following remarks he had made that appeared to endorse or at least downplay Pellia. Milo is lashing out now because he found himself on the outside of Kanye West's inner circle. Milo is jealous of Alexander and white supremacist Nick Frentes, who are still in with Kanye. Alexander is a close friend of Frentes, with Frentes accused of helping to cover up Alexander's predatory sexual behavior. Frentes and Alexander are both deeply involved in Donald Trump's America First Movement. Additionally, Frentes marched in the infamous white power rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. At the Snittarius march, Frentes and his fellow white power pals chanted, you will not replace us. This comes from the great replacement theory on the white often promoted by Fox News personality Tucker Carlson, that falsely claims that Jews are orchestrating a sinister plot to replace white people in America with dark skin minorities. How ironic then that this bubbling scandal involves a jealous gay man outing another gay man and his white supremacist friend Nick Frentes so he could return to the posse of a black rapper. So Frentes' buddies are two gay dudes, one with the birth name Ali Akbar and an African-American hip hop star. Guess what Frentes? Your white buddies have been replaced by you. Oddly, your friend circle looks like the group I went to gay pride with last June. You promote enough diversity to satisfy an Ivy League gender studies program. The Daily Beast reports, quote, Alexander who has described as ethnicity as half black and half Arab and says he's bisexual might seem like an unusual ally for the invowedly racist and homophobic America First Movement. You reckon? But the more you think about it, the modern conservative movement is a front and a fraud. It's about deflection and projection. What binds all of these phonies together is a contradictory worship of family values and love of Donald Trump. These family loving religious men support Trump who was just fingerprinted in Manhattan because he botched paying off a porn actress in which he cheated on his wife shortly after she gave birth. Kanye West himself is divorced, a strange from his children and runs a shady, unaccredited school in a Los Angeles suburb called Donda Academy. The school's former principal, Bula McLoyd, told Rolling Stone, quote, as an educator with over 22 years of experience in the field. I always put children at the forefront of any decision I make. Consequently, I moved on. McLoyd's words are symbolic of the entire modern conservative movement. It claims to care about children but often exploits them in every opportunity.

Despite everything that you're hearing in the news, we are witnessing a huge right-word shift in American politics and ideology. And something like this doesn't happen quick. This is something that will take a decade or decades to fully manifest. The root of the matter is that our Supreme Court is more conservative than it's been in 90 years. They have a 6-3 conservative majority. Some of the most notable rulings were the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the severe curtailing of affirmative action. And conservatives have clearly targeted women's rights in order to achieve their aims. Clearly, the overturning of Roe v. Wade is a violation of women's rights. I don't need to explain that to you. But most people think that affirmative action only benefits minorities while it has benefited women tremendously in our history. Let me correct that actually. It's white women. White women have benefited tremendously in affirmative action more than any other minority. Which is pretty crazy because some of the largest arguments against affirmative action have come from white women. And there's something much more in cities going on with the GOP trying to take apart women's rights by pushing the LGBTQ issue. Conservative politicians were never concerned about the LGBTQ community attacking anyone in bathrooms. Since conservatives seem to do that more. Conservatives put up a straw man, attacked that straw man, that LGBTQ community went against those attacks. And now we have the issues that we have. The middle has been clearly spooked by the left. And now they are shifting right. And they are going to vote in a whole bunch of conservative local and state politicians. I don't think Trump will get reelected though. The fact that the three heads of the top universities in the world could not condemn calls for Jewish genocide is the straw that broke the camel's back for a lot of the middle. On this particular issue, any college that supports this kind of mentality will never see a penny of my money. Now I've already mentioned a conservative majority in the Supreme Court. With the district courts we have 91 of them. There is still a majority held by the Democrats. But the federal circuit courts also have a conservative majority. And something like this always happens whenever there's some kind of major event that affects America like COVID. Same thing happened after the Civil War and Reconstruction. We had a huge rightward shift. Same thing happened after the gilded age. But when things got really bad, like the Great Depression and then World War II there was a huge progressive shift. Things got so bad in this country that our leaders were worried about a communist revolution so they actually started implementing policy that favored labor. And that progressive shift lasted until the Civil Rights era. Of course 1980 Ronald Reagan gets elected and boom! A huge conservative shift happens in this country again. And it really doesn't end until the middle of the 2000s. And it's not always a president or congressman getting elected that determines the left or the rightward shift that this country goes through. Generally it's the steering of American law. And right now with the 63 conservative majority in the Supreme Court and everything else that's going on, it does look like it's heading in a rightward direction. And that rightward direction means the erosion of women's rights. I'm not saying women are going to lose their right to vote or even their right to work, but they are going to lose a lot of protections as a result of this. This is also going to affect unions, any other minority, employees, labor in general. Teachers' rights are going to be infringed upon especially with the whole teaching creationism in science class. In my personal opinion, it's a step back for the American people.",subjective,political shift

The real story transcends the simple left-right dichotomy, highlighting a struggle between elevated political thought and its more basic counterparts. This expanding influence of ancient psychological tendencies within modern politics is a phenomenon that's reshaping the landscape, presenting challenges to the harmonious conflict that once moved us forward. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for navigating the complexities of contemporary political discourse. The emergence of this ancient psychology within the political realm is a pressing issue, potentially altering the very fabric of political engagement and decision-making. It begs the question of how we can foster an environment where the more refined forms of political thought can flourish, free from the intimidation and dominance of their primitive-minded versions.  #uspolitics #politicaldiscourse #progressivism #conservatism #politicaldynamics ",False,,mindvalley.daily,Mindvalley Daily,,,,,,False,Conservatism (US Politics),2021,@mindvalley.daily_video_7357386605427969322.txt," The problem in the US is that within the left and right, you have the wiser parts of the left and wiser parts of the right.

Every single year they conduct their annual values and belief survey. And the latest addition shows that American support for social conservatism is at a decade high. It is increasing among all demographics. According to the poll, 38% of Americans now identify as socially conservative. In comparison to 29% who identify as socially liberal. This is the highest percentage in the poll that have identified as socially conservative since 2012. The poll also showed that the percentage of 18 to 29 year olds, people who largely make up Gen Z, identifying a socially conservative increased by 6 percentage points between 2021 and 2023. And Americans ages 30 to 49 years old shifted socially conservative by 13 points since 2021. It showed that Republicans and Independents all became more conservative in the last two years. While registered Democrats largely stayed the same. It also showed that the percentage of Americans who identify as fiscally conservative is now at 44%. Nearly half of the survey said that they are conservative on economic issues. So what exactly does all of this mean? Well for starters, it means that there is a genuine negative reaction to social leftism in this country. People it turns out don't like the rainbow mafia being shoved down their throats. They think it's wrong for kids to go through sex changes. It's wrong for men to play women's sports. People don't want pornography or LGBT propaganda in their schools. It shows that people in this country still hold traditional values dear. And that all of these are incredibly popular issues for Republicans to lean into. The other thing it shows is that when thing one and thing two here say that Gen Z is going to deliver an overwhelming Democrat victory, that's not really entirely true. Sure, in 2020 and in 2022 the Democrat Party received overwhelming support from Gen Z voters. But this is not necessarily because the Democrat Party has better ideas. It's because they are a lot better than Republicans at driving out younger voters. Something the GOP needs to get their shit together about. In addition, ever since millennials voted overwhelmingly for Barack Obama in 2008, their voting trends have shifted hard to the right. The 2020 election millennial voters backed Joe Biden by a percentage of 55 to 43. This is half of the margins that Obama got 12 years earlier. 2020 exit polls showed that Joe Biden won by just six points among voters who were 18 to 27 in 2008. During the 2022 midterm, those same voters only backed Democrats by 10 points. So no, the Democrat Party does not own younger voters. And they are in fact getting more ideologically conservative. Now all the Republican Party has to do is translate that into electoral success, by running on a positive and inspiring agenda for the country. To work to drive out younger voters in the same way that the Democrat Party does very well. But don't underestimate the GOP's ability to fuck things up.",subjective,social conservatism

So my best resource for you is going to be to check out the DBQ from 2015 at a disease centrally this question. You can totally just check out the DBQ on its own or you can go to the student samples because that includes the rubrics. You're going to get a whole bunch of information there. But generally, what we see happening is that by 1980, Democrats and liberals have had control of governments since 1932. Now, even though there were some Republican presidents in this time period like Nixon and Eisenhower during their Presidencies, oftentimes Democrats still controlled Congress. So Republicans just didn't have a complete control over government. So by 1980, conservatives were like, we need a new block of voters. We need to bring in a group of loyal voters to the Republican Party who will constantly vote for us, which will bring us power. So they start looking at some of these social movements that are happening at the time. So there is basically almost like a third grade awakening. It's not called that. But there's a big evangelical movement that's happening in response to backlash to the counterculture that's happening in the 70s. So they are responding to the drug culture, the hippie culture, the changes in gender roles, the Roe v. Wade court case. And so they're trying to, a lot of evangelicals are emphasizing more traditional values. And they're very apprehensive about social change. So Republicans see this big group of people that care about that and they decide to adopt some of those ideas into the conservative party platform to bring them as voters. And so we see a group called the new right, the religious right, the moral majority, really being brought into the conservative party. And that is going to lead in a large part to the growth of the conservative movement overall. Additionally, there's some economic things that are happening in the 70s. There's an economic crisis and an economic recession, energy crisis, stagflation, inflation. A lot of us going to be blamed on President Carter, who was a Democrat. So that will also contribute to the rise of the conservative party. Again, check out DBQ from 2015. Hope that helps you.",subjective,political shift

This division may seem daunting, but at its core, both sides are driven by intentions that aim to shape the nation's path. Conservatism, in its most positive light, acts as a guardian of the nation's cherished values and traditions. It's about safeguarding the principles that have guided generations, ensuring they remain untouched and preserved against the tide of rapid change. Those who lean towards conservatism focus on protection, emphasizing the need to hold onto the aspects of society that have stood the test of time successfully. On the flip side, progressivism thrives on the idea of improvement and evolution. It questions the status quo, asking critical questions about our current practices and seeking ways to address and rectify shortcomings. Progressivism is fueled by the desire to advance society, making it more equitable and just for all its members. It's a force for constructive change, pushing for reforms and innovations that promise a better future. The dynamic between conservatism and progressivism serves as a balancing act. Each ideology keeps the other in check, ensuring that the nation moves forward without losing sight of its foundational values. This balance is crucial in navigating the complexities of governance and societal progression. Understanding the intrinsic values and goals of both conservatism and progressivism can foster a more empathetic and productive political discourse.

He has admitted to soliciting and exchanging nude pics online with un-aged boys. One boy was 17, the other 15. In a statement acknowledging his guilt, Alexander wrote, quote, this is too gay, adding that he was battling with SSA or same-sex attraction. This unscientific phrase is a fundamentalist Christian conversion therapy term, meaning I feel guilty for lusting after boys. A right-wing conservative quote grew while accusing others of gruelling is hardly news. It comes with a territory. After all, modern conservatism is in a movement. It's a mask that covers gruelling, grifting, and guilt. Just ask Matt Schlapp, who runs CPAC, and recently had a gay fondling scandal of his own. While right wingers attack drag queens, their false piety is a form of conservative drag, where they play dress up to conceal their naughty and nefarious true nature. But here is where it gets interesting. Alexander was outed by gay right wing extremist Milo Yanapolis, who himself was canceled in 2017, following remarks he had made that appeared to endorse or at least downplay Pellia. Milo is lashing out now because he found himself on the outside of Kanye West's inner circle. Milo is jealous of Alexander and white supremacist Nick Frentes, who are still in with Kanye. Alexander is a close friend of Frentes, with Frentes accused of helping to cover up Alexander's predatory sexual behavior. Frentes and Alexander are both deeply involved in Donald Trump's America First Movement. Additionally, Frentes marched in the infamous white power rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. At the Snittarius march, Frentes and his fellow white power pals chanted, you will not replace us. This comes from the great replacement theory on the white often promoted by Fox News personality Tucker Carlson, that falsely claims that Jews are orchestrating a sinister plot to replace white people in America with dark skin minorities. How ironic then that this bubbling scandal involves a jealous gay man outing another gay man and his white supremacist friend Nick Frentes so he could return to the posse of a black rapper. So Frentes' buddies are two gay dudes, one with the birth name Ali Akbar and an African-American hip hop star. Guess what Frentes? Your white buddies have been replaced by you. Oddly, your friend circle looks like the group I went to gay pride with last June. You promote enough diversity to satisfy an Ivy League gender studies program. The Daily Beast reports, quote, Alexander who has described as ethnicity as half black and half Arab and says he's bisexual might seem like an unusual ally for the invowedly racist and homophobic America First Movement. You reckon? But the more you think about it, the modern conservative movement is a front and a fraud. It's about deflection and projection. What binds all of these phonies together is a contradictory worship of family values and love of Donald Trump. These family loving religious men support Trump who was just fingerprinted in Manhattan because he botched paying off a porn actress in which he cheated on his wife shortly after she gave birth. Kanye West himself is divorced, a strange from his children and runs a shady, unaccredited school in a Los Angeles suburb called Donda Academy. The school's former principal, Bula McLoyd, told Rolling Stone, quote, as an educator with over 22 years of experience in the field. I always put children at the forefront of any decision I make. Consequently, I moved on. McLoyd's words are symbolic of the entire modern conservative movement. It claims to care about children but often exploits them in every opportunity.

Despite everything that you're hearing in the news, we are witnessing a huge right-word shift in American politics and ideology. And something like this doesn't happen quick. This is something that will take a decade or decades to fully manifest. The root of the matter is that our Supreme Court is more conservative than it's been in 90 years. They have a 6-3 conservative majority. Some of the most notable rulings were the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the severe curtailing of affirmative action. And conservatives have clearly targeted women's rights in order to achieve their aims. Clearly, the overturning of Roe v. Wade is a violation of women's rights. I don't need to explain that to you. But most people think that affirmative action only benefits minorities while it has benefited women tremendously in our history. Let me correct that actually. It's white women. White women have benefited tremendously in affirmative action more than any other minority. Which is pretty crazy because some of the largest arguments against affirmative action have come from white women. And there's something much more in cities going on with the GOP trying to take apart women's rights by pushing the LGBTQ issue. Conservative politicians were never concerned about the LGBTQ community attacking anyone in bathrooms. Since conservatives seem to do that more. Conservatives put up a straw man, attacked that straw man, that LGBTQ community went against those attacks. And now we have the issues that we have. The middle has been clearly spooked by the left. And now they are shifting right. And they are going to vote in a whole bunch of conservative local and state politicians. I don't think Trump will get reelected though. The fact that the three heads of the top universities in the world could not condemn calls for Jewish genocide is the straw that broke the camel's back for a lot of the middle. On this particular issue, any college that supports this kind of mentality will never see a penny of my money. Now I've already mentioned a conservative majority in the Supreme Court. With the district courts we have 91 of them. There is still a majority held by the Democrats. But the federal circuit courts also have a conservative majority. And something like this always happens whenever there's some kind of major event that affects America like COVID. Same thing happened after the Civil War and Reconstruction. We had a huge rightward shift. Same thing happened after the gilded age. But when things got really bad, like the Great Depression and then World War II there was a huge progressive shift. Things got so bad in this country that our leaders were worried about a communist revolution so they actually started implementing policy that favored labor. And that progressive shift lasted until the Civil Rights era. Of course 1980 Ronald Reagan gets elected and boom! A huge conservative shift happens in this country again. And it really doesn't end until the middle of the 2000s. And it's not always a president or congressman getting elected that determines the left or the rightward shift that this country goes through. Generally it's the steering of American law. And right now with the 63 conservative majority in the Supreme Court and everything else that's going on, it does look like it's heading in a rightward direction. And that rightward direction means the erosion of women's rights. I'm not saying women are going to lose their right to vote or even their right to work, but they are going to lose a lot of protections as a result of this. This is also going to affect unions, any other minority, employees, labor in general. Teachers' rights are going to be infringed upon especially with the whole teaching creationism in science class. In my personal opinion, it's a step back for the American people.",subjective,political shift

I think it has merit, I think it has merit in a vast array of circumstances. And it's actually not a bad place to start. The primary idea of conservatism as a political ideology isn't to stop change happening at all. It's to allow change within a society to happen organically, to stop radical change happening, to respect what has worked in the past because that is safe, we know that works. History is listed with examples of where people have tried to fix a society and they've simply broken it. They've made it way, way worse. Like look at any revolution in history you want to look at. French Revolution, Russian Revolution, Chinese Revolution, all ended in terrible bloodshed and things getting worse, not better. So respecting other past and gradual change is a very safe way to engineer society. However, there are areas where conservatism just fails. So such as dealing with systemic racism that's embedded in the past or climate change. It's in these areas where you need progressive ideas to fix them.

Sure, in 2020 and in 2022 the Democrat Party received overwhelming support from Gen Z voters. But this is not necessarily because the Democrat Party has better ideas. It's because they are a lot better than Republicans at driving out younger voters. Something the GOP needs to get their shit together about. In addition, ever since millennials voted overwhelmingly for Barack Obama in 2008, their voting trends have shifted hard to the right. The 2020 election millennial voters backed Joe Biden by a percentage of 55 to 43. This is half of the margins that Obama got 12 years earlier. 2020 exit polls showed that Joe Biden won by just six points among voters who were 18 to 27 in 2008. During the 2022 midterm, those same voters only backed Democrats by 10 points. So no, the Democrat Party does not own younger voters. And they are in fact getting more ideologically conservative. Now all the Republican Party has to do is translate that into electoral success, by running on a positive and inspiring agenda for the country. To work to drive out younger voters in the same way that the Democrat Party does very well. But don't underestimate the GOP's ability to fuck things up.",subjective,social conservatism

So my best resource for you is going to be to check out the DBQ from 2015 at a disease centrally this question. You can totally just check out the DBQ on its own or you can go to the student samples because that includes the rubrics. You're going to get a whole bunch of information there. But generally, what we see happening is that by 1980, Democrats and liberals have had control of governments since 1932. Now, even though there were some Republican presidents in this time period like Nixon and Eisenhower during their Presidencies, oftentimes Democrats still controlled Congress. So Republicans just didn't have a complete control over government. So by 1980, conservatives were like, we need a new block of voters. We need to bring in a group of loyal voters to the Republican Party who will constantly vote for us, which will bring us power. So they start looking at some of these social movements that are happening at the time. So there is basically almost like a third grade awakening. It's not called that. But there's a big evangelical movement that's happening in response to backlash to the counterculture that's happening in the 70s. So they are responding to the drug culture, the hippie culture, the changes in gender roles, the Roe v. Wade court case. And so they're trying to, a lot of evangelicals are emphasizing more traditional values. And they're very apprehensive about social change. So Republicans see this big group of people that care about that and they decide to adopt some of those ideas into the conservative party platform to bring them as voters. And so we see a group called the new right, the religious right, the moral majority, really being brought into the conservative party. And that is going to lead in a large part to the growth of the conservative movement overall. Additionally, there's some economic things that are happening in the 70s. There's an economic crisis and an economic recession, energy crisis, stagflation, inflation. A lot of us going to be blamed on President Carter, who was a Democrat. So that will also contribute to the rise of the conservative party. Again, check out DBQ from 2015. Hope that helps you.",subjective,political shift

This division may seem daunting, but at its core, both sides are driven by intentions that aim to shape the nation's path. Conservatism, in its most positive light, acts as a guardian of the nation's cherished values and traditions. It's about safeguarding the principles that have guided generations, ensuring they remain untouched and preserved against the tide of rapid change. Those who lean towards conservatism focus on protection, emphasizing the need to hold onto the aspects of society that have stood the test of time successfully. On the flip side, progressivism thrives on the idea of improvement and evolution. It questions the status quo, asking critical questions about our current practices and seeking ways to address and rectify shortcomings. Progressivism is fueled by the desire to advance society, making it more equitable and just for all its members. It's a force for constructive change, pushing for reforms and innovations that promise a better future. The dynamic between conservatism and progressivism serves as a balancing act. Each ideology keeps the other in check, ensuring that the nation moves forward without losing sight of its foundational values. This balance is crucial in navigating the complexities of governance and societal progression. Understanding the intrinsic values and goals of both conservatism and progressivism can foster a more empathetic and productive political discourse. Recognizing that both camps are ultimately striving for what they believe is best for the country can be the first step towards bridging divides and working collectively towards common goals.  #politics #conservatism #progressivism #uspolitics #politicalbalance ",False,,mindvalley.daily,Mindvalley Daily,,,,,,False,Conservatism (US Politics),2021,@mindvalley.daily_video_7357385132883332394.txt," And the US has kind of split into two different giants, the left giant and the right giant.

He has admitted to soliciting and exchanging nude pics online with un-aged boys. One boy was 17, the other 15. In a statement acknowledging his guilt, Alexander wrote, quote, this is too gay, adding that he was battling with SSA or same-sex attraction. This unscientific phrase is a fundamentalist Christian conversion therapy term, meaning I feel guilty for lusting after boys. A right-wing conservative quote grew while accusing others of gruelling is hardly news. It comes with a territory. After all, modern conservatism is in a movement. It's a mask that covers gruelling, grifting, and guilt. Just ask Matt Schlapp, who runs CPAC, and recently had a gay fondling scandal of his own. While right wingers attack drag queens, their false piety is a form of conservative drag, where they play dress up to conceal their naughty and nefarious true nature. But here is where it gets interesting. Alexander was outed by gay right wing extremist Milo Yanapolis, who himself was canceled in 2017, following remarks he had made that appeared to endorse or at least downplay Pellia. Milo is lashing out now because he found himself on the outside of Kanye West's inner circle. Milo is jealous of Alexander and white supremacist Nick Frentes, who are still in with Kanye. Alexander is a close friend of Frentes, with Frentes accused of helping to cover up Alexander's predatory sexual behavior. Frentes and Alexander are both deeply involved in Donald Trump's America First Movement. Additionally, Frentes marched in the infamous white power rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. At the Snittarius march, Frentes and his fellow white power pals chanted, you will not replace us. This comes from the great replacement theory on the white often promoted by Fox News personality Tucker Carlson, that falsely claims that Jews are orchestrating a sinister plot to replace white people in America with dark skin minorities. How ironic then that this bubbling scandal involves a jealous gay man outing another gay man and his white supremacist friend Nick Frentes so he could return to the posse of a black rapper. So Frentes' buddies are two gay dudes, one with the birth name Ali Akbar and an African-American hip hop star. Guess what Frentes? Your white buddies have been replaced by you. Oddly, your friend circle looks like the group I went to gay pride with last June. You promote enough diversity to satisfy an Ivy League gender studies program. The Daily Beast reports, quote, Alexander who has described as ethnicity as half black and half Arab and says he's bisexual might seem like an unusual ally for the invowedly racist and homophobic America First Movement. You reckon? But the more you think about it, the modern conservative movement is a front and a fraud. It's about deflection and projection. What binds all of these phonies together is a contradictory worship of family values and love of Donald Trump. These family loving religious men support Trump who was just fingerprinted in Manhattan because he botched paying off a porn actress in which he cheated on his wife shortly after she gave birth. Kanye West himself is divorced, a strange from his children and runs a shady, unaccredited school in a Los Angeles suburb called Donda Academy. The school's former principal, Bula McLoyd, told Rolling Stone, quote, as an educator with over 22 years of experience in the field. I always put children at the forefront of any decision I make. Consequently, I moved on. McLoyd's words are symbolic of the entire modern conservative movement. It claims to care about children but often exploits them in every opportunity. It's full of cranks, creeps and cons that publicly profess moral purity while living putrid personal lives.",subjective,conservative

So what was the formula that you found work best? Well, when I first started all this, I had been consuming radical content on YouTube for about six months after the Orlando shooting. I remember I typed that theme into YouTube and was inundated with YouTube videos from Rebel Media and one American News Network type channels. I ended up going down that rabbit hole. I ended up becoming a correspondent for Rebel Media of which I obtained millions of views. And my boss always told me, and the bosses of these other organizations always told me that we should never let the truth get in the way of a good story. And if we can get people angry, and if we can get people upset, we can make more money, we can make more profit, and we can drive the algorithms to keep pushing these videos. It's what made me feel very disenfranchised and I end up speaking out of it all at the end. But as someone who really believed in it and believed that free speech was under attack and that the West was being invaded and all these ideas that they were pushing, I really felt that if I had to take part in disinformation and take part in bending the truth, then it was for the greater good. But actually my boss is, and the people at the top of the Zico system, from Newsmax and all these organizations from Project Veritas, which collaborated with Breville at the time, it was all fair again, because the left were just so terrible. But actually the kind of tactics that they were engaged in, and even myself now looking back were engaged in, were far worse than the, quote unquote, liberal media and CNN, and any of these groups ever took part in. It was completely devoid of any realism or any journalism. We would go to quote unquote, no go zones in 2018 when Fox News would hype up that whole situation. And we would create conflict and then selectively edit it to look like those areas were far more dangerous than they were. Those videos would obtain millions and millions of views. Again, I regret that massively. The only reason I did it was because I was radicalized by those people and felt like it was for the greater good and it was a bit of a cult. But those people profited massively from it and it was always about pushing disinformation. Alex Jones, who I spent a lot of intimate time with and a lot of the people that employed me told me openly that they thought the whole pizza gate staff and the pizza file staff and all the stuff that they were pushing is something that they don't really care about, I already believe in.

What they are correctly pointing out is that a lot of fitness influencers and people in the fitness space are right-wing, anti-vaxx, transphobic, QAnon conspiracy theorists. There is nothing all right about just exercising. But a lot of people who exercise are all right. That's the problem. And what people are pointing out on the left is that these people are like creating a pipeline for young boys who are just interested in bettering themselves to become all right, misogynistic extremists.

So what was the formula that you found work best? Well, when I first started all this, I had been consuming radical content on YouTube for about six months after the Orlando shooting. I remember I typed that theme into YouTube and was inundated with YouTube videos from Rebel Media and one American News Network type channels. I ended up going down that rabbit hole. I ended up becoming a correspondent for Rebel Media of which I obtained millions of views. And my boss always told me, and the bosses of these other organizations always told me that we should never let the truth get in the way of a good story. And if we can get people angry, and if we can get people upset, we can make more money, we can make more profit, and we can drive the algorithms to keep pushing these videos. It's what made me feel very disenfranchised and I end up speaking out of it all at the end. But as someone who really believed in it and believed that free speech was under attack and that the West was being invaded and all these ideas that they were pushing, I really felt that if I had to take part in disinformation and take part in bending the truth, then it was for the greater good. But actually my boss is, and the people at the top of the Zico system, from Newsmax and all these organizations from Project Veritas, which collaborated with Breville at the time, it was all fair again, because the left were just so terrible. But actually the kind of tactics that they were engaged in, and even myself now looking back were engaged in, were far worse than the, quote unquote, liberal media and CNN, and any of these groups ever took part in. It was completely devoid of any realism or any journalism. We would go to quote unquote, no go zones in 2018 when Fox News would hype up that whole situation. And we would create conflict and then selectively edit it to look like those areas were far more dangerous than they were. Those videos would obtain millions and millions of views. Again, I regret that massively. The only reason I did it was because I was radicalized by those people and felt like it was for the greater good and it was a bit of a cult. But those people profited massively from it and it was always about pushing disinformation. Alex Jones, who I spent a lot of intimate time with and a lot of the people that employed me told me openly that they thought the whole pizza gate staff and the pizza file staff and all the stuff that they were pushing is something that they don't really care about, I already believe in.

According to that theory, left and right wing extremism actually have a lot in common, but here's why that's bullshit. For this one, we're gonna have to look at statistics from Germany because the US doesn't actually categorized politically motivated Crimes as right wing or left wing. First of all, the right wing has a lot more criminal energy than the left. Plus the criminal energy on the left is often directed towards property whereas that on the right is directed towards people. From 1990 to 2020, left wing extremism has killed four people in Germany. Where is right wing extremism? Well, so why is the leftist extremism talking points so popular with the alt-right? Simple.

And instead of apologizing like a good boy, you put up a joke ad site about special needs helmets to protect the people who are offended by you. And now, to get yourself out of trouble, you're gonna come on my podcast. I let us your plan. I was hoping it would make things way worse. Oh, it's way worse. Matt Rive's alt-right red pill journey is finally complete. You finally made it onto the Jordan Peterson podcast. Well done. The fact that Jordan Peterson finds you funny and wants to talk to you, it's not a good sign, babes. Not a good sign. I'm a huge fan, man. I've done extensive research into everything you've done, but I find you'd be a very kind man and very well spoken. Yeah, it's clear you have no idea what Jordan Peterson stands for because otherwise you would not be proud to be sat opposite him. The man who thought that a plus-size model on a magazine is authoritarian thought that your domestic violence joke was funny, shocking. Remember when he got suspended on Twitter because he was so aggressively transferred back towards Elliot Page? Or when he called doctors who provide gender-affirming care, butchers and that they should be treated with no mercy? What about the fact that he's a climate change denier who went on Joe Rogan to spread a bunch of conspiracy theories that were literally debunked by climate scientists? Can't imagine why Jordan Peterson would find misogyny funny. But no makeup in the workplace. Why would that be? Why should you wear makeup in the workplace? Isn't that sexually provocative? The redening of the lips, for example, and the raging of the cheeks is not only a signal to mimic youth and fertility, but it's likely associated with mimicry of ripe fruit because our visual system evolved to detect ripe fruit. No one tell them about purple lipstick or orange blush and she might blow his mind. It's a question about appropriate behavior in the workplace. That's very good. And I'm also not saying that women shouldn't wear makeup in the workplace. I said it's a question. Bro, God, so mad. He does have a point though. I don't think men should be shaving in the workplace because you know, enhances their jawline, which is obviously to enhance their sexual attractiveness. Men shouldn't wear suits in the workplace because you know you're accentuating your broad shoulders, which is an indicator of sexual attractiveness. Should men be wearing suits and shaving in the workplace? It's just a question. Actually, my favorite Jordan Peterson moment when he wasn't sure if he agreed with the legalisation of gay marriage or not. With regards to gay marriage specifically, that's a really tough one for me. It's a means whereby gay people can be integrated more thoroughly into standard society, and that's probably a good thing. It's probably a good thing that we let those gay freaks fit into standard normal society. This is who Matt Rife looks up to, and it's because they've both been cancelled. Instead of apologising for his transphobic misogynistic tweets and getting some social media training, Jordan Peterson would rather lose his licence to practice psychology. Rather than apologise for the insensitive jokes that he's made, Matt Rife has doubled down and run to the conservative safe space that is the daily wire. This interview is absolutely that shit insane. They conflate men who support women and are feminists with sneaky rapists. I saw one take to a video who was like, I have a wife and I found this severely disrespectful. I was like, okay, you cut. Yeah, whatever. Yeah, yeah. What do you want to get more money for? What do you want to get more money? I'll send you your wife. Bro, you only pretend you don't like jokes about men beating up women because you're trying to sleep with more women. Doesn't this go to show what they think about women? You only believe that a man would support women and support feminism for sexual gratification because that's the way you view women as a sexual conquest. A herodine woman who is screeching like fish wives, but the men that were hypothetically there to support the men I tell you, I couldn't even look at some of those guys, without having to shut her run up my spine. There's almost nothing worse than a man who tries to worm himself in with a group of women by pretending to be moral on their side than they women actually are. When their actual motivation is to use that, what was that guy said, the elderly sheary psychologist who works at Concordia, he called out the sneaky fucker, a routine. Hi, I'm a man. I support women. I support feminism. Am I just trying to fuck women? Oh, no, wait, one minute. I'm a homosexual. He justifies this point by bringing up orangutans. I'm not joking. There are two variant male types of orangutans. The males who become dominant. They get so large they can't really go in trees anymore. And the females come to them. But then there are other males in the vicinity. They look like adolescent males and they hang around in the trees. But they turn out to be many of them fully mature males whose development into the linebacker is forced all by the fact that they're north at the top of the pecking order. And so their strategy is sneaky rape. Right, right. So it doesn't take much of an imagination to map that on to the feminist male who's so on the side of women that he gets to be the friend who can entice some poor girl into bed when she's at her lowest point. Feminist men want to rape women. You know why? Because smaller orangutans rape other orangutans. I forgot that orangutans have the exact same complex understanding of human gender, gender theory, gender stereotypes, gender-based violence that we do. Fascinating. My other favorite part is drawing the prediscine and countering the concept of improvisation for the first time. You're doing... It seems to be something that's much more akin to spontaneous wit. That's a dangerous thing to do because you could easily be not funny. Because you're doing that, you don't have a lot of time to... Exactly. Think through what you're going to say, right? I mean, if something strikes you as amusing, you pretty much have to go for it. And if you're... If you're head full of censorship-related thoughts, you're going to be not funny in about 15 seconds. God, if only there was one word to describe that. I'm one of those assholes that takes improv classes. And one of the first things we were taught is that we have to allow for the likelihood that something offensive might occur. But if the first thing that comes to your mind is something misogynistic or transphobic, homophobic, etc. You might want to take a look at yourself. Why was that the first thing that came to your mind? Also, in my experience, the urge to say something offensive is a result of not trusting yourself that you are funny, and that you want to provoke a reaction in the audience. Because if the audience isn't laughing or reacting in the way that you expected them to, you might want to say something ridiculous outlandish offensive in order to provoke a response from them. Because any response from the audience is better than just dead silence. That is not good improvisation and it's not good comedy. Most of the scenes that I've done when I've resorted to insulting my partner or trying to start a conflict, kills the scene because it's not productive to the comedy. You also have to be very selective about the pain that you're exploiting for comedy. For example, as a gay person, I can make light of homophobia because I've experienced it. That is my pain that I share with myself and my community. I can make jokes out of that. Homophobia is something neither of these two men are ever going to have to really contend with. So it's not their place to make jokes out of it. Just like how it wasn't Matt Rive's place to make a joke out of a domestic violence situation. Why wasn't the punchline of that joke at the expense of the perpetrator of that violence rather than the victim of it? Running to conservatives and daddy Peterson who will protect you from the work liberals who are trying to cancel you is just cowardly. They'll complain about cancel culture and lick each other's wounds about how you can't tell misogynistic jokes anymore. This is the alt-right pint-plane in action. Don't fool for it.",subjective,jordan peterson

So what was the formula that you found work best? Well, when I first started all this, I had been consuming radical content on YouTube for about six months after the Orlando shooting. I remember I typed that theme into YouTube and was inundated with YouTube videos from Rebel Media and one American News Network type channels. I ended up going down that rabbit hole. I ended up becoming a correspondent for Rebel Media of which I obtained millions of views. And my boss always told me, and the bosses of these other organizations always told me that we should never let the truth get in the way of a good story. And if we can get people angry, and if we can get people upset, we can make more money, we can make more profit, and we can drive the algorithms to keep pushing these videos. It's what made me feel very disenfranchised and I end up speaking out of it all at the end. But as someone who really believed in it and believed that free speech was under attack and that the West was being invaded and all these ideas that they were pushing, I really felt that if I had to take part in disinformation and take part in bending the truth, then it was for the greater good. But actually my boss is, and the people at the top of the Zico system, from Newsmax and all these organizations from Project Veritas, which collaborated with Breville at the time, it was all fair again, because the left were just so terrible. But actually the kind of tactics that they were engaged in, and even myself now looking back were engaged in, were far worse than the, quote unquote, liberal media and CNN, and any of these groups ever took part in. It was completely devoid of any realism or any journalism. We would go to quote unquote, no go zones in 2018 when Fox News would hype up that whole situation. And we would create conflict and then selectively edit it to look like those areas were far more dangerous than they were. Those videos would obtain millions and millions of views. Again, I regret that massively. The only reason I did it was because I was radicalized by those people and felt like it was for the greater good and it was a bit of a cult. But those people profited massively from it and it was always about pushing disinformation. Alex Jones, who I spent a lot of intimate time with and a lot of the people that employed me told me openly that they thought the whole pizza gate staff and the pizza file staff and all the stuff that they were pushing is something that they don't really care about, I already believe in.

A.G. Kobach has said, quote, failing to disclose when a child is socially transitioning or identifying as non-binary at school violates a parent's rights. I want to zero in here on the fact that he said socially transition. We're not talking about medical intervention at this point. We're not talking about them taking hormones or puberty blockers or anything like that. We are purely talking about them using maybe a different name, maybe a different pronouns. And I gotta think that if a student is not telling their parent about their gender identity, there's probably a good reason for that. And the fact that he wants the state to intervene in four schools to out their kids is only going to harm trans and non-binary students. That's the point. It's also the fact that he said, schools should not socially transition students. As if schools are the ones who are facilitating the social transition and not the fact that like you said, kids are using school as a safe place to express themselves when their parents may be violent or abusive. Schools are not socially transitioning your children. Your children may decide to undergo social transition at school. And the school is kind of just a banal factor in that.

Beyond those efforts to protect this at the federal level from the Biden administration, you've also started to see blue states places like New York and Washington state that have also passed state laws saying that nobody should be able to get private medical records like this.

I can't believe this is real, it's real. This is the Republican Attorney General of Texas, his name is Ken Paxton, although he is not currently serving as Attorney General because he has been suspended from office by the Texas legislature pending an impeachment trial. Now how bad do things have to be for the Republicans in the Texas legislature to impeach their own Republican Attorney General? Well, where do we start? Almost the entire time he's been Attorney General, he's been under indictment for felony securities fraud. Meanwhile he's facing potential disbarment from the practice of law entirely over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Also he's under criminal investigation by the U.S. Justice Department on serious corruption allegations. Allegations so serious that eight high ranking officials in his own office went to the FBI to report what they had witnessed in his office. Earlier this year, Paxton reached a multi-million dollar settlement in a lawsuit for allegedly firing several of those officials as retaliation for them going to the FBI. It has been a lot with this guy, but hilariously it was only when Paxton demanded that Texas taxpayers fork over the millions of dollars to pay that settlement that Republicans in the legislature finally started to get a little bit cranky with him. The Texas House impeached Ken Paxton by an overwhelming margin. So that means the Texas Senate now has to put him on trial. They'll hold an impeachment trial in September. If he's convicted at that Senate impeachment trial, he will lose his job permanently. Now here's where it gets amazing. That trial will be presided over by the president of the Senate, the lieutenant governor of the state, a man named Dan Patrick. As the presiding judge overseeing Paxton's impeachment trial, he'll have immense power. He'll be the ultimate arbiter of the rules and the admissibility of evidence and all that stuff. Here's the thing I can't believe is real, but it is. So Dan Patrick, the guy who's the presiding judge in this impeachment trial, just had to release his new campaign finance report. And would you look at that? He just received three million dollars from the Ken Paxton Superback. Wow, what a coincidence. Dan Patrick isn't even up for reelection until 2026. All he has coming up is this impeachment trial that he has to run in a few weeks.

Yep, Republicans have already packed state Supreme courts. Oh, would you look at that? Georgia did it too. It's just everything they do is partisan. For power. And when they argue it would be wrong to, you know, expand the Supreme Court, it's just because they don't like the results and what would happen.

We are the representatives of the people and the people want this repealed. This is what we are arguing about right now whether or not we should overturn something that is archaic. Something that is going to really impact women in Arizona despite high profile Republicans like former president Trump saying the ban goes too far. The attempt to repeal it didn't get enough votes. Democrats needed 31 votes to prevail and were just one vote short. They had hoped at least two Republicans would repeal the effort in the end only one did. Some of us have believed that abortion is in fact the murder of children. Opponents of abortion rights welcome today's outcome. We need to save freedom in our state. We need to save our Constitution. Our our rights are under threat every single day, including the right to life. Arizona Democrats also tried to repeal the ban last week, but were prevented by the Republican majority. Today abortion rights advocates vowed to press on. Any extreme ban will kill women and pregnant people. It will force pregnancy on people who cannot or do not want to have a child. They see they've gathered enough signatures for a November ballot initiative that would restore abortion rights until fetal viability, which doctors say is between 23 and 24 weeks. I don't have the words to describe how angry I am about it. This is the reason why I'm out here is to be the part of this community. Abortion is currently legal in Arizona up to 15 weeks.

I want to zero in here on the fact that he said socially transition. We're not talking about medical intervention at this point. We're not talking about them taking hormones or puberty blockers or anything like that. We are purely talking about them using maybe a different name, maybe a different pronouns. And I gotta think that if a student is not telling their parent about their gender identity, there's probably a good reason for that. And the fact that he wants the state to intervene in four schools to out their kids is only going to harm trans and non-binary students. That's the point. It's also the fact that he said, schools should not socially transition students. As if schools are the ones who are facilitating the social transition and not the fact that like you said, kids are using school as a safe place to express themselves when their parents may be violent or abusive. Schools are not socially transitioning your children. Your children may decide to undergo social transition at school. And the school is kind of just a banal factor in that.

I can't believe this is real, it's real. This is the Republican Attorney General of Texas, his name is Ken Paxton, although he is not currently serving as Attorney General because he has been suspended from office by the Texas legislature pending an impeachment trial. Now how bad do things have to be for the Republicans in the Texas legislature to impeach their own Republican Attorney General? Well, where do we start? Almost the entire time he's been Attorney General, he's been under indictment for felony securities fraud. Meanwhile he's facing potential disbarment from the practice of law entirely over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Also he's under criminal investigation by the U.S. Justice Department on serious corruption allegations. Allegations so serious that eight high ranking officials in his own office went to the FBI to report what they had witnessed in his office. Earlier this year, Paxton reached a multi-million dollar settlement in a lawsuit for allegedly firing several of those officials as retaliation for them going to the FBI. It has been a lot with this guy, but hilariously it was only when Paxton demanded that Texas taxpayers fork over the millions of dollars to pay that settlement that Republicans in the legislature finally started to get a little bit cranky with him. The Texas House impeached Ken Paxton by an overwhelming margin. So that means the Texas Senate now has to put him on trial. They'll hold an impeachment trial in September. If he's convicted at that Senate impeachment trial, he will lose his job permanently. Now here's where it gets amazing. That trial will be presided over by the president of the Senate, the lieutenant governor of the state, a man named Dan Patrick. As the presiding judge overseeing Paxton's impeachment trial, he'll have immense power. He'll be the ultimate arbiter of the rules and the admissibility of evidence and all that stuff. Here's the thing I can't believe is real, but it is. So Dan Patrick, the guy who's the presiding judge in this impeachment trial, just had to release his new campaign finance report. And would you look at that? He just received three million dollars from the Ken Paxton Superback. Wow, what a coincidence. Dan Patrick isn't even up for reelection until 2026. All he has coming up is this impeachment trial that he has to run in a few weeks. And here's the pack for the defendant in that impeachment trial dumping three million dollars on his porch just ahead of the trial. Wow, everything is bigger in Texas.

He's been the lead prosecutor since he was appointed by President Trump. Okay. Why? Let me ask you. Why has the Justice Department dragged this investigation out for so long? Does it really take years to determine if 100-Biden lied on a federal form related to person if are? Mr. Wies was a long time career prosecutor. President Trump appointed him as the... You're not answering the question. Is that standard procedure? Should it take that long to make such a simple determination? I'm answering the question. Mm-hmm. Give me an opportunity to do so. Okay. He was charged with that investigation under the previous administration. He's continued. He knows how to conduct investigations. And I have not intruded or attempted to evaluate that. Because that was the promise I made to the Senate. The whistleblowers gave us testimony about serious misconduct at the Justice Department in regards to the preferential treatment of 400-Biden. Has your office requested an investigation into that? There are well-known processes for how whistleblowers make their claims. I am a strong proponent of whistleblowers and a strong defender.

I mean, if this is what they say they want to do and it is, how do you get away from it? The reason they've written to the Biden administration saying they claim this right is because the Biden administration says they should not have the right to do this. The Biden administration is trying to assert federally that attorneys general from states where abortion is banned can't follow their residents to other states to see if they're getting banned care from someplace where it's legal. Beyond those efforts to protect this at the federal level from the Biden administration, you've also started to see blue states places like New York and Washington state that have also passed state laws saying that nobody should be able to get private medical records like this. Just because you've banned abortion in your state doesn't mean you can effectively enforce it in mind. But here's 19 Republican states, 19 Republican state attorney general saying they're going for it. And maybe they already are. When reporter Joe Sanka from the Louisville Courier Journal today asked the Kentucky Attorney General's Office if they have already pursued private medical records from Kentucky women who've had medical treatment in other states, the Attorney General's Office didn't give Joe Sanka an answer. He says he has still not heard back from the Attorney General's Office about this, which leaves open the possibility that maybe they are already doing this, maybe they are already trying or getting these medical records. They used to say that the Republican Party was the party of limited government. This is a lot of things, but this is not that.",subjective,reproductive

I can't believe this is real, it's real. This is the Republican Attorney General of Texas, his name is Ken Paxton, although he is not currently serving as Attorney General because he has been suspended from office by the Texas legislature pending an impeachment trial. Now how bad do things have to be for the Republicans in the Texas legislature to impeach their own Republican Attorney General? Well, where do we start? Almost the entire time he's been Attorney General, he's been under indictment for felony securities fraud. Meanwhile he's facing potential disbarment from the practice of law entirely over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Also he's under criminal investigation by the U.S. Justice Department on serious corruption allegations. Allegations so serious that eight high ranking officials in his own office went to the FBI to report what they had witnessed in his office. Earlier this year, Paxton reached a multi-million dollar settlement in a lawsuit for allegedly firing several of those officials as retaliation for them going to the FBI. It has been a lot with this guy, but hilariously it was only when Paxton demanded that Texas taxpayers fork over the millions of dollars to pay that settlement that Republicans in the legislature finally started to get a little bit cranky with him. The Texas House impeached Ken Paxton by an overwhelming margin. So that means the Texas Senate now has to put him on trial. They'll hold an impeachment trial in September. If he's convicted at that Senate impeachment trial, he will lose his job permanently. Now here's where it gets amazing. That trial will be presided over by the president of the Senate, the lieutenant governor of the state, a man named Dan Patrick. As the presiding judge overseeing Paxton's impeachment trial, he'll have immense power. He'll be the ultimate arbiter of the rules and the admissibility of evidence and all that stuff. Here's the thing I can't believe is real, but it is. So Dan Patrick, the guy who's the presiding judge in this impeachment trial, just had to release his new campaign finance report. And would you look at that? He just received three million dollars from the Ken Paxton Superback. Wow, what a coincidence. Dan Patrick isn't even up for reelection until 2026. All he has coming up is this impeachment trial that he has to run in a few weeks. And here's the pack for the defendant in that impeachment trial dumping three million dollars on his porch just ahead of the trial. Wow, everything is bigger in Texas.

In October, for instance, they raised half of what they've raised in previous years. The RNC stated they had the least amount of cash on hand since February of 2015. Why is this? Well, because nobody wants to support Donald Trump. Contrary to what's happening with the population, the people that are higher up don't want to fund him. And the answer is to why is pretty simple. He keeps using their money for legal fees. In fact, in the first half of this year, Donald Trump spent something like $42 million on staying ahead of jail and only 15 million campaigning. And with the New York fraud case going on, he's not likely to have that much money left, meaning he's going to run in campaign until the wheels fall off because he needs to raise money to stay out of jail. That may not seem that important, but we know that spending millions of dollars or tens of millions of dollars to get people out to vote does affect elections.

I asked an AI expert about the risk of using this new technology in political messaging. You know, people complain about disinformation in the 2020 election. They haven't seen anything yet. 2024 is going to be a lot worse. There are a few ways to check whether an image is fake or real, like distorted backgrounds or body parts. But as the technology improves, it can become harder to distinguish real images from fake ones. The generative AI is getting a lot better at hands and necks. And so we're pretty much at the point where even real experts cannot distinguish the fake from the real.

I know the fundraising stuff is the boring part of politics, but this is why I think the Republicans are going to lose. The Republicans are raising significantly less amount of money. In October, for instance, they raised half of what they've raised in previous years. The RNC stated they had the least amount of cash on hand since February of 2015. Why is this? Well, because nobody wants to support Donald Trump. Contrary to what's happening with the population, the people that are higher up don't want to fund him. And the answer is to why is pretty simple. He keeps using their money for legal fees. In fact, in the first half of this year, Donald Trump spent something like $42 million on staying ahead of jail and only 15 million campaigning. And with the New York fraud case going on, he's not likely to have that much money left, meaning he's going to run in campaign until the wheels fall off because he needs to raise money to stay out of jail. That may not seem that important, but we know that spending millions of dollars or tens of millions of dollars to get people out to vote does affect elections.

In October, for instance, they raised half of what they've raised in previous years. The RNC stated they had the least amount of cash on hand since February of 2015. Why is this? Well, because nobody wants to support Donald Trump. Contrary to what's happening with the population, the people that are higher up don't want to fund him. And the answer is to why is pretty simple. He keeps using their money for legal fees. In fact, in the first half of this year, Donald Trump spent something like $42 million on staying ahead of jail and only 15 million campaigning. And with the New York fraud case going on, he's not likely to have that much money left, meaning he's going to run in campaign until the wheels fall off because he needs to raise money to stay out of jail. That may not seem that important, but we know that spending millions of dollars or tens of millions of dollars to get people out to vote does affect elections. And for right now, in the foreseeable future, the Democrats should be in the brakes off of Republicans and fundraising.",subjective,fundraising

I asked an AI expert about the risk of using this new technology in political messaging. You know, people complain about disinformation in the 2020 election. They haven't seen anything yet. 2024 is going to be a lot worse. There are a few ways to check whether an image is fake or real, like distorted backgrounds or body parts. But as the technology improves, it can become harder to distinguish real images from fake ones. The generative AI is getting a lot better at hands and necks. And so we're pretty much at the point where even real experts cannot distinguish the fake from the real. In political ads generated by AI are likely to become more common in the lead up to the 2024 election. Judges for many years have elevated political speech to a highly protected category.

The Republican National Committee, RNC, has withdrawn a resolution that aimed to declare Donald Trump the party's presumptive 2024 nominee before he formally secures the required number of delegates, according to a source familiar with the matter. The resolution, if approved, would have solidified Trump's position within the party and signaled a unified front ahead of the 2024 election. However, Trump expressed on his truth social platform that, for the sake of party unity, the RNC should not proceed with the plan. The withdrawal comes amid ongoing competition between Trump and other GOP candidates, notably Nikki Haley for the party's nomination. The draft resolution obtained by the Associated Press had declared Trump as the presumptive nominee moving into full-general election mode. RNC chair Ronna McDaniel had initially signaled support for the resolution, emphasising the need for Republicans to unikey around the eventual nominee. The decision to withdraw the resolution comes as the RNC's winter meeting approaches where discussions were expected to take place. Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, who finished second to Trump in the New Hampshire primary, has been actively campaigning, and her camp responded to the RNC's actions by stating that the party's nominee should be decided by millions of Republican voters, not Washington insiders. Despite the withdrawal, Trump continues to exert influence within the party, with a recent social media post, warning that anyone contributing to Haley's campaign would be permanently barred from the MAGA camp. The resolution's withdrawal indicates the complexity of managing power dynamics within the party, with concerns about potential disruptions to existing structures. It also reflects a broader debate within the GOP about the direction and leadership of the party heading into the 2024 elections. The decision highlights the challenges of navigating internal dynamics, and the preference for party unity, with the ultimate nominee yet to be determined. The RNC's move to withdraw the resolution underscores the ongoing jockeying for influence and support among GOP contenders, as they navigate a competitive landscape in the lead up to the 2024 election.",subjective,party dynamics

They are having trouble raising money. What's going on? Well, the large Republican donors and the corporations they don't like Trump. They don't want to give money to the Republican National Committee if Trump is going to be the winner. They don't like Trump. They don't like Trump. They don't like Trump. So Governor DeSantis was their fairhead boy until the furor started going down the toilet. And you have DeSantis now showing that he is a dud. And so they stopped giving Monty for DeSantis. Because they didn't think he's going to win. And the other back will let Trump go to the winner. They don't want to help Trump because they don't like Trump. So then their next fairhead boy was Tim Scott. So they started falling in love with Tim Scott. And then recently there have been several articles published in different publications. They are beginning to say, oh, wait a minute. Tim Scott is not married. Why is Tim Scott not married? Could it be that Tim Scott is in the closet? So now they don't want to give money to Tim Scott because he's not married to a woman. And they're worried about his preferences in life. And I don't know what they are. Whether he's single or he want to be single. He's gay. He's straight. Whatever. I have no idea. It's not, you know, I could care less. He could be whatever he wants to be. It doesn't bother me. But now they're afraid to give to him because they're concerned that he's not married to a woman. So they stop giving. All right. So where else do you get money from? Where do you get money from the middle and the little people? Well, they've never done well with these people. They've never done well with the little people. And guess who's sucking up all the little money? All the little red people are given to Trump. Trump is like a vacuum cleaner. Well, his legal bills, you know, suppose he's going to campaign, but it's paying his legal stuff. I thought Trump had all those billions. Baby, you ain't got no money. You don't have any money. Otherwise, why do you need their money? You don't. That's just it. So they're giving money. So the Republican National Committee has $11.8 million in the bank because nobody wants to give money to them because they're afraid of who the candidate's going to be. So I just find that quite interesting. And I'll have to Google to see about how the Democratic National Committee stands. But I have a feeling they got more than 11.8 million in the bank. But good luck. Good luck running an National Campaign running for the governors that are up.

According to the Associated Press, the invitation says that their nations will first go to Trump's campaign, then to save America back, and then finally the R&C and state political parties. Because Donald Trump is going to be the nominee, it gives him access to larger donations. Unlike candidates who can only receive up to $3,300 in donations, this arrangement allows for a single donor to donate up to $800,000 and a couple to donate up to $1.6 million. When those checks are written, Trump's campaign and save America get paid first before the R&C ever sees a dime. So typically a national party committee looks out for down-belly candidates around the country and provides them with assistance like research, polling, financial support to help their campaign. But with this new agreement between the R&C and Donald Trump, it effectively serves as a way for Donald Trump to get all his legal bills paid.",subjective,campaign finance

In 2016 and 2017, federal courts ruled that both of these maps were unconstitutional. They said what North Carolina Republicans did wasn't just gerrymandering. It was racial gerrymandering, done to deliberately dilute the political power of black people. The courts said the Republicans in the North Carolina State House now have to redraw the lines without looking at racial demographics. So, they went back to Tom Houghler. This time Houghler couldn't look at race. Instead, he looked at which area is voted for Democrats and which area is voted for Republicans. Instead of a racial gerrymander, it would be a partisan gerrymander. Here's that map using data from 2014. The bluer in area, the more Democratic voters there are. Now, if you zoom in here to Greensboro, you can see one of the highest concentrations of Democratic voters in the state. Houghler drew a congressional district line to crack this community in half. This meant Democrats here for now in the minority and their district. And Democrats here were also in the minority and their district. Houghler employed these techniques all over the state to create North Carolina's new political districts. And the first big test for these new maps would be the 2018 election. Democrats were expected to turn out in drove. Democrats are vying for a potential blue wave. The wave that Republicans fear is going to wipe them up. So, how do the maps do? For state representatives, Democrats got 51% of the vote. They only won 46% of seats. For state senate, they received half the vote and won just 42% of seats. And for Congress, you already know how that one turned out. Democrats won nearly half the votes, but won only three out of 13 seats. A year later in 2019, the Supreme Court weighed in. They said it was beyond their reach. That it wasn't their job to fix it. All of this raised an existential question. If Republicans could continue drawing the lines of stay in power, how could they ever be elected out of office? But the Supreme Court's ruling left open the possibility for state courts to rule on partisan gerrymandering. And in September 2019, that's exactly what North Carolina's Supreme Court did. The court found that partisan gerrymandering violated the state constitution. In the court's decision, it was Houghler's files that helped prove that North Carolina Republicans drew these lines with a clear intention of benefiting themselves. Ultimately, the court said North Carolina Republicans had to redraw the state house and state senate maps. One more time. This new map, approved by North Carolina legislators, is much less biased toward one party, even though it took some extreme measures and nearly a decade to force politicians to draw a fair map. In the last few years, the courts in several states, like Florida and Pennsylvania, have made partisan gerrymandering much harder. And now that's also the case in North Carolina. Houghler's gone now. But in other states across the country, many maps he helped draw are still in use. And while there's now a clear strategy to challenge those maps in state courts, many voters are still, effectively, not choosing their representatives. It's like Houghler said, the representatives are choosing the voters. Of course, redistricting is democracy at work. Redistricting is like an election in reverse. It's a great event.",subjective,gerr

Threatening to hang people. Bringing zip ties to take people hostage. Ransacking lawmakers' offices stealing things and taking a shit and smearing it on the walls. That's legitimate political discourse to the GOP. They have lost their collective minds. Between this and book burning and cameras and people's classrooms and enemies lists and voter suppression and calling to jail their political opponents, let's be very clear. The Republican party have abandoned democracy and advocated their responsibility to the American experiment. Less we forget on the day of this event, most of these same people made speeches that absolutely denigrated what had happened because it was disgusting lawless behavior and they knew it. And then they changed their tune to try to blame it on outside groups like Antifa and BLM. Then they created a conspiracy theory blaming the FBI and the deep state but voted against looking into it. And when we tried to have a bipartisan commission, they voted against it. And when we tried to set up a bipartisan committee, they refused to have any of their members sit on it. And now that we are discovering just piles of evidence that people at the highest level of command in the Republican party in the White House were involved in an active coup and this horrific attack was part of the plan. They are now officially claiming the entire thing was legitimate political discourse. This is appalling and any reasonable conservative needs to look at this and say this is not what I stand for. This is not who I am. Because the Republicans have planted their flag deep in authoritarianism where violence is power and lies are truth and the entire party operates around the cult of a leader.

I am talking about the 16 fake electors from Michigan, and we're going to give them a name. We need to know exactly who they are because they know exactly what they were doing and check out their ages and their job responsibility. So we are now currently on Mary and Henry. She is 65. She is the treasurer of the fifth congressional district Republican committee. According to the website, um, yeah, this is what she does. She's 65 and that's that's what she's doing. Then we have Michelle Lundgren. She's 73. These, these, please Lord, when I'm 73, I better be doing something great other than trying to undermine an election. Anyway, she was the Republican nominee in 2022 for the Detroit Bay see in Michigan House of Representative, but lost because it's a lot of Democrats is Detroit. Um, anyway, regardless, regarding that fake electors plot, she told CNN last year, we will call it on the phone, ask if we will come and support President Trump and sign something and we all went to Lansing. Sounds to me like you're trying to play that card. I didn't know any better. And we would just told to show up and sign this paper. If we had any information about it being untoward, or what is it? Untoward or illegal, we would not have done it. Uh, not according to the first person I was talking about because she is doubling down. So you're basically saying it's a mistake that you sign a paper who didn't know what it's about. Everybody else seems to know exactly what they were doing. So I don't believe you 73. Mm-hmm. Then we have Clifford Frost. It seems like they're getting older. He's 75. He's a realtor who unsuccessfully ran for Mac, Maycombe, County Board of Commissioners last year. He was a GOP poll watcher in Detroit during the 2020 primaries. And of course, in recent days, he has shared pro-Trump conspiracy theories about alleged voter fraud on social media. I think they're talking about like these recent days. He knows he's in trouble. Oh my God. It gets even worse. Okay. John Haggard is 82. Too. What is going on here? He was part of the frivolous lawsuit that tried to overturn the election in 2020. Of course it was dismissed. Um, yeah. He served as a legitimate Trump elector from Michigan in 2016. That time, he was legitimate. So he should know exactly how the process works. He's 82 guys. And this is what you're doing with your life. Timothy King. Finally, somebody who's 56. He was also part of the frivolous lawsuit that tried to overturn the 2020 election. Loss of dismiss. Rose Rook is 81 a member of the Executive Committee of the Van Buren County Republicans.

I know the fundraising stuff is the boring part of politics, but this is why I think the Republicans are going to lose. The Republicans are raising significantly less amount of money. In October, for instance, they raised half of what they've raised in previous years. The RNC stated they had the least amount of cash on hand since February of 2015. Why is this? Well, because nobody wants to support Donald Trump. Contrary to what's happening with the population, the people that are higher up don't want to fund him. And the answer is to why is pretty simple. He keeps using their money for legal fees. In fact, in the first half of this year, Donald Trump spent something like $42 million on staying ahead of jail and only 15 million campaigning. And with the New York fraud case going on, he's not likely to have that much money left, meaning he's going to run in campaign until the wheels fall off because he needs to raise money to stay out of jail. That may not seem that important, but we know that spending millions of dollars or tens of millions of dollars to get people out to vote does affect elections. And for right now, in the foreseeable future, the Democrats should be in the brakes off of Republicans and fundraising.",subjective,campaign finance

But why is it still so hard to convince right-wing Christians when they follow a teacher who said the truth will set you free? Even though lawyers in court for Sidney Powell, Trump's 2020 big lie attorney said no reasonable person would believe anything she said. And when Tucker Carlson was at Fox News, his attorney's argued he couldn't be held to a journalistic standard because anyone with a brain would know he was just an entertainer, not a purveyor of truth and news. And Tucker cost Fox News hundreds of billions of dollars in the Dominion voting system case. Yet still more than 80% of Republican voters, many of whom are Christians, will say there was something wrong in the 2020 election. And the interesting thing is Jesus said it would be this way, said the 11 of bad religion would take away eyes to see and ears to hear from followers of that religion. And Jeremiah and the Hebrew scripture said, don't listen to those prophets who say God wants to make our country great again, but know that we are in trouble because we've forgotten how to take care of the poor, the foreigner, the marginalized and the economically disadvantaged. So when a God follower chooses to follow this guy instead of reality, it's actually just history repeating itself. So how do we avoid falling into the trap of that echo chamber that makes us believe somebody like Rudy Giuliani over real live truth? And dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of court cases? Well, the Bible talks about open-heartedness versus hard-heartedness. Open-heartedness is when you have a powerful identity that says, I can hear things that disagree with the dogma and indoctrination of my community. Because I care about truth more than inclusion in an exclusive group or sect. Christianity browbeats people into conformity to the message and defending even up to the case of dissonance. But when we open our heart and say we want to learn, have our mind renewed as it says in Romans 12, then we start to know what is good and right and true. And the Bible calls this wisdom that we should want more than gold or silver. If you have relatives stuck in Mago world and believe Rudy Giuliani or Tucker Carlson, there's not a lot you can do other than fight for your own identity and let your transformation be reflected to those around you. And just display what it looks like to pursue truth even when it disagrees with what you believe.",subjective,election misinformation

But why is it still so hard to convince right-wing Christians when they follow a teacher who said the truth will set you free? Even though lawyers in court for Sidney Powell, Trump's 2020 big lie attorney said no reasonable person would believe anything she said. And when Tucker Carlson was at Fox News, his attorney's argued he couldn't be held to a journalistic standard because anyone with a brain would know he was just an entertainer, not a purveyor of truth and news. And Tucker cost Fox News hundreds of billions of dollars in the Dominion voting system case. Yet still more than 80% of Republican voters, many of whom are Christians, will say there was something wrong in the 2020 election. And the interesting thing is Jesus said it would be this way, said the 11 of bad religion would take away eyes to see and ears to hear from followers of that religion. And Jeremiah and the Hebrew scripture said, don't listen to those prophets who say God wants to make our country great again, but know that we are in trouble because we've forgotten how to take care of the poor, the foreigner, the marginalized and the economically disadvantaged. So when a God follower chooses to follow this guy instead of reality, it's actually just history repeating itself. So how do we avoid falling into the trap of that echo chamber that makes us believe somebody like Rudy Giuliani over real live truth? And dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of court cases? Well, the Bible talks about open-heartedness versus hard-heartedness. Open-heartedness is when you have a powerful identity that says, I can hear things that disagree with the dogma and indoctrination of my community. Because I care about truth more than inclusion in an exclusive group or sect. Christianity browbeats people into conformity to the message and defending even up to the case of dissonance. But when we open our heart and say we want to learn, have our mind renewed as it says in Romans 12, then we start to know what is good and right and true. And the Bible calls this wisdom that we should want more than gold or silver. If you have relatives stuck in Mago world and believe Rudy Giuliani or Tucker Carlson, there's not a lot you can do other than fight for your own identity and let your transformation be reflected to those around you.

For his alleged role in a hushed money payment to Stormy Daniels weeks before the 2016 presidential election, the Manhattan Grand Juries indictment is the latest blow for the real estate Titan, whose golden pompadour and once golden property portfolio have come under public scrutiny since taking political office seven years ago. Let's take a look back at the nation's first developer in chief and his Manhattan real estate history. As Trump told the real deals editor-in-chief Stewart Elliott in a 2003 TRD cover story, I'm the biggest developer in New York. I've done that with positive thinking. Trump's trademark self-regard proved advantageous early on. After launching his real estate career with his father's company Trump Management in the late 1960s, he ventured out on his own in 1971 with the Trump Organization. In 1975, the Queen's native, then 29 years old, struck his first big Manhattan deal to purchase the Commodore Hotel, a once grand but by then ramshackle money-losing enterprise next to Grand Central Terminal. Trump's father Fred, who made his fortune building meat and potatoes middle-class housing in the burrows, likened the effort to buy the hotel to fighting for a seat on the Titanic. But Trump's artful deal-making soon emerged. Prior to signing the contract, he talked local politicians into granting him an unheard of $40-year $56-million tax abatement, and near-card blanche to reimagine the site. Trump reopened the $1,400 key hotel in 1980 as the grand high-end. The swash-buckling deal-making of the mid-1980s served as the backdrop for a man-hatten real estate free by Trump, including Trump Tower and Midtown, which opened in 1983, and Trump laws on the Upper East Side, which opened in 1984. As well as a string of Atlantic City casino hotels, Trump also bought the West Side rail yards on the Upper West Side in 1984 to build what he envisioned as television city. For a time, Trump's persona carried him to the heights of mobile-dom, until he overexcended himself and came crashing back down to Earth in the great real estate bust of the late 1980s. According to the reports of the time, Trump owed at $1.8 billion. $975-million of it personally guaranteed, but Fortune soon favored Trump. In 1988, he acquired the iconic Plaza Hotel, with $407-million borrowed from banks. He sold the landmark luxury property in 1995, but remains associated with the hotel to the present day. One of the developers crowning man-hatten achievements came in 1994 when he unveiled the Trump International Hotel in Tower in Columbus Circle. A 52-story luxury hotel and apartment complex was Trump deemed the best project in New York by a factor of 10. Trump commanded an unprecedented $1,000 per square foot for the development, shaking up the city's upper end condo market. Two years later, he bought 40 Wall Street, a 71-story skyscraper in the financial district, later rebranding it as the Trump building. He rounded out the century with the development of Trump World Tower, a 376-unit condo in Midtown's Turtle Bay that was briefly the tallest residential tower in the world. The 21st century saw Trump take on everything from golf courses to reality television, curious to hear more from the man himself?

In order to stop him from running again in 2024, let me ask you a question. How much do you think Mar-a-Lago is worth? Mar-a-Lago, obviously, Donald Trump's home golf club, resort in West Palm Beach, Florida? I mean, look at this thing. How much do you think it would cost on Zillow? Well, according to a New York judge, the answer to that question is $18 million. So keep in mind, the combined cost when Donald Trump bought Mar-a-Lago in 1985 was $20 million. But this judge ruled that the Trump Organization committed fraud by undervaluing Mar-a-Lago and completely revoked the Trump Organization's business license in the state. This, by the way, all stems from a civil lawsuit that was filed against the Trump Organization by New York Attorney General Latisha James, who literally ran for the office promising to go after the Trumps. She literally promised to search for a crime against the leading political opponent of her party. Textbook weaponization of the legal system. Now, she spent years investigating them and she could never find an actual crime because there was none. So she had to file a civil suit against them. And there was also not even a trial in this civil suit. There were no hearings, no evidence presented, no cross-examination, not even a jury. But this Supreme Court justice Arthur and Goran just made this ruling. Just decided on a whim that Mar-a-Lago is only worth $18 million. Keep in mind, you can get a blank slate of land in West Palm Beach for $200 million. They have listings in Palm Beach that are just trees for $150 million. Rush Limbaugh's widow sold their Palm Beach mansion, which is much smaller than Mar-a-Lago, for $155 million. This is completely insane weaponization of the legal system. But liberals don't care. They're perfectly happy with it. They're cheering it on. They will literally destroy every foundational principle that our country stands for in order to stop Donald Trump from becoming president again.",subjective,legal battle

Meanwhile, Trump's West Palm Beach golf course was looking for five temporary foreign workers to wait tables. The positions at Trump winery pay $14.16 an hour. The Department of Homeland Security's guidelines allow employers to retain temporary foreign workers if there are not enough US workers who are able, willing, qualified, and available to do the temporary work. The unemployment rate in Virginia, as of December, sat at 3%, which is low, but a slight uptick from previous months. Spokespeople for the Trump organization did not respond to inquiries.

One of the developers crowning man-hatten achievements came in 1994 when he unveiled the Trump International Hotel in Tower in Columbus Circle. A 52-story luxury hotel and apartment complex was Trump deemed the best project in New York by a factor of 10. Trump commanded an unprecedented $1,000 per square foot for the development, shaking up the city's upper end condo market. Two years later, he bought 40 Wall Street, a 71-story skyscraper in the financial district, later rebranding it as the Trump building. He rounded out the century with the development of Trump World Tower, a 376-unit condo in Midtown's Turtle Bay that was briefly the tallest residential tower in the world.

In order to stop him from running again in 2024, let me ask you a question. How much do you think Mar-a-Lago is worth? Mar-a-Lago, obviously, Donald Trump's home golf club, resort in West Palm Beach, Florida? I mean, look at this thing. How much do you think it would cost on Zillow? Well, according to a New York judge, the answer to that question is $18 million. So keep in mind, the combined cost when Donald Trump bought Mar-a-Lago in 1985 was $20 million. But this judge ruled that the Trump Organization committed fraud by undervaluing Mar-a-Lago and completely revoked the Trump Organization's business license in the state. This, by the way, all stems from a civil lawsuit that was filed against the Trump Organization by New York Attorney General Latisha James, who literally ran for the office promising to go after the Trumps. She literally promised to search for a crime against the leading political opponent of her party. Textbook weaponization of the legal system. Now, she spent years investigating them and she could never find an actual crime because there was none. So she had to file a civil suit against them. And there was also not even a trial in this civil suit. There were no hearings, no evidence presented, no cross-examination, not even a jury. But this Supreme Court justice Arthur and Goran just made this ruling. Just decided on a whim that Mar-a-Lago is only worth $18 million. Keep in mind, you can get a blank slate of land in West Palm Beach for $200 million. They have listings in Palm Beach that are just trees for $150 million. Rush Limbaugh's widow sold their Palm Beach mansion, which is much smaller than Mar-a-Lago, for $155 million. This is completely insane weaponization of the legal system. But liberals don't care. They're perfectly happy with it. They're cheering it on. They will literally destroy every foundational principle that our country stands for in order to stop Donald Trump from becoming president again.",subjective,legal battle

The Department of Homeland Security's guidelines allow employers to retain temporary foreign workers if there are not enough US workers who are able, willing, qualified, and available to do the temporary work.

Let's take a look back at the nation‚Äôs first developer-in-chief and his #Manhattan #realestate history. | #FYP #TheRealDeal ,False,,therealdealnews,The Real Deal,,,,,,False,Trump Organization,2021,@therealdealnews_video_7218637857127140650.txt," The city where Donald Trump built his empire has charged the Trump Organization developer. For his alleged role in a hushed money payment to Stormy Daniels weeks before the 2016 presidential election, the Manhattan Grand Juries indictment is the latest blow for the real estate Titan, whose golden pompadour and once golden property portfolio have come under public scrutiny since taking political office seven years ago. Let's take a look back at the nation's first developer in chief and his Manhattan real estate history. As Trump told the real deals editor-in-chief Stewart Elliott in a 2003 TRD cover story, I'm the biggest developer in New York. I've done that with positive thinking. Trump's trademark self-regard proved advantageous early on. After launching his real estate career with his father's company Trump Management in the late 1960s, he ventured out on his own in 1971 with the Trump Organization. In 1975, the Queen's native, then 29 years old, struck his first big Manhattan deal to purchase the Commodore Hotel, a once grand but by then ramshackle money-losing enterprise next to Grand Central Terminal. Trump's father Fred, who made his fortune building meat and potatoes middle-class housing in the burrows, likened the effort to buy the hotel to fighting for a seat on the Titanic. But Trump's artful deal-making soon emerged. Prior to signing the contract, he talked local politicians into granting him an unheard of $40-year $56-million tax abatement, and near-card blanche to reimagine the site. Trump reopened the $1,400 key hotel in 1980 as the grand high-end. The swash-buckling deal-making of the mid-1980s served as the backdrop for a man-hatten real estate free by Trump, including Trump Tower and Midtown, which opened in 1983, and Trump laws on the Upper East Side, which opened in 1984. As well as a string of Atlantic City casino hotels, Trump also bought the West Side rail yards on the Upper West Side in 1984 to build what he envisioned as television city. For a time, Trump's persona carried him to the heights of mobile-dom, until he overexcended himself and came crashing back down to Earth in the great real estate bust of the late 1980s. According to the reports of the time, Trump owed at $1.8 billion. $975-million of it personally guaranteed, but Fortune soon favored Trump. In 1988, he acquired the iconic Plaza Hotel, with $407-million borrowed from banks. He sold the landmark luxury property in 1995, but remains associated with the hotel to the present day. One of the developers crowning man-hatten achievements came in 1994 when he unveiled the Trump International Hotel in Tower in Columbus Circle. A 52-story luxury hotel and apartment complex was Trump deemed the best project in New York by a factor of 10. Trump commanded an unprecedented $1,000 per square foot for the development, shaking up the city's upper end condo market. Two years later, he bought 40 Wall Street, a 71-story skyscraper in the financial district, later rebranding it as the Trump building. He rounded out the century with the development of Trump World Tower, a 376-unit condo in Midtown's Turtle Bay that was briefly the tallest residential tower in the world. The 21st century saw Trump take on everything from golf courses to reality television, curious to hear more from the man himself?

In order to stop him from running again in 2024, let me ask you a question. How much do you think Mar-a-Lago is worth? Mar-a-Lago, obviously, Donald Trump's home golf club, resort in West Palm Beach, Florida? I mean, look at this thing. How much do you think it would cost on Zillow? Well, according to a New York judge, the answer to that question is $18 million. So keep in mind, the combined cost when Donald Trump bought Mar-a-Lago in 1985 was $20 million. But this judge ruled that the Trump Organization committed fraud by undervaluing Mar-a-Lago and completely revoked the Trump Organization's business license in the state. This, by the way, all stems from a civil lawsuit that was filed against the Trump Organization by New York Attorney General Latisha James, who literally ran for the office promising to go after the Trumps. She literally promised to search for a crime against the leading political opponent of her party. Textbook weaponization of the legal system. Now, she spent years investigating them and she could never find an actual crime because there was none. So she had to file a civil suit against them. And there was also not even a trial in this civil suit. There were no hearings, no evidence presented, no cross-examination, not even a jury. But this Supreme Court justice Arthur and Goran just made this ruling. Just decided on a whim that Mar-a-Lago is only worth $18 million. Keep in mind, you can get a blank slate of land in West Palm Beach for $200 million. They have listings in Palm Beach that are just trees for $150 million. Rush Limbaugh's widow sold their Palm Beach mansion, which is much smaller than Mar-a-Lago, for $155 million. This is completely insane weaponization of the legal system. But liberals don't care. They're perfectly happy with it. They're cheering it on. They will literally destroy every foundational principle that our country stands for in order to stop Donald Trump from becoming president again.",subjective,legal battle

Due to a number of issues and President Trump's approval rating here, Arizona looks like it's going to be going to the Democrats this time around because of a number of shifts. Ohio and Iowa voted for Trump by nearly 10% in 2016. They are still expected to narrow. And Joe Biden resonates with the rest of voters way better than Hillary Clinton.

Then again, by that day, a record number of Americans had already voted early, either in person or by mail. You see, for most of the year, the world was in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus hit the United States particularly hard, around 20% of all COVID-19-related deaths. And the world's happens in the United States, despite the country making up just over 4% of the world's population. By election day, it had killed around 235,000 Americans and many blamed President Donald Trump. Compared to other world leaders, Trump was slow to respond to the pandemic and originally downplayed the severity of the virus. Not only that, the economy was doing worse than it had since the Great Depression. Businesses closed and suffered due to lockdowns after local politicians tried to slow the spread of the virus. On-employments got as high as almost 15%. Despite wages slowly ticking up in the previous three years, nearly half of all Americans still lived paycheck to paycheck, meaning when the economy crashed in 2020, they had no savings to get them by. Trump also became just the third president in American history to be impeached for abusive power and obstruction of Congress after he allegedly tried to get Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on Joe Biden's son to hurt Biden's election campaign. More on that in a bit. Well, the Senate's acquitted Trump with nearly every Republican voting to keep him in office. But it wasn't just the impeachment. Throughout all the turmoil of 2020, the Republican party consistently stood by President Trump. He had a loyal, coat-like following, as seen by his mini rallies with enthusiastic supporters. However, Trump also had lots of enemies throughout his presidency. The traditional news media attacked him. Don't worry, he attacked him right back.",subjective,presidential

Then again, by that day, a record number of Americans had already voted early, either in person or by mail. You see, for most of the year, the world was in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus hit the United States particularly hard, around 20% of all COVID-19-related deaths. And the world's happens in the United States, despite the country making up just over 4% of the world's population. By election day, it had killed around 235,000 Americans and many blamed President Donald Trump. Compared to other world leaders, Trump was slow to respond to the pandemic and originally downplayed the severity of the virus. Not only that, the economy was doing worse than it had since the Great Depression. Businesses closed and suffered due to lockdowns after local politicians tried to slow the spread of the virus. On-employments got as high as almost 15%. Despite wages slowly ticking up in the previous three years, nearly half of all Americans still lived paycheck to paycheck, meaning when the economy crashed in 2020, they had no savings to get them by. Trump also became just the third president in American history to be impeached for abusive power and obstruction of Congress after he allegedly tried to get Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on Joe Biden's son to hurt Biden's election campaign. More on that in a bit. Well, the Senate's acquitted Trump with nearly every Republican voting to keep him in office. But it wasn't just the impeachment. Throughout all the turmoil of 2020, the Republican party consistently stood by President Trump. He had a loyal, coat-like following, as seen by his mini rallies with enthusiastic supporters. However, Trump also had lots of enemies throughout his presidency. The traditional news media attacked him. Don't worry, he attacked him right back.",subjective,presidential

My name is Jacob Angelichansley and I would like to start this official statement by thanking God Almighty for protection and blessings along this arduous journey of mine. You know, I once heard that school teaches us lessons and gives us a test, but God gives us a test and teaches us lessons. And to say the least, I have most certainly learned numerous lessons during the test which God has graced me with over the last two and a half years. Now, one of the most important lessons I learned is patience. See, the world is currently going through turmoil, the lives of which many of us were not prepared for by our schools, by our governments and our cultural upbringing. However, patience is key if we are to overcome the obstacles before us and simultaneously turn them into opportunities for unity, love and peace. Now, if handled with patience and understanding, we can use these demoralizing and destabilizing crisis to emerge a more evolved and stable and moral nation species. Another important lesson I've learned along the way is the power of peace and how having an unshakable internal peace is by far the most powerful tool that we have at our immediate disposal. For you see, power, power is not about the use of external force. Instead, power is derived from having an indomitable will. If we as individuals and as nations learn to use the power of peace to resolve our conflicts, our lives and the world will take the shape of a beautiful work of art molded by gods on hand. Now, another lesson I learned I'd like to share is the strength won gains when one practices forgiveness. Now, there are many, many people who would be outraged if what happened to me had happened to them. However, outrage and anger only cloud our judgment and prevent us from seeing the very real solutions which stare us in the face. See, forgiveness alone has the potential to clarify one's thinking, to unlock one's creativity and to enable the individual to heal. Christ understood the power of forgiveness to free a person's soul, which I think is why he forgave those nailing him to the cross. So in the spirit of Christ's amc, I would like to use this official statement to make it extremely clear that I have no animosity or hatred toward the United States federal government. And I have forgiven my captors and I pray for them because that is what Christ will do. The final lesson I will share is the power that we each wield when we live by and speak the truth. See, speaking the truth can topple corrupt empires and free whole nations that have been enslaved by illusions. The Buddha once said that three things cannot be hidden long. One, moon, truth. And while there are those who will say that things in the world are only getting worse, I, a sir, things are not getting worse, but rather the truth of global corruption is simply becoming more obvious. Therefore, I encourage all those who are watching this video and hearing these words to use the truth as a tool to shape themselves in the world into a paradise that we can pass on to our children. So in summation, the pressures brought about by my journey and my ordeal have only strengthened my resolve and taught me the power that we all possess when we practice patience and forgiveness and when we find internal peace and live by the truth so that we may speak the truth without fear. Therefore, the next part of my journey entails using the power of patience and peace to spread the truth and to do so in the spirit of a Christ-like forgiveness. In closing, Gandhi once said, first they ignore you and they laugh at you and they fight you then you win. So it seems I've already undergone the first three stages of this process. Now all there's left to do is win. Remember, knowledge always overcomes power.",subjective,faith

My name is Jacob Angelichancle and I would like to start this official statement by thanking God Almighty for protection and blessings along this arduous journey of mine. You know, I once heard that school teaches us lessons and gives us the tests, but God gives us the tests and teaches us lessons. And to say the least, I most certainly learned numerous lessons during the test which God has graced me with over the last two and a half years. Now one of the most important lessons I learned was patience. See, the world is currently going through turmoil, the lives of which many of us were not prepared for by our schools, by our governments and our cultural upbringing. However, patience is key if we are to overcome the obstacles before us and simultaneously turn them into opportunities for unity, love and peace. Now if handled with patience and understanding, we can use these demoralizing and destabilizing crisis to emerge a more evolved and a stable and moral nation species. Another important lesson I've learned along the way is the power of peace and how having an unshakable internal peace is by far the most powerful tool that we have at our immediate disposal. For you see, power is not about the use of external force. Instead, power is derived from having an indomitable will. If we as individuals and as nations learn to use the power of peace to resolve our conflicts, our lives and the world will take the shape of a beautiful work of art molded by God's own hand. Now another lesson I learned I'd like to share is the strength won gains when one practices forgiveness. Now there are many, many people who would be outraged if what happened to me had happened to them. However, outrage and anger only cloud our judgment and prevent us from seeing the very real solutions which scare us in the face. See, forgiveness alone has the potential to clarify one's thinking to unlock one's creativity and to enable the individual to heal. Christ understood the power of forgiveness to free a person's soul which I think is why he forgave those nailing him to the cross. So, in the spirit of Christ's example, I would like to use this official statement to make it extremely clear that I have no animosity or hatred toward the United States federal government. And I have forgiven my captors and I prayed for them because that is what Christ would do. The final lesson I will share is the power that we each wield when we live by and speak the truth. See, speaking the truth can topple corrupt empires and free whole nations that have been enslaved by illusions. The Buddha once said that three things cannot be hidden long. The Sun, the Moon, and the Truth. And while there are those who will say that things in the world are only getting worse, I assert things are not getting worse. But rather, the truth of global corruption is simply becoming more obvious. Therefore, I encourage all those who are watching this video and hearing these words to use the truth as a tool to shape themselves in the world into a paradise that we can pass on to our children. So, in summation, the pressures brought about by my journey and my ordeal have only strengthened my resolve and taught me the power that we all possess when we practice patience and forgiveness and when we find internal peace and live by the truth so that we may speak the truth without fear. Therefore, the next part of my journey entails using the power of patience and peace to spread the truth and to do so in the spirit of a Christ-like forgiveness. In closing, God once said, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win. So, it seems I've already undergone the first three stages of this process. Now, all there's left to do is win. Remember, knowledge always overcomes power.",subjective,lessons learned

My name is Jacob Angelichansley and I would like to start this official statement by thanking God Almighty for protection and blessings along this arduous journey of mine. You know, I once heard that school teaches us lessons and gives us a test, but God gives us a test and teaches us lessons. And to say the least, I have most certainly learned numerous lessons during the test which God has graced me with over the last two and a half years. Now, one of the most important lessons I learned is patience. See, the world is currently going through turmoil, the lives of which many of us were not prepared for by our schools, by our governments and our cultural upbringing. However, patience is key if we are to overcome the obstacles before us and simultaneously turn them into opportunities for unity, love and peace. Now, if handled with patience and understanding, we can use these demoralizing and destabilizing crisis to emerge a more evolved and stable and moral nation species. Another important lesson I've learned along the way is the power of peace and how having an unshakable internal peace is by far the most powerful tool that we have at our immediate disposal. For you see, power, power is not about the use of external force. Instead, power is derived from having an indomitable will. If we as individuals and as nations learn to use the power of peace to resolve our conflicts, our lives and the world will take the shape of a beautiful work of art molded by gods on hand. Now, another lesson I learned I'd like to share is the strength won gains when one practices forgiveness. Now, there are many, many people who would be outraged if what happened to me had happened to them. However, outrage and anger only cloud our judgment and prevent us from seeing the very real solutions which stare us in the face. See, forgiveness alone has the potential to clarify one's thinking, to unlock one's creativity and to enable the individual to heal. Christ understood the power of forgiveness to free a person's soul, which I think is why he forgave those nailing him to the cross. So in the spirit of Christ's amc, I would like to use this official statement to make it extremely clear that I have no animosity or hatred toward the United States federal government. And I have forgiven my captors and I pray for them because that is what Christ will do. The final lesson I will share is the power that we each wield when we live by and speak the truth. See, speaking the truth can topple corrupt empires and free whole nations that have been enslaved by illusions. The Buddha once said that three things cannot be hidden long. One, moon, truth. And while there are those who will say that things in the world are only getting worse, I, a sir, things are not getting worse, but rather the truth of global corruption is simply becoming more obvious. Therefore, I encourage all those who are watching this video and hearing these words to use the truth as a tool to shape themselves in the world into a paradise that we can pass on to our children. So in summation, the pressures brought about by my journey and my ordeal have only strengthened my resolve and taught me the power that we all possess when we practice patience and forgiveness and when we find internal peace and live by the truth so that we may speak the truth without fear. Therefore, the next part of my journey entails using the power of patience and peace to spread the truth and to do so in the spirit of a Christ-like forgiveness. In closing, Gandhi once said, first they ignore you and they laugh at you and they fight you then you win. So it seems I've already undergone the first three stages of this process. Now all there's left to do is win. Remember, knowledge always overcomes power.",subjective,faith

Forgiveness alone has the potential to clarify one‚Äôs thinking, unlock our creativity and enable the individual to heal.  #americasshaman #freejacobchansley #freejake ",False,,thematrixreport,theMatrixReport,,,,,,False,"Chansley, Jacob Anthony (Jake Angeli)",2021,@thematrixreport_video_7237230406511217962.txt," Hello United States of America and the world. My name is Jacob Angelichansley and I would like to start this official statement by thanking God Almighty for protection and blessings along this arduous journey of mine. You know, I once heard that school teaches us lessons and gives us a test, but God gives us a test and teaches us lessons. And to say the least, I have most certainly learned numerous lessons during the test which God has graced me with over the last two and a half years. Now, one of the most important lessons I learned is patience. See, the world is currently going through turmoil, the lives of which many of us were not prepared for by our schools, by our governments and our cultural upbringing. However, patience is key if we are to overcome the obstacles before us and simultaneously turn them into opportunities for unity, love and peace. Now, if handled with patience and understanding, we can use these demoralizing and destabilizing crisis to emerge a more evolved and stable and moral nation species. Another important lesson I've learned along the way is the power of peace and how having an unshakable internal peace is by far the most powerful tool that we have at our immediate disposal. For you see, power, power is not about the use of external force. Instead, power is derived from having an indomitable will. If we as individuals and as nations learn to use the power of peace to resolve our conflicts, our lives and the world will take the shape of a beautiful work of art molded by gods on hand. Now, another lesson I learned I'd like to share is the strength won gains when one practices forgiveness. Now, there are many, many people who would be outraged if what happened to me had happened to them. However, outrage and anger only cloud our judgment and prevent us from seeing the very real solutions which stare us in the face. See, forgiveness alone has the potential to clarify one's thinking, to unlock one's creativity and to enable the individual to heal. Christ understood the power of forgiveness to free a person's soul, which I think is why he forgave those nailing him to the cross. So in the spirit of Christ's amc, I would like to use this official statement to make it extremely clear that I have no animosity or hatred toward the United States federal government. And I have forgiven my captors and I pray for them because that is what Christ will do. The final lesson I will share is the power that we each wield when we live by and speak the truth. See, speaking the truth can topple corrupt empires and free whole nations that have been enslaved by illusions. The Buddha once said that three things cannot be hidden long. One, moon, truth. And while there are those who will say that things in the world are only getting worse, I, a sir, things are not getting worse, but rather the truth of global corruption is simply becoming more obvious. Therefore, I encourage all those who are watching this video and hearing these words to use the truth as a tool to shape themselves in the world into a paradise that we can pass on to our children. So in summation, the pressures brought about by my journey and my ordeal have only strengthened my resolve and taught me the power that we all possess when we practice patience and forgiveness and when we find internal peace and live by the truth so that we may speak the truth without fear. Therefore, the next part of my journey entails using the power of patience and peace to spread the truth and to do so in the spirit of a Christ-like forgiveness. In closing, Gandhi once said, first they ignore you and they laugh at you and they fight you then you win. So it seems I've already undergone the first three stages of this process. Now all there's left to do is win. Remember, knowledge always overcomes power.",subjective,not english

As I watched this hearing, I noted the difference in questioning by certain committee members, so I decided to do a little bit of digging, and what I found was rather interesting, especially as it relates to citizens united and political donations by corporations. In 2020, TransDiam donated $226,153 to Republican campaigns, but only donated $39,938 to Democratic campaigns. Their highest individual candidate campaign donations were $2, Martha McSally, $30,400, Tom Tillis, $23,500, David Perdue, $21,800, Johnny Onesd, $19,320, Kelly Lafler, $19,600, $1,000, all of these members of Congress, will or are current members of the Military Affairs Committee with the exception of Kelly Lafler. You remember Kelly Lafler, right? The Republican Georgia Senator who was suspected of insider trading after selling off stocks of companies that would have been susceptible to the COVID pandemic after she attended a briefing about COVID at the beginning of the pandemic. Well, wouldn't you know it? Mrs. Lafler and her husband own stock in TransDiam at the same time that she was a sitting member of Congress. There needs to be serious campaign reforms for both donations by corporations and stock clothing by members of Congress on both sides of the political fence. Members of Congress no longer work for the people. They are bat by and work for corporations. As far as TransDiam is concerned, the federal government has requested that the company refund a little over $20 million. This is the second time in three years that they've been asked to refund money to the federal government for overcharging. In 2019, they refunded $16 million.

They're part of an ongoing investigation into the misinformation spread by the fossil fuel industry and this might be the biggest proof of their deliberate prevention of action on climate change yet. They didn't act alone either. Public relations firm Brunswick Group developed an advocacy plan for gas and methane. The campaign is right here and the goal is clear to risk the lives of all of us by advancing and protecting the will of gas and BP in the future of the energy conversation. Huge PR campaigns from major players like Shell focus entirely on clean energy development which don't really exist. Exxon plans only invest 10 to 12.5% of capital investments in lower carbon initiatives. Chevron is only committing to reduce 5% beyond operational emissions by 2028. BP and Shell claim they're going net zero while only spending 17 and 10% respectively on alternative energy. All the rest of those billions of dollars going right towards the expansion and acceleration of more emissions that are warming and destroying the planet. All major oil and gas companies are investing more in fossil fuels and are making inadequate climate pledges as they break in record of multi-billion dollar profits. At the same time they're pursuing a strategy of resisting and blocking climate regulations and only plan to cut emissions if it makes commercial sense. As the cherry on top they fought aggressively to hide the truth by not complying with subpoenas and attacking any journalist who reveals the truth about them. Despite all the ads and apparent plans to pursue and develop renewable energy sources their lives can be summarized in these documents with this sentence. Experts have found that not one of the net zero pledges from BP and Shell, Exxon or Chevron are aligned with the pace and scope of cuts necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and avert catastrophic climate change. Despite the best efforts of big oil and the American petroleum institute we now know without a doubt that they have no intention of adequately switching to renewable energy in any time frame close to what's required to secure a livable future.",subjective,climate mis

I have four children and nine grandchildren. On the night of April the 2nd, 2016, my family got a phone call that would change our lives forever. My ex has been answered the phone and let out a blood curdling scream, a scream of pain from the depths of his soul. He screamed, he cried, he's gone, he is gone.

My ex has been answered the phone and let out a blood curdling scream, a scream of pain from the depths of his soul. He screamed, he cried, he's gone, he is gone. Our 19 year old son, Emmanuel, went to a party early that night. After we got the call, we was frantic. We called his phone, no one answered. We called even the police. I went to Facebook and I had to ask, is my son dead? I found out that he was shot point blank in the head and killed while playing dominoes. No one spoke up for weeks and the killer was on the run. No one was going to snitch, but that is the street life. Words can't describe how hard it is the very a child. I ate for anyone and all who have done the same. My son, deaf, was a result of a criminal with an evil heart and a justice system felon to hold him accountable for the laws he had already broken.

Well, those policies did not save my son. The laws being discussed are already implemented. In cities across this country, we have decades of evidence proven they do not work. St. Louis, New York, Chicago, Washington, Atlanta, our gun control utopias, and they are plagued with the most violence. Ten more laws, 20 more laws, 1,000 more won't make what has already illegal, more wrong, or stop criminals from committing these crimes. And y'all are delusional if you think it's going to keep us safe. I am a walking testimony of how the criminal justice system and the gun control laws, which estates in racism, by the way, have failed the black community.

There have been no hearings, there have been no classified briefings about documents at Mar-Lago. So the members of Congress who were saying what they know, what they're talking about are leaks into the news media, which by the way are illegal leaks that are coming either a from the Department of Justice or be from the FBI.

When we issue suspicious activity reports, it's not just thrown out like a mere bag of shells. It's done for specific reasons because there are concerns about criminalities surrounding the financial transaction. If Hunter Biden and other members of the Biden family have more than a 100 suspicious activity reports, Congress does need to know about this because a funny thing's happening at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Joe Biden is president of the United States, his son, who's not a kid, by the way, the man's 50 years old, he and a kid, okay. His son is running around the world, cutting deals. His son is involved involved in suspicious activity reports where financial institutions are making that readily have that actually drafted those documents. And Congress doesn't want to know. We don't want to have oversight now. I find it interesting. I think it's very clear that the members of the majority party do have a playbook when it comes to smearing up political opponents. They talked about several people, like Lois Lerner? Yeah. She was discriminating against Tea Party groups. That was a fact. Like Benghazi? Yes, there was a there was a military effects at the Department of State that led to the death of four members of four people at service, our country, and served our country. That did occur. And the one that we already know is occurring, not through conjecture, because the documents of the transactions are quite clear. Hunter Biden was readily involved in the transactions dealing with Chinese companies for a mineral that is critical to the Democrat agenda with respect to the Green New Deal.

He was very involved. The New York Times is reported on his level of involvement.

Now president of the United States had no idea that his son was engaged in the sale of a cold bought mine to a Chinese company at the same time when the centerpiece of Joe Biden's energy policy is electric cars in the United States and more green technology. I mean, come on, folks, that is just crazy. You can sit here and try to lecture us about the leaks at Mar-Lago, which by the way, let me also state for the record for the American people. There have been no hearings, there have been no classified briefings about documents at Mar-Lago. So the members of Congress who were saying what they know, what they're talking about are leaks into the news media, which by the way are illegal leaks that are coming either a from the Department of Justice or be from the FBI. We don't know because the press reflects their sources. But if you're citing that, that is illegal information obtained by the press with active investigations. Let's go back to Hunter Biden. The chairman is the the the ranking member is correct. There are changes by Joe Biden to the ability for Congress to get suspicious activity reports. I am a recovering banker. When we issue suspicious activity reports, it's not just thrown out like a mere bag of shells. It's done for specific reasons because there are concerns about criminalities surrounding the financial transaction. If Hunter Biden and other members of the Biden family have more than a 100 suspicious activity reports, Congress does need to know about this because a funny thing's happening at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Joe Biden is president of the United States, his son, who's not a kid, by the way, the man's 50 years old, he and a kid, okay. His son is running around the world, cutting deals. His son is involved involved in suspicious activity reports where financial institutions are making that readily have that actually drafted those documents. And Congress doesn't want to know. We don't want to have oversight now. I find it interesting. I think it's very clear that the members of the majority party do have a playbook when it comes to smearing up political opponents. They talked about several people, like Lois Lerner? Yeah. She was discriminating against Tea Party groups. That was a fact. Like Benghazi? Yes, there was a there was a military effects at the Department of State that led to the death of four members of four people at service, our country, and served our country. That did occur. And the one that we already know is occurring, not through conjecture, because the documents of the transactions are quite clear. Hunter Biden was readily involved in the transactions dealing with Chinese companies for a mineral that is critical to the Democrat agenda with respect to the Green New Deal.

There's a cost to letting insurers paperwork, patients, and providers to death. And that cost of inaction is $200 billion on administrative costs. Now, administrative costs waste money, but they also waste health care workers' time. A recent study found that a majority of doctors, 56%, support a single-payer health care program. Why? Because today, doctors spend only one quarter of their time with patients. What are they doing with the rest of their time? Paperwork. Medicare for all would save a many on administrative costs, $200 billion a year. Medicare for all would give patients the most choices, 99% of non-pediatric providers.

He was very involved. The New York Times is reported on his level of involvement. So do you mean to tell me that Joe Biden who was then was a former vice president of the United States, then candidate for the presidency of the United States? Now president of the United States had no idea that his son was engaged in the sale of a cold bought mine to a Chinese company at the same time when the centerpiece of Joe Biden's energy policy is electric cars in the United States and more green technology. I mean, come on, folks, that is just crazy. You can sit here and try to lecture us about the leaks at Mar-Lago, which by the way, let me also state for the record for the American people. There have been no hearings, there have been no classified briefings about documents at Mar-Lago. So the members of Congress who were saying what they know, what they're talking about are leaks into the news media, which by the way are illegal leaks that are coming either a from the Department of Justice or be from the FBI. We don't know because the press reflects their sources. But if you're citing that, that is illegal information obtained by the press with active investigations. Let's go back to Hunter Biden. The chairman is the the the ranking member is correct. There are changes by Joe Biden to the ability for Congress to get suspicious activity reports. I am a recovering banker. When we issue suspicious activity reports, it's not just thrown out like a mere bag of shells. It's done for specific reasons because there are concerns about criminalities surrounding the financial transaction. If Hunter Biden and other members of the Biden family have more than a 100 suspicious activity reports, Congress does need to know about this because a funny thing's happening at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Joe Biden is president of the United States, his son, who's not a kid, by the way, the man's 50 years old, he and a kid, okay. His son is running around the world, cutting deals. His son is involved involved in suspicious activity reports where financial institutions are making that readily have that actually drafted those documents. And Congress doesn't want to know. We don't want to have oversight now. I find it interesting. I think it's very clear that the members of the majority party do have a playbook when it comes to smearing up political opponents. They talked about several people, like Lois Lerner? Yeah. She was discriminating against Tea Party groups. That was a fact. Like Benghazi? Yes, there was a there was a military effects at the Department of State that led to the death of four members of four people at service, our country, and served our country. That did occur. And the one that we already know is occurring, not through conjecture, because the documents of the transactions are quite clear. Hunter Biden was readily involved in the transactions dealing with Chinese companies for a mineral that is critical to the Democrat agenda with respect to the Green New Deal. If Congress should not investigate what's going on between Hunter Biden and Joe Biden, then I don't even know what we're doing here, folks. We might as well just wait to the midterms over.

Private companies spend 17 times more on administrative costs than Medicare. What are private insurance companies spending on that Medicare is not? Does Medicare spend hundreds of millions of dollars on television advertisements like private insurance does? No. Does Medicare spend millions of dollars on stock buybacks to shareholders? No. Does Medicare spend money on marketing? Private insurance likes to put its name on stadiums and HGA tournaments. Is there a Medicare arena? No. Does Medicare spend $23 million on executive pay like private insurance companies do? No. We know how much it costs to run a high-quality health insurance program. $1. Out of $100, research shows that Medicare spends 1.1% on administrative costs. We spend $4 trillion on health care every year. We could save $200 billion on administrative costs with Medicare for all. And those savings, they could go to expand Medicare. There's a cost to letting insurers paperwork, patients, and providers to death. And that cost of inaction is $200 billion on administrative costs. Now, administrative costs waste money, but they also waste health care workers' time. A recent study found that a majority of doctors, 56%, support a single-payer health care program. Why? Because today, doctors spend only one quarter of their time with patients. What are they doing with the rest of their time? Paperwork. Medicare for all would save a many on administrative costs, $200 billion a year. Medicare for all would give patients the most choices, 99% of non-pediatric providers. And Medicare would let doctors practice medicine. Not surprisingly, given these three things, what do we get with Medicare for all? Better health outcomes. And that's why I support Medicare for all. Because I support patients over paperwork.",subjective,healthcare

As I watched this hearing, I noted the difference in questioning by certain committee members, so I decided to do a little bit of digging, and what I found was rather interesting, especially as it relates to citizens united and political donations by corporations. In 2020, TransDiam donated $226,153 to Republican campaigns, but only donated $39,938 to Democratic campaigns. Their highest individual candidate campaign donations were $2, Martha McSally, $30,400, Tom Tillis, $23,500, David Perdue, $21,800, Johnny Onesd, $19,320, Kelly Lafler, $19,600, $1,000, all of these members of Congress, will or are current members of the Military Affairs Committee with the exception of Kelly Lafler. You remember Kelly Lafler, right? The Republican Georgia Senator who was suspected of insider trading after selling off stocks of companies that would have been susceptible to the COVID pandemic after she attended a briefing about COVID at the beginning of the pandemic. Well, wouldn't you know it? Mrs. Lafler and her husband own stock in TransDiam at the same time that she was a sitting member of Congress. There needs to be serious campaign reforms for both donations by corporations and stock clothing by members of Congress on both sides of the political fence. Members of Congress no longer work for the people. They are bat by and work for corporations. As far as TransDiam is concerned, the federal government has requested that the company refund a little over $20 million. This is the second time in three years that they've been asked to refund money to the federal government for overcharging. In 2019, they refunded $16 million.

Since the horrific terrorist attacks committed by Hamas against innocent people in Israel a few weeks ago, we've been working around the clock to support our partners there and to protect Americans here at home. We assess that the actions of Hamas and its allies will serve as an inspiration the likes of which we haven't seen since ISIS launched its so-called caliphate several years ago. In just the past few weeks, multiple foreign terrorist organizations have called for attacks against Americans and the West. Al-Qaeda issued its most specific call to attack the United States in the last five years. ISIS urged its followers to target Jewish communities in the United States and Europe. Hezbollah has publicly expressed its support for Hamas and threatened to attack U.S. interests in the Middle East. And we've seen an increase in attacks on U.S. military bases overseas carried out by militia groups backed by Iran. Here in the United States, our most immediate concern is that violent extremists, individuals or small groups will draw inspiration from the events in the Middle East to carry out attacks against Americans going about their daily lives. That includes not just homegrown violent extremists inspired by a foreign terrorist organization, but also domestic violent extremists targeting Jewish or Muslim communities. We've already seen that with the individual we arrested last week in Houston who'd been studying how to build bombs and posted online about his support for killing Jews. And with the tragic killing of a six-year-old Muslim boy in Illinois and what we're investigating is a federal hate crime. But as I said a few moments ago, on top of the homegrown violent extremists and domestic violent extremists threat, we also cannot and do not discount the possibility that Hamas or another foreign terrorist organization may exploit the current conflict to conduct attacks here on our own soil. We have kept our sights on Hamas and have multiple ongoing investigations into individuals affiliated with that foreign terrorist organization. And while historically our Hamas cases have identified individuals located here who are facilitating and financing Hamas' terrorism overseas, we're continuing to scrutinize our intelligence to assess how the threat may be evolving. But it's not just Hamas. As the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, the Iranians, for instance, have directly, or by hiring criminals, mounted assassination attempts against dissidents and high-ranking current and former U.S. government officials, including right here on American soil.",subjective,terror

So, in response, the Justice Department is considering the expansion of a program that allows early releases to inmate to our victims of sexual abuse behind bars. It's basically a compassionate release program. When this subcommittee did this investigation several women testified before the committee to accompany the release of this report. That report was not based just on their testimony, but it was based on numerous interviews with current and former prison officials, whistleblowers, and survivors of sexual abuse while incarcerated. The summary of the report essentially finds that the Bureau of Prisons has failed to successfully implement the Prison Rape Elimination Act. One victim testifying at that subcommittee hearing, I was going to give a trigger warning before I go into this. She testified, I was sentenced to put in prison for choices that I made. I was not sent to prison to be raped and abused. That victim was incarcerated at the facility in West Virginia where she was repeatedly assaulted by an officer working there and then was met with threats to block a transfer to a facility that was closer to her family if she resisted the assaults. Female inmates were sexually abused in 19 of the 29 federal facilities that housed female inmates and have housed them over the last 10 years. And in at least four, if not more of those federal facilities, managers failed to enforce the federal law that exists to reduce sexual assault in prisons. The report also revealed that hundreds of sexual abuse and assault charges are among the backlog of more than 8,000 internal affairs misconduct cases waiting to be investigated. Subcommittee leaders stated our findings are deeply disturbing and demonstrate that the BOP Bureau of Prisons is failing systemically to prevent detect and address sexual abuse of prisoners by its own employees. The BOP has a new director Colette S. Peters and she stated that she's begun to consider requests from inmates who are victims of sexual abuse and are not considered to be a threat if they are released. However, advocates feel that considering those cases is not enough and they are pushing the United States Sentencing Commission to give inmates the right to directly request a compassionate release ruling from trial judges instead of having to go through the Bureau.",subjective,prison

Thank you Mr. Ranking member. As I understand it the function before the archivist of the United States is what has been described as ministerial in function so the archivist is publishes an amendment when it is part of the Constitution not the decider. Very good and I think that's exactly right in some ways would probably be similar to sort of the certification of an election you know when the vice president comes in it's thought to be ministerial not that the vice president had the power to change or alter the election. Will you allow security at the archives to force people to cover clothing that has political speech on it? Thank you Mr. Ranking member for that question absolutely not. Will you get to the bottom of how it happened to make sure that we don't have people I don't know if this was some a rogue person out there doing this or if the previous those in charge were encouraging this but we promised to get to the bottom of it. Absolutely Mr. Ranking member. I think one of the things American people hate most about government is when it appears as if justice or the adjudication of justice is partial you know when you know Lady Liberty's not blind Lady Justice is not blind that there are different standards for people depending on their party and at least from where I said a lot of Republicans felt like there was a different standard you know and it'd be really in the way the FBI treated Donald Trump and Joe Biden. The bigger problem though I think is that everything is classified we just we classify everything the menu at the White House is supposedly classified I mean we've got problems with too much classification but it also makes oversight difficult so for example a million Americans died from COVID somewhere between 12 15 maybe 18 million people died worldwide from COVID and I can't get records from the NIH because they classify more they send them to the NIH I think it was HHS and is a 250 page document and redacted the whole thing.

The 105-page report titled Planned In Plane Site expands on what we already knew and gives some new examples of warnings, information, and red flags that were missed in the weeks leading up to the violence that disrupts the U.S. Congressional certification of the 2020 election. The report also found multiple federal agencies failed to effectively coordinate the lead up to January 6th. The report basically says Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and FBI were replicating the Spider-Man meme, pointing the fingers at each other with no one taking responsibility for being the lead agency. The report says the problem with the intelligence agencies wasn't that they didn't collect the information that indicated the potential of violence was coming. The problem was the FBI and Homeland Security failed to fully and accurately assess the severity of those threats and failed to formally disseminate the threat warnings to law enforcement partners with the proper level of urgency and alarm. So what are they going to do about it?

We're not getting cooperation from your agency. And then I gave them a couple examples. There's two areas that the American public can get information out of the government. One is FOIA requests. And unfortunately, that often has to go through a court and have that be court ordered, although it shouldn't be. And then through congressional oversight, right? So I have two examples of both. This was a document. These are the famous anti-fouche emails. OK. Through a FOIA request, people got them early. And what we did is, shortly after, we had five members of this committee. There's actually a law. Five USC 2954 that says, if five members of this committee request information, the government shall provide it. So under that statute, we wrote the letter, we got this document. OK. This is dated February 4th. The classification here is the exception 4, is why it's redacted. And that has to do with trade secrets or confidential, commercial, or financial information. This is the same document recently produced under FOIA to the general public. It's not redacted. So now I know what's under the redactions. Cereo passage in ACE2 transgenic mice. But that's what was covered up. This is Anthony Fauci with question marks going. This is in February 4th. He's already recognized that maybe the claim from a lab, from experiments with those humanized mice. That was denied Congress in our oversight capability. A couple days earlier, similar type of thing. This is what we got in congressional oversight, all redacted. This is what was obtained under FOIA request. So again, we can see under the redactions now. And again, not because the agency gave it to us, because the court ordered it. It's interesting. This is classified under exception number five, which is deliberative process, inter or intraagency communications. What's interesting about this email chain, it includes Jeremy Ferraro of the welcome trust. He doesn't work for US government agencies. So you've already blown the privilege in terms of confidentiality. So again, they're not following the law. Through the accommodation process, we ask for all 4,000 pages. We narrowed it down to 400. They wouldn't give them to us. They allowed us to read it in a reading room. We could take notes, no copies. Over the course of a year, up until about January 2022, we got 350 of the 400 pages requested. Since January 2022, we've been fighting tooth and nail for the last 50 pages. This is what the FOIA request got. This is what it looks like. OK. There's obviously some important information in this last 50 pages. And we can't get it. They are flagrantly not complying with the laws. But there's no enforcement mechanism. They know that. The administration knows that. So this problem just gets worse. What kind of enforcement mechanism can we have for Congress to reclaim its oversight authority? So respectfully. And I do mean this respectfully. You do have a tool. And I'd be willing to bet that a certain gentleman from Ohio, who happens to be heading up a specific subcommittee or committee in the House of Representatives, would probably be willing to work with you to begin to incentivize bureaucrats within the executive branch to follow the law.",subjective,government oversight

Since the horrific terrorist attacks committed by Hamas against innocent people in Israel a few weeks ago, we've been working around the clock to support our partners there and to protect Americans here at home. We assess that the actions of Hamas and its allies will serve as an inspiration the likes of which we haven't seen since ISIS launched its so-called caliphate several years ago. In just the past few weeks, multiple foreign terrorist organizations have called for attacks against Americans and the West. Al-Qaeda issued its most specific call to attack the United States in the last five years. ISIS urged its followers to target Jewish communities in the United States and Europe. Hezbollah has publicly expressed its support for Hamas and threatened to attack U.S. interests in the Middle East. And we've seen an increase in attacks on U.S. military bases overseas carried out by militia groups backed by Iran. Here in the United States, our most immediate concern is that violent extremists, individuals or small groups will draw inspiration from the events in the Middle East to carry out attacks against Americans going about their daily lives. That includes not just homegrown violent extremists inspired by a foreign terrorist organization, but also domestic violent extremists targeting Jewish or Muslim communities. We've already seen that with the individual we arrested last week in Houston who'd been studying how to build bombs and posted online about his support for killing Jews. And with the tragic killing of a six-year-old Muslim boy in Illinois and what we're investigating is a federal hate crime. But as I said a few moments ago, on top of the homegrown violent extremists and domestic violent extremists threat, we also cannot and do not discount the possibility that Hamas or another foreign terrorist organization may exploit the current conflict to conduct attacks here on our own soil. We have kept our sights on Hamas and have multiple ongoing investigations into individuals affiliated with that foreign terrorist organization. And while historically our Hamas cases have identified individuals located here who are facilitating and financing Hamas' terrorism overseas, we're continuing to scrutinize our intelligence to assess how the threat may be evolving. But it's not just Hamas. As the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, the Iranians, for instance, have directly, or by hiring criminals, mounted assassination attempts against dissidents and high-ranking current and former U.S. government officials, including right here on American soil.",subjective,terror

So, in response, the Justice Department is considering the expansion of a program that allows early releases to inmate to our victims of sexual abuse behind bars. It's basically a compassionate release program. When this subcommittee did this investigation several women testified before the committee to accompany the release of this report. That report was not based just on their testimony, but it was based on numerous interviews with current and former prison officials, whistleblowers, and survivors of sexual abuse while incarcerated. The summary of the report essentially finds that the Bureau of Prisons has failed to successfully implement the Prison Rape Elimination Act. One victim testifying at that subcommittee hearing, I was going to give a trigger warning before I go into this. She testified, I was sentenced to put in prison for choices that I made. I was not sent to prison to be raped and abused. That victim was incarcerated at the facility in West Virginia where she was repeatedly assaulted by an officer working there and then was met with threats to block a transfer to a facility that was closer to her family if she resisted the assaults. Female inmates were sexually abused in 19 of the 29 federal facilities that housed female inmates and have housed them over the last 10 years. And in at least four, if not more of those federal facilities, managers failed to enforce the federal law that exists to reduce sexual assault in prisons. The report also revealed that hundreds of sexual abuse and assault charges are among the backlog of more than 8,000 internal affairs misconduct cases waiting to be investigated. Subcommittee leaders stated our findings are deeply disturbing and demonstrate that the BOP Bureau of Prisons is failing systemically to prevent detect and address sexual abuse of prisoners by its own employees. The BOP has a new director Colette S. Peters and she stated that she's begun to consider requests from inmates who are victims of sexual abuse and are not considered to be a threat if they are released. However, advocates feel that considering those cases is not enough and they are pushing the United States Sentencing Commission to give inmates the right to directly request a compassionate release ruling from trial judges instead of having to go through the Bureau.",subjective,prison

Since the horrific terrorist attacks committed by Hamas against innocent people in Israel a few weeks ago, we've been working around the clock to support our partners there and to protect Americans here at home. We assess that the actions of Hamas and its allies will serve as an inspiration the likes of which we haven't seen since ISIS launched its so-called caliphate several years ago. In just the past few weeks, multiple foreign terrorist organizations have called for attacks against Americans and the West. Al-Qaeda issued its most specific call to attack the United States in the last five years. ISIS urged its followers to target Jewish communities in the United States and Europe. Hezbollah has publicly expressed its support for Hamas and threatened to attack U.S. interests in the Middle East. And we've seen an increase in attacks on U.S. military bases overseas carried out by militia groups backed by Iran. Here in the United States, our most immediate concern is that violent extremists, individuals or small groups will draw inspiration from the events in the Middle East to carry out attacks against Americans going about their daily lives. That includes not just homegrown violent extremists inspired by a foreign terrorist organization, but also domestic violent extremists targeting Jewish or Muslim communities. We've already seen that with the individual we arrested last week in Houston who'd been studying how to build bombs and posted online about his support for killing Jews. And with the tragic killing of a six-year-old Muslim boy in Illinois and what we're investigating is a federal hate crime. But as I said a few moments ago, on top of the homegrown violent extremists and domestic violent extremists threat, we also cannot and do not discount the possibility that Hamas or another foreign terrorist organization may exploit the current conflict to conduct attacks here on our own soil. We have kept our sights on Hamas and have multiple ongoing investigations into individuals affiliated with that foreign terrorist organization. And while historically our Hamas cases have identified individuals located here who are facilitating and financing Hamas' terrorism overseas, we're continuing to scrutinize our intelligence to assess how the threat may be evolving. But it's not just Hamas. As the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, the Iranians, for instance, have directly, or by hiring criminals, mounted assassination attempts against dissidents and high-ranking current and former U.S. government officials, including right here on American soil.",subjective,terror

So, in response, the Justice Department is considering the expansion of a program that allows early releases to inmate to our victims of sexual abuse behind bars. It's basically a compassionate release program. When this subcommittee did this investigation several women testified before the committee to accompany the release of this report. That report was not based just on their testimony, but it was based on numerous interviews with current and former prison officials, whistleblowers, and survivors of sexual abuse while incarcerated. The summary of the report essentially finds that the Bureau of Prisons has failed to successfully implement the Prison Rape Elimination Act. One victim testifying at that subcommittee hearing, I was going to give a trigger warning before I go into this. She testified, I was sentenced to put in prison for choices that I made. I was not sent to prison to be raped and abused. That victim was incarcerated at the facility in West Virginia where she was repeatedly assaulted by an officer working there and then was met with threats to block a transfer to a facility that was closer to her family if she resisted the assaults. Female inmates were sexually abused in 19 of the 29 federal facilities that housed female inmates and have housed them over the last 10 years. And in at least four, if not more of those federal facilities, managers failed to enforce the federal law that exists to reduce sexual assault in prisons. The report also revealed that hundreds of sexual abuse and assault charges are among the backlog of more than 8,000 internal affairs misconduct cases waiting to be investigated. Subcommittee leaders stated our findings are deeply disturbing and demonstrate that the BOP Bureau of Prisons is failing systemically to prevent detect and address sexual abuse of prisoners by its own employees. The BOP has a new director Colette S. Peters and she stated that she's begun to consider requests from inmates who are victims of sexual abuse and are not considered to be a threat if they are released. However, advocates feel that considering those cases is not enough and they are pushing the United States Sentencing Commission to give inmates the right to directly request a compassionate release ruling from trial judges instead of having to go through the Bureau.",subjective,prison

Thank you Mr. Ranking member. As I understand it the function before the archivist of the United States is what has been described as ministerial in function so the archivist is publishes an amendment when it is part of the Constitution not the decider. Very good and I think that's exactly right in some ways would probably be similar to sort of the certification of an election you know when the vice president comes in it's thought to be ministerial not that the vice president had the power to change or alter the election. Will you allow security at the archives to force people to cover clothing that has political speech on it? Thank you Mr. Ranking member for that question absolutely not. Will you get to the bottom of how it happened to make sure that we don't have people I don't know if this was some a rogue person out there doing this or if the previous those in charge were encouraging this but we promised to get to the bottom of it. Absolutely Mr. Ranking member. I think one of the things American people hate most about government is when it appears as if justice or the adjudication of justice is partial you know when you know Lady Liberty's not blind Lady Justice is not blind that there are different standards for people depending on their party and at least from where I said a lot of Republicans felt like there was a different standard you know and it'd be really in the way the FBI treated Donald Trump and Joe Biden. The bigger problem though I think is that everything is classified we just we classify everything the menu at the White House is supposedly classified I mean we've got problems with too much classification but it also makes oversight difficult so for example a million Americans died from COVID somewhere between 12 15 maybe 18 million people died worldwide from COVID and I can't get records from the NIH because they classify more they send them to the NIH I think it was HHS and is a 250 page document and redacted the whole thing. This is just sort of an insult and you know how we get to it you don't have complete control of this but I think you have some control over the older records how do you understand your role on the older records with being part of declassifying older records. Thank you for that question yes as I understand it the agency that classifies information has the responsibility for and the choice to declassify that information but there is the National Declassification Center at the National Archives located in Maryland and if I am confirmed I plan to of course visit the National Declassification Center and also prioritize as you said Mr. Making member the older records they're waiting for declassification figuring out how we can be most efficient in doing this and how we can strengthen relationships with those classifying agencies those classifying entities so that we are able to move some of these older documents through the process I agree with that and really just for the record here on the presidential you know controversy what we're stuck with now is you know millions of dollars will be spent on these investigations and there should be an investigation of neither Biden nor Trump nor Pence on this they should be told you know what these are rules and we should try to work with people that were in office I think we're not going to find that the secrets to making you know a nuclear weapon we're at someone's house I think we're going to find that a lot of stuff's classified that doesn't need to be classified but it began with sort of a witch hunt for Trump everybody loved it they love you know the media cackled and rubbed their hands together and it went on for weeks and weeks they had Donald Trump they were going to get him they're going to put him in jail like all the rest of the governments you know they're controlled by one party around the country they just had glee until Biden was found to have records in much less secure place next to his you know Corvette and his garage but I think we've overreacted to both and I've talked with a chairman and others on the other side that we need to do something about this this overclassification problem and what little part you can be of it and I realize and don't want you to create ball but what you can do on the older records I think we would appreciate trying to get less and I look forward to working with the chairman I'm trying to to change this because we can't have true oversight of government if HHS and NIH is telling us you know it's none of your business I mean we really have to get a hold of what's going on and to be the covid thing isn't about isn't about Biden at all a lot of this happened in the previous administration so really it shouldn't be partisan at all we should all want to find these records I'm going to reserve my time for later if that's okay that's fine,subjective,constitution

Earlier this month, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the federal agencies, including the FBI and DHS, likely violated the First Amendment. In fact, the judge said it was one of the worst, if not the worst, violation of the First Amendment in the history in our American history. Our federal government is still undertaking many of the same tactics to be unworthy of democracy, and occasionally reminiscent of totalitarian regimes. Today, it was revealed on Capitol Hill and news you aren't supposed to know that, indeed, we are being censored, and our freedom of speech has been violated countless times. The FBI continues to misuse its authority under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Survey Lens Act. You would think we'd be going after foreigners, but we are using the Foreign Intelligence Survey Lens Act to go after Americans. It's also revealed that, as we suspected, the government has an approved message, even when that message is false. You are to know. And if anything differs from that government-approved message, even if it's untrue, it could be taken down and countless were investigated illegally. We're targeted and surveilled for contradicting the approved government initiative. And narrative. Think we're safe from creeping dictatorship or to totalitarianism? We'll think again. Worsing social media companies to remove speech, the government disagreed with FBI and DHS, regularly met with social media companies and pressured them to remove content, it deemed as misinformation, including posts and accounts that originated from within the United States, and including posts and accounts that are verifiably true. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that federal agencies, including the FBI, have likely trampled on the First Amendment. The judge general back either calling it potentially the most severe First Amendment violation and US history. The scariest part is that there is no checks and balances because the government has no incentive to do anything because they are the ones who want your narrative to be controlled. Intelligence agencies use their powers to serve ideological purposes attempting to covertly influence social policy and political action. Senator Rand Paul pulls the veil of a dark troop. The government distorted and exaggerated facts, leveraged mass media and attacked the leadership of groups it considered to be threats to the social order. And a recent investigation has uncovered decades of abuse by federal intelligence agencies against ordinary Americans. Even groups like the NAACP to women's liberation groups, anyone opposing the government's approved narrative faced surveillance and intimidation. Revealing decades of widespread abuse by federal intelligence agencies against US citizens. It's chilling. The government has scripted message in anyone that deviates from it, even with the truth, is silenced. And the censorship of the Constitution, a constitutionally protected speech on social media, is just one example of actions in recent years weaponizing the federal government against its people.

So, in response, the Justice Department is considering the expansion of a program that allows early releases to inmate to our victims of sexual abuse behind bars. It's basically a compassionate release program. When this subcommittee did this investigation several women testified before the committee to accompany the release of this report. That report was not based just on their testimony, but it was based on numerous interviews with current and former prison officials, whistleblowers, and survivors of sexual abuse while incarcerated. The summary of the report essentially finds that the Bureau of Prisons has failed to successfully implement the Prison Rape Elimination Act. One victim testifying at that subcommittee hearing, I was going to give a trigger warning before I go into this. She testified, I was sentenced to put in prison for choices that I made. I was not sent to prison to be raped and abused. That victim was incarcerated at the facility in West Virginia where she was repeatedly assaulted by an officer working there and then was met with threats to block a transfer to a facility that was closer to her family if she resisted the assaults. Female inmates were sexually abused in 19 of the 29 federal facilities that housed female inmates and have housed them over the last 10 years. And in at least four, if not more of those federal facilities, managers failed to enforce the federal law that exists to reduce sexual assault in prisons. The report also revealed that hundreds of sexual abuse and assault charges are among the backlog of more than 8,000 internal affairs misconduct cases waiting to be investigated. Subcommittee leaders stated our findings are deeply disturbing and demonstrate that the BOP Bureau of Prisons is failing systemically to prevent detect and address sexual abuse of prisoners by its own employees. The BOP has a new director Colette S. Peters and she stated that she's begun to consider requests from inmates who are victims of sexual abuse and are not considered to be a threat if they are released. However, advocates feel that considering those cases is not enough and they are pushing the United States Sentencing Commission to give inmates the right to directly request a compassionate release ruling from trial judges instead of having to go through the Bureau.",subjective,prison

Thank you Mr. Ranking member. As I understand it the function before the archivist of the United States is what has been described as ministerial in function so the archivist is publishes an amendment when it is part of the Constitution not the decider. Very good and I think that's exactly right in some ways would probably be similar to sort of the certification of an election you know when the vice president comes in it's thought to be ministerial not that the vice president had the power to change or alter the election. Will you allow security at the archives to force people to cover clothing that has political speech on it? Thank you Mr. Ranking member for that question absolutely not. Will you get to the bottom of how it happened to make sure that we don't have people I don't know if this was some a rogue person out there doing this or if the previous those in charge were encouraging this but we promised to get to the bottom of it. Absolutely Mr. Ranking member. I think one of the things American people hate most about government is when it appears as if justice or the adjudication of justice is partial you know when you know Lady Liberty's not blind Lady Justice is not blind that there are different standards for people depending on their party and at least from where I said a lot of Republicans felt like there was a different standard you know and it'd be really in the way the FBI treated Donald Trump and Joe Biden. The bigger problem though I think is that everything is classified we just we classify everything the menu at the White House is supposedly classified I mean we've got problems with too much classification but it also makes oversight difficult so for example a million Americans died from COVID somewhere between 12 15 maybe 18 million people died worldwide from COVID and I can't get records from the NIH because they classify more they send them to the NIH I think it was HHS and is a 250 page document and redacted the whole thing. This is just sort of an insult and you know how we get to it you don't have complete control of this but I think you have some control over the older records how do you understand your role on the older records with being part of declassifying older records. Thank you for that question yes as I understand it the agency that classifies information has the responsibility for and the choice to declassify that information but there is the National Declassification Center at the National Archives located in Maryland and if I am confirmed I plan to of course visit the National Declassification Center and also prioritize as you said Mr. Making member the older records they're waiting for declassification figuring out how we can be most efficient in doing this and how we can strengthen relationships with those classifying agencies those classifying entities so that we are able to move some of these older documents through the process I agree with that and really just for the record here on the presidential you know controversy what we're stuck with now is you know millions of dollars will be spent on these investigations and there should be an investigation of neither Biden nor Trump nor Pence on this they should be told you know what these are rules and we should try to work with people that were in office I think we're not going to find that the secrets to making you know a nuclear weapon we're at someone's house I think we're going to find that a lot of stuff's classified that doesn't need to be classified but it began with sort of a witch hunt for Trump everybody loved it they love you know the media cackled and rubbed their hands together and it went on for weeks and weeks they had Donald Trump they were going to get him they're going to put him in jail like all the rest of the governments you know they're controlled by one party around the country they just had glee until Biden was found to have records in much less secure place next to his you know Corvette and his garage but I think we've overreacted to both and I've talked with a chairman and others on the other side that we need to do something about this this overclassification problem and what little part you can be of it and I realize and don't want you to create ball but what you can do on the older records I think we would appreciate trying to get less and I look forward to working with the chairman I'm trying to to change this because we can't have true oversight of government if HHS and NIH is telling us you know it's none of your business I mean we really have to get a hold of what's going on and to be the covid thing isn't about isn't about Biden at all a lot of this happened in the previous administration so really it shouldn't be partisan at all we should all want to find these records I'm going to reserve my time for later if that's okay that's fine,subjective,constitution

Earlier this month, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the federal agencies, including the FBI and DHS, likely violated the First Amendment. In fact, the judge said it was one of the worst, if not the worst, violation of the First Amendment in the history in our American history. Our federal government is still undertaking many of the same tactics to be unworthy of democracy, and occasionally reminiscent of totalitarian regimes. Today, it was revealed on Capitol Hill and news you aren't supposed to know that, indeed, we are being censored, and our freedom of speech has been violated countless times. The FBI continues to misuse its authority under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Survey Lens Act. You would think we'd be going after foreigners, but we are using the Foreign Intelligence Survey Lens Act to go after Americans. It's also revealed that, as we suspected, the government has an approved message, even when that message is false. You are to know. And if anything differs from that government-approved message, even if it's untrue, it could be taken down and countless were investigated illegally. We're targeted and surveilled for contradicting the approved government initiative. And narrative. Think we're safe from creeping dictatorship or to totalitarianism? We'll think again. Worsing social media companies to remove speech, the government disagreed with FBI and DHS, regularly met with social media companies and pressured them to remove content, it deemed as misinformation, including posts and accounts that originated from within the United States, and including posts and accounts that are verifiably true. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that federal agencies, including the FBI, have likely trampled on the First Amendment. The judge general back either calling it potentially the most severe First Amendment violation and US history. The scariest part is that there is no checks and balances because the government has no incentive to do anything because they are the ones who want your narrative to be controlled. Intelligence agencies use their powers to serve ideological purposes attempting to covertly influence social policy and political action. Senator Rand Paul pulls the veil of a dark troop. The government distorted and exaggerated facts, leveraged mass media and attacked the leadership of groups it considered to be threats to the social order. And a recent investigation has uncovered decades of abuse by federal intelligence agencies against ordinary Americans. Even groups like the NAACP to women's liberation groups, anyone opposing the government's approved narrative faced surveillance and intimidation. Revealing decades of widespread abuse by federal intelligence agencies against US citizens. It's chilling. The government has scripted message in anyone that deviates from it, even with the truth, is silenced. And the censorship of the Constitution, a constitutionally protected speech on social media, is just one example of actions in recent years weaponizing the federal government against its people. Protect our rights and follow me for more on this and other news that isn't approved to be revealed that you need to know.",subjective,government censorship

We're not getting cooperation from your agency. And then I gave them a couple examples. There's two areas that the American public can get information out of the government. One is FOIA requests. And unfortunately, that often has to go through a court and have that be court ordered, although it shouldn't be. And then through congressional oversight, right? So I have two examples of both. This was a document. These are the famous anti-fouche emails. OK. Through a FOIA request, people got them early. And what we did is, shortly after, we had five members of this committee. There's actually a law. Five USC 2954 that says, if five members of this committee request information, the government shall provide it. So under that statute, we wrote the letter, we got this document. OK. This is dated February 4th. The classification here is the exception 4, is why it's redacted. And that has to do with trade secrets or confidential, commercial, or financial information. This is the same document recently produced under FOIA to the general public. It's not redacted. So now I know what's under the redactions. Cereo passage in ACE2 transgenic mice. But that's what was covered up. This is Anthony Fauci with question marks going. This is in February 4th. He's already recognized that maybe the claim from a lab, from experiments with those humanized mice. That was denied Congress in our oversight capability. A couple days earlier, similar type of thing. This is what we got in congressional oversight, all redacted. This is what was obtained under FOIA request. So again, we can see under the redactions now. And again, not because the agency gave it to us, because the court ordered it. It's interesting. This is classified under exception number five, which is deliberative process, inter or intraagency communications. What's interesting about this email chain, it includes Jeremy Ferraro of the welcome trust. He doesn't work for US government agencies. So you've already blown the privilege in terms of confidentiality. So again, they're not following the law. Through the accommodation process, we ask for all 4,000 pages. We narrowed it down to 400. They wouldn't give them to us. They allowed us to read it in a reading room. We could take notes, no copies. Over the course of a year, up until about January 2022, we got 350 of the 400 pages requested. Since January 2022, we've been fighting tooth and nail for the last 50 pages.

Since the horrific terrorist attacks committed by Hamas against innocent people in Israel a few weeks ago, we've been working around the clock to support our partners there and to protect Americans here at home. We assess that the actions of Hamas and its allies will serve as an inspiration the likes of which we haven't seen since ISIS launched its so-called caliphate several years ago. In just the past few weeks, multiple foreign terrorist organizations have called for attacks against Americans and the West. Al-Qaeda issued its most specific call to attack the United States in the last five years. ISIS urged its followers to target Jewish communities in the United States and Europe. Hezbollah has publicly expressed its support for Hamas and threatened to attack U.S. interests in the Middle East. And we've seen an increase in attacks on U.S. military bases overseas carried out by militia groups backed by Iran. Here in the United States, our most immediate concern is that violent extremists, individuals or small groups will draw inspiration from the events in the Middle East to carry out attacks against Americans going about their daily lives. That includes not just homegrown violent extremists inspired by a foreign terrorist organization, but also domestic violent extremists targeting Jewish or Muslim communities. We've already seen that with the individual we arrested last week in Houston who'd been studying how to build bombs and posted online about his support for killing Jews. And with the tragic killing of a six-year-old Muslim boy in Illinois and what we're investigating is a federal hate crime. But as I said a few moments ago, on top of the homegrown violent extremists and domestic violent extremists threat, we also cannot and do not discount the possibility that Hamas or another foreign terrorist organization may exploit the current conflict to conduct attacks here on our own soil. We have kept our sights on Hamas and have multiple ongoing investigations into individuals affiliated with that foreign terrorist organization. And while historically our Hamas cases have identified individuals located here who are facilitating and financing Hamas' terrorism overseas, we're continuing to scrutinize our intelligence to assess how the threat may be evolving. But it's not just Hamas. As the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, the Iranians, for instance, have directly, or by hiring criminals, mounted assassination attempts against dissidents and high-ranking current and former U.S. government officials, including right here on American soil.",subjective,terror

Well I have not considered myself in those terms, Senator. Well let me explain what I mean. You have 125 motions pending that you declined to decide. Well, let me finish. That's more than any other district judge in the entire seventh circuit. In fact, you rank seven tires nationally. Do you not? I am not familiar with those statistics, Senator Kennedy. You haven't looked. I did look in preparation for this hearing but I didn't compare myself to others. You haven't seen that you ranked the seventh the worst in the country in terms of making decisions. You are the first to tell me this. And I think for me, I stress the quality of my decision in making. And as I explained, I came on. I was the first district judge to come on during this administration. Yeah, but so are all the others. I mean, there have been 68 district judges confirmed in the 117th Congress in terms of motions pending for more than six months. You rank number three. You all came on at the same time. You all had the same problems with COVID. You're the third worst. You really think of all the other district judges in the seventh circuit. You're the one that ought to be promoted based on this record. Senator, this is something that I've discussed with my fellow judges. Many of us new judges from not you said you'd never looked at these statistics. I haven't these particular statistics. I am not familiar with. But in terms of new judges, both from the current administration and the former administration, we are quite a collegial bunch. And oftentimes talk about the pressures of a new judge and the way reassignments work in our district, which is that you get, for example, 300 cases. As I understand, I'm familiar with the procedure in federal court. Here's what I'm trying to understand. Why is your record so bad? Well, I don't view it that way, Senator. And I look at the quality of my decision making, the feedback that I get from parties. Well, first parties are not going to criticize you. That points you to ruin their favor. I understand, Senator Kennedy. That's just the way it works. Help me understand why you have such an abysmal, record-ing moving cases. I mean, it costs a lot of money to mitigate. And people are paying lawyers. And time is money. And of all the district court judges in the seventh circuit, you're the worst. In terms of moving cases, why do you think you deserve to be promoted over all of those others? So, Senator, again, I'm not familiar with the statistics, but I stand by my record and that I give parties what they need. I think, I am regularly in my courtroom. I am regularly issuing decisions. I just came on at a very difficult time where there was a backlog in the courts. So, do everybody, I'll just ask you, when you were partnering your law firm, volunteered to write a brief on behalf of the Brady Center, you wrote the brief and this is what you said. You volunteered for this. You weren't being paid. Is that right? This was a pro bono case that one of my partners wrote in. You said, quote, assault weapons may be banned because they're extraordinarily dangerous and are not appropriate for legitimate self-defense purposes. Close quote. Tell me what you meant by assault weapons. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Just to clarify, just to clarify there, I was local counsel. Our Supreme Court. But you wrote the brief. Tell me what you meant by assault weapons. Senator Kennedy, actually, I did not write the brief. The brief was written by- You signed the brief, though, did you? Correct. So, I'm not a brief. You're testifying to the court that everything in it is true, right? Yes. And I- So, you're words in terms of the court, right? Well, you're correct, Senator Kennedy. I would never sign- I'm not what you meant by assault weapons. So, I am not a gun expert. And at the time, that brief, I think, was about ten years- Given the court advice about, say, ban assault weapons, what is- You told the court you were an expert. Just tell me what you wanted to ban. Senator, sitting here today, as I said, I did not write that brief. I was local counsel- Sign the brief. I understand. At the time- Tell me what you wanted to ban. That's all I want to know. I don't remember the exact definition of assault weapons in the ordinance that was at issue. So, you submitted a brief to the- On a penalty brief, you signed it. And you don't know what- And you said, abolish assault weapons, and you don't know what- You wanted them to abolish. Senator, at the time that I signed the brief, I- I read the brief, because the- Our Supreme Court required someone- An Illinois bar- Remember to sign the brief. I was not responsible for researching the content. You were responsible for the brief. You signed- Absolutely, absolutely. And sitting here today, I do not remember the characteristics of- That were cited in the ordinance for the assault weapons ban. It's not an area of practice that I have specialized in. I'm sure, 10 years ago, I would- I could have answered your question. And sitting here today- You want- You think you serve the fee for murder? What's your record? Senator, I- I stand by my record.

Senator Booker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is along as you said, over years overdue hearing. The cops program was vital to my city when I was mayor of the city. I don't know how we would have survived in our mission without it. My police officers that I almost literally lived with during my days or some of the most heroic people I have ever seen. I am proud that under the Biden administration we have not just continued to fund the cops program but have funded it at historic levels. I have some concerns and the first one is sort of a stunning to me, sir. I've looked at your record. You are an extraordinary public safety official. Your record in your state and your leadership was incredible but something happened and I remind you you are under oath but did you say that you would not show up to this hearing if we had another panel focused on the community? I never said that. Again, and maybe we need to clarify, you are not aware of your office asking for us not to have a second panel dealing with community issues. I am not aware of that, Senator. I find that surprising given what I have heard and frankly the things I have heard from your office this last couple of weeks have been extraordinarily frustrating. I am trying not to take them personally. I am just one senator from what I have heard. You don't give a damn what I think but I will tell you this, the work and the obligations that you have are critical and what is the C stand for in the cops program? Community. Right. And do you think under oath that it would be really important that this committee have a panel hearing from community stakeholders about this program? I do and I thought that was the case and I couldn't agree more with you, Senator, that C is in the word cops because community are part of policing and the word public is in public safety for that reason as well. And you know from your experience, again, everything I review, you are extraordinary public safety official with a career to be really proud of. Thank you, Senator. And yet right now my concern is with a program I support that I want to see reauthorize that I'm grateful to hear Lindsey Graham talk about modernizing the program. The frustrations I've had over the last week with your office is just understanding what metrics you keep. Now you were a leader of police force. I let a city data, transparency, accountability, the sophistication of your metrics is vital for public safety, is it not? It is. And Senator, I want to stress the importance of you getting the information and data you need. So I'm glad you're saying this right now under oath, but I, I, I, Democrat Republican presidents I haven't had the kind of frustrations and heard the things I've heard from agencies like I have over years, last couple of weeks. You talk about de-confliction grants. What data do you collect to see if those grants are effective? So there have been many researchers and studies done over the years. I came into this assignment in January of 23. But I, I, so in the last year and quarter is your organization as a guy who understands a leadership and I know this from looking at your record, the importance of collecting data and having public transparency, does your office collect data when it comes to the de-confliction grants you have about use of force, about civilian complaints, about incidents of misconduct? Do you look at the before and after of the grants that you're giving out, critical data that would help us understand if the millions of dollars, we are putting hundreds of millions of dollars, we're putting this program are actually effective. So, so, Senator, we do have quarterly and semi annual financial progress reports, progress reports from these agencies that we review on a routine basis throughout that year, throughout the grant period. We are not an investigative agent. So you're not, but you're giving out grants that have specific ends and you've given Congress no transparency, no data to understand whether the money we're investing is producing the results. The information I have been able to get from your, from your office, the public information says that you barely do 10% of reviews of the grantees that get the resources, that you're barely collecting the kind of data on, on the various mission of your organization that would give us some kind of clarification if we're making investments that are reaping results. I agree with Senator Graham, we need to modernize the collection of data because in the last two weeks, I have been utterly frustrated to understand what your office is doing besides counting the numbers of police officers that are hired with the grants, which is vital and why I support this program, why I have voted for its historic funding, but as two men who have been responsible for the safety of our communities and understand the urgency and importance of connections to community, of building trust between law enforcement and community, I know that transparency matters and I know that accountability matters. You're not to manage these departments you give grants to, but you have an obligation for the taxpayer money that you're giving out to make sure it's making some progress towards its mission. This is to me vital for the success of this program and sir, it's vital for me because this is great as my police department is and as much as the change that they've made, I still live in a black and brown community where the number one issue in my community is public safety, where I still even as a result of the last year have shootings in my community where my family lives. And so I know what drives change as do you because I've read everything I can about your career. When you are in law enforcement, you demand a transparency, you demand the data, you demand accountability, you demand real methods to build community trust. Why now do we have an agency like yours that doesn't collect the most basic things that we would need to inform a real authorization of this program? And I think Mr. Chairman, my time is up, but we need to put in this grant things that will modernize this program so we have more transparency and accountability for the money we're giving out. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",subjective,police reform

Well I have not considered myself in those terms, Senator. Well let me explain what I mean. You have 125 motions pending that you declined to decide. Well, let me finish. That's more than any other district judge in the entire seventh circuit. In fact, you rank seven tires nationally. Do you not? I am not familiar with those statistics, Senator Kennedy. You haven't looked. I did look in preparation for this hearing but I didn't compare myself to others. You haven't seen that you ranked the seventh the worst in the country in terms of making decisions. You are the first to tell me this. And I think for me, I stress the quality of my decision in making. And as I explained, I came on. I was the first district judge to come on during this administration. Yeah, but so are all the others. I mean, there have been 68 district judges confirmed in the 117th Congress in terms of motions pending for more than six months. You rank number three. You all came on at the same time. You all had the same problems with COVID. You're the third worst. You really think of all the other district judges in the seventh circuit. You're the one that ought to be promoted based on this record. Senator, this is something that I've discussed with my fellow judges. Many of us new judges from not you said you'd never looked at these statistics. I haven't these particular statistics. I am not familiar with. But in terms of new judges, both from the current administration and the former administration, we are quite a collegial bunch. And oftentimes talk about the pressures of a new judge and the way reassignments work in our district, which is that you get, for example, 300 cases. As I understand, I'm familiar with the procedure in federal court. Here's what I'm trying to understand. Why is your record so bad? Well, I don't view it that way, Senator. And I look at the quality of my decision making, the feedback that I get from parties. Well, first parties are not going to criticize you. That points you to ruin their favor. I understand, Senator Kennedy. That's just the way it works. Help me understand why you have such an abysmal, record-ing moving cases. I mean, it costs a lot of money to mitigate. And people are paying lawyers. And time is money. And of all the district court judges in the seventh circuit, you're the worst. In terms of moving cases, why do you think you deserve to be promoted over all of those others? So, Senator, again, I'm not familiar with the statistics, but I stand by my record and that I give parties what they need. I think, I am regularly in my courtroom. I am regularly issuing decisions. I just came on at a very difficult time where there was a backlog in the courts.

And at the time, that brief, I think, was about ten years- Given the court advice about, say, ban assault weapons, what is- You told the court you were an expert. Just tell me what you wanted to ban. Senator, sitting here today, as I said, I did not write that brief. I was local counsel- Sign the brief. I understand. At the time- Tell me what you wanted to ban. That's all I want to know. I don't remember the exact definition of assault weapons in the ordinance that was at issue. So, you submitted a brief to the- On a penalty brief, you signed it. And you don't know what- And you said, abolish assault weapons, and you don't know what- You wanted them to abolish.

Senator Booker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is along as you said, over years overdue hearing. The cops program was vital to my city when I was mayor of the city. I don't know how we would have survived in our mission without it. My police officers that I almost literally lived with during my days or some of the most heroic people I have ever seen. I am proud that under the Biden administration we have not just continued to fund the cops program but have funded it at historic levels. I have some concerns and the first one is sort of a stunning to me, sir. I've looked at your record. You are an extraordinary public safety official. Your record in your state and your leadership was incredible but something happened and I remind you you are under oath but did you say that you would not show up to this hearing if we had another panel focused on the community? I never said that. Again, and maybe we need to clarify, you are not aware of your office asking for us not to have a second panel dealing with community issues. I am not aware of that, Senator. I find that surprising given what I have heard and frankly the things I have heard from your office this last couple of weeks have been extraordinarily frustrating. I am trying not to take them personally. I am just one senator from what I have heard. You don't give a damn what I think but I will tell you this, the work and the obligations that you have are critical and what is the C stand for in the cops program? Community. Right. And do you think under oath that it would be really important that this committee have a panel hearing from community stakeholders about this program? I do and I thought that was the case and I couldn't agree more with you, Senator, that C is in the word cops because community are part of policing and the word public is in public safety for that reason as well. And you know from your experience, again, everything I review, you are extraordinary public safety official with a career to be really proud of. Thank you, Senator. And yet right now my concern is with a program I support that I want to see reauthorize that I'm grateful to hear Lindsey Graham talk about modernizing the program. The frustrations I've had over the last week with your office is just understanding what metrics you keep. Now you were a leader of police force. I let a city data, transparency, accountability, the sophistication of your metrics is vital for public safety, is it not? It is. And Senator, I want to stress the importance of you getting the information and data you need. So I'm glad you're saying this right now under oath, but I, I, I, Democrat Republican presidents I haven't had the kind of frustrations and heard the things I've heard from agencies like I have over years, last couple of weeks. You talk about de-confliction grants. What data do you collect to see if those grants are effective? So there have been many researchers and studies done over the years. I came into this assignment in January of 23. But I, I, so in the last year and quarter is your organization as a guy who understands a leadership and I know this from looking at your record, the importance of collecting data and having public transparency, does your office collect data when it comes to the de-confliction grants you have about use of force, about civilian complaints, about incidents of misconduct? Do you look at the before and after of the grants that you're giving out, critical data that would help us understand if the millions of dollars, we are putting hundreds of millions of dollars, we're putting this program are actually effective. So, so, Senator, we do have quarterly and semi annual financial progress reports, progress reports from these agencies that we review on a routine basis throughout that year, throughout the grant period. We are not an investigative agent. So you're not, but you're giving out grants that have specific ends and you've given Congress no transparency, no data to understand whether the money we're investing is producing the results. The information I have been able to get from your, from your office, the public information says that you barely do 10% of reviews of the grantees that get the resources, that you're barely collecting the kind of data on, on the various mission of your organization that would give us some kind of clarification if we're making investments that are reaping results. I agree with Senator Graham, we need to modernize the collection of data because in the last two weeks, I have been utterly frustrated to understand what your office is doing besides counting the numbers of police officers that are hired with the grants, which is vital and why I support this program, why I have voted for its historic funding, but as two men who have been responsible for the safety of our communities and understand the urgency and importance of connections to community, of building trust between law enforcement and community, I know that transparency matters and I know that accountability matters. You're not to manage these departments you give grants to, but you have an obligation for the taxpayer money that you're giving out to make sure it's making some progress towards its mission. This is to me vital for the success of this program and sir, it's vital for me because this is great as my police department is and as much as the change that they've made, I still live in a black and brown community where the number one issue in my community is public safety, where I still even as a result of the last year have shootings in my community where my family lives. And so I know what drives change as do you because I've read everything I can about your career. When you are in law enforcement, you demand a transparency, you demand the data, you demand accountability, you demand real methods to build community trust. Why now do we have an agency like yours that doesn't collect the most basic things that we would need to inform a real authorization of this program? And I think Mr. Chairman, my time is up, but we need to put in this grant things that will modernize this program so we have more transparency and accountability for the money we're giving out. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",subjective,police reform

That's more than any other district judge in the entire seventh circuit. In fact, you rank seven tires nationally. Do you not? I am not familiar with those statistics, Senator Kennedy. You haven't looked. I did look in preparation for this hearing but I didn't compare myself to others. You haven't seen that you ranked the seventh the worst in the country in terms of making decisions. You are the first to tell me this. And I think for me, I stress the quality of my decision in making. And as I explained, I came on. I was the first district judge to come on during this administration. Yeah, but so are all the others. I mean, there have been 68 district judges confirmed in the 117th Congress in terms of motions pending for more than six months. You rank number three. You all came on at the same time. You all had the same problems with COVID. You're the third worst. You really think of all the other district judges in the seventh circuit. You're the one that ought to be promoted based on this record. Senator, this is something that I've discussed with my fellow judges. Many of us new judges from not you said you'd never looked at these statistics. I haven't these particular statistics. I am not familiar with. But in terms of new judges, both from the current administration and the former administration, we are quite a collegial bunch. And oftentimes talk about the pressures of a new judge and the way reassignments work in our district, which is that you get, for example, 300 cases. As I understand, I'm familiar with the procedure in federal court. Here's what I'm trying to understand. Why is your record so bad? Well, I don't view it that way, Senator. And I look at the quality of my decision making, the feedback that I get from parties. Well, first parties are not going to criticize you. That points you to ruin their favor. I understand, Senator Kennedy. That's just the way it works. Help me understand why you have such an abysmal, record-ing moving cases. I mean, it costs a lot of money to mitigate. And people are paying lawyers. And time is money. And of all the district court judges in the seventh circuit, you're the worst. In terms of moving cases, why do you think you deserve to be promoted over all of those others? So, Senator, again, I'm not familiar with the statistics, but I stand by my record and that I give parties what they need. I think, I am regularly in my courtroom. I am regularly issuing decisions.

Senator, sitting here today, as I said, I did not write that brief. I was local counsel- Sign the brief. I understand. At the time- Tell me what you wanted to ban. That's all I want to know. I don't remember the exact definition of assault weapons in the ordinance that was at issue. So, you submitted a brief to the- On a penalty brief, you signed it.

Senator Booker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is along as you said, over years overdue hearing. The cops program was vital to my city when I was mayor of the city. I don't know how we would have survived in our mission without it. My police officers that I almost literally lived with during my days or some of the most heroic people I have ever seen. I am proud that under the Biden administration we have not just continued to fund the cops program but have funded it at historic levels. I have some concerns and the first one is sort of a stunning to me, sir. I've looked at your record. You are an extraordinary public safety official. Your record in your state and your leadership was incredible but something happened and I remind you you are under oath but did you say that you would not show up to this hearing if we had another panel focused on the community? I never said that. Again, and maybe we need to clarify, you are not aware of your office asking for us not to have a second panel dealing with community issues. I am not aware of that, Senator. I find that surprising given what I have heard and frankly the things I have heard from your office this last couple of weeks have been extraordinarily frustrating. I am trying not to take them personally. I am just one senator from what I have heard. You don't give a damn what I think but I will tell you this, the work and the obligations that you have are critical and what is the C stand for in the cops program? Community. Right. And do you think under oath that it would be really important that this committee have a panel hearing from community stakeholders about this program? I do and I thought that was the case and I couldn't agree more with you, Senator, that C is in the word cops because community are part of policing and the word public is in public safety for that reason as well. And you know from your experience, again, everything I review, you are extraordinary public safety official with a career to be really proud of. Thank you, Senator. And yet right now my concern is with a program I support that I want to see reauthorize that I'm grateful to hear Lindsey Graham talk about modernizing the program. The frustrations I've had over the last week with your office is just understanding what metrics you keep. Now you were a leader of police force. I let a city data, transparency, accountability, the sophistication of your metrics is vital for public safety, is it not? It is. And Senator, I want to stress the importance of you getting the information and data you need. So I'm glad you're saying this right now under oath, but I, I, I, Democrat Republican presidents I haven't had the kind of frustrations and heard the things I've heard from agencies like I have over years, last couple of weeks. You talk about de-confliction grants. What data do you collect to see if those grants are effective? So there have been many researchers and studies done over the years. I came into this assignment in January of 23. But I, I, so in the last year and quarter is your organization as a guy who understands a leadership and I know this from looking at your record, the importance of collecting data and having public transparency, does your office collect data when it comes to the de-confliction grants you have about use of force, about civilian complaints, about incidents of misconduct? Do you look at the before and after of the grants that you're giving out, critical data that would help us understand if the millions of dollars, we are putting hundreds of millions of dollars, we're putting this program are actually effective. So, so, Senator, we do have quarterly and semi annual financial progress reports, progress reports from these agencies that we review on a routine basis throughout that year, throughout the grant period. We are not an investigative agent. So you're not, but you're giving out grants that have specific ends and you've given Congress no transparency, no data to understand whether the money we're investing is producing the results. The information I have been able to get from your, from your office, the public information says that you barely do 10% of reviews of the grantees that get the resources, that you're barely collecting the kind of data on, on the various mission of your organization that would give us some kind of clarification if we're making investments that are reaping results. I agree with Senator Graham, we need to modernize the collection of data because in the last two weeks, I have been utterly frustrated to understand what your office is doing besides counting the numbers of police officers that are hired with the grants, which is vital and why I support this program, why I have voted for its historic funding, but as two men who have been responsible for the safety of our communities and understand the urgency and importance of connections to community, of building trust between law enforcement and community, I know that transparency matters and I know that accountability matters. You're not to manage these departments you give grants to, but you have an obligation for the taxpayer money that you're giving out to make sure it's making some progress towards its mission. This is to me vital for the success of this program and sir, it's vital for me because this is great as my police department is and as much as the change that they've made, I still live in a black and brown community where the number one issue in my community is public safety, where I still even as a result of the last year have shootings in my community where my family lives. And so I know what drives change as do you because I've read everything I can about your career. When you are in law enforcement, you demand a transparency, you demand the data, you demand accountability, you demand real methods to build community trust. Why now do we have an agency like yours that doesn't collect the most basic things that we would need to inform a real authorization of this program? And I think Mr. Chairman, my time is up, but we need to put in this grant things that will modernize this program so we have more transparency and accountability for the money we're giving out. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",subjective,police reform

You haven't looked. I did look in preparation for this hearing but I didn't compare myself to others. You haven't seen that you ranked the seventh the worst in the country in terms of making decisions. You are the first to tell me this. And I think for me, I stress the quality of my decision in making. And as I explained, I came on. I was the first district judge to come on during this administration. Yeah, but so are all the others. I mean, there have been 68 district judges confirmed in the 117th Congress in terms of motions pending for more than six months. You rank number three. You all came on at the same time. You all had the same problems with COVID. You're the third worst. You really think of all the other district judges in the seventh circuit. You're the one that ought to be promoted based on this record. Senator, this is something that I've discussed with my fellow judges. Many of us new judges from not you said you'd never looked at these statistics. I haven't these particular statistics. I am not familiar with. But in terms of new judges, both from the current administration and the former administration, we are quite a collegial bunch. And oftentimes talk about the pressures of a new judge and the way reassignments work in our district, which is that you get, for example, 300 cases. As I understand, I'm familiar with the procedure in federal court. Here's what I'm trying to understand. Why is your record so bad? Well, I don't view it that way, Senator. And I look at the quality of my decision making, the feedback that I get from parties. Well, first parties are not going to criticize you. That points you to ruin their favor. I understand, Senator Kennedy. That's just the way it works. Help me understand why you have such an abysmal, record-ing moving cases. I mean, it costs a lot of money to mitigate. And people are paying lawyers. And time is money. And of all the district court judges in the seventh circuit, you're the worst. In terms of moving cases, why do you think you deserve to be promoted over all of those others?

Senator Booker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is along as you said, over years overdue hearing. The cops program was vital to my city when I was mayor of the city. I don't know how we would have survived in our mission without it. My police officers that I almost literally lived with during my days or some of the most heroic people I have ever seen. I am proud that under the Biden administration we have not just continued to fund the cops program but have funded it at historic levels. I have some concerns and the first one is sort of a stunning to me, sir. I've looked at your record. You are an extraordinary public safety official. Your record in your state and your leadership was incredible but something happened and I remind you you are under oath but did you say that you would not show up to this hearing if we had another panel focused on the community? I never said that. Again, and maybe we need to clarify, you are not aware of your office asking for us not to have a second panel dealing with community issues. I am not aware of that, Senator. I find that surprising given what I have heard and frankly the things I have heard from your office this last couple of weeks have been extraordinarily frustrating. I am trying not to take them personally. I am just one senator from what I have heard. You don't give a damn what I think but I will tell you this, the work and the obligations that you have are critical and what is the C stand for in the cops program? Community. Right. And do you think under oath that it would be really important that this committee have a panel hearing from community stakeholders about this program? I do and I thought that was the case and I couldn't agree more with you, Senator, that C is in the word cops because community are part of policing and the word public is in public safety for that reason as well. And you know from your experience, again, everything I review, you are extraordinary public safety official with a career to be really proud of. Thank you, Senator. And yet right now my concern is with a program I support that I want to see reauthorize that I'm grateful to hear Lindsey Graham talk about modernizing the program. The frustrations I've had over the last week with your office is just understanding what metrics you keep. Now you were a leader of police force. I let a city data, transparency, accountability, the sophistication of your metrics is vital for public safety, is it not? It is. And Senator, I want to stress the importance of you getting the information and data you need. So I'm glad you're saying this right now under oath, but I, I, I, Democrat Republican presidents I haven't had the kind of frustrations and heard the things I've heard from agencies like I have over years, last couple of weeks. You talk about de-confliction grants. What data do you collect to see if those grants are effective? So there have been many researchers and studies done over the years. I came into this assignment in January of 23. But I, I, so in the last year and quarter is your organization as a guy who understands a leadership and I know this from looking at your record, the importance of collecting data and having public transparency, does your office collect data when it comes to the de-confliction grants you have about use of force, about civilian complaints, about incidents of misconduct? Do you look at the before and after of the grants that you're giving out, critical data that would help us understand if the millions of dollars, we are putting hundreds of millions of dollars, we're putting this program are actually effective. So, so, Senator, we do have quarterly and semi annual financial progress reports, progress reports from these agencies that we review on a routine basis throughout that year, throughout the grant period. We are not an investigative agent. So you're not, but you're giving out grants that have specific ends and you've given Congress no transparency, no data to understand whether the money we're investing is producing the results. The information I have been able to get from your, from your office, the public information says that you barely do 10% of reviews of the grantees that get the resources, that you're barely collecting the kind of data on, on the various mission of your organization that would give us some kind of clarification if we're making investments that are reaping results. I agree with Senator Graham, we need to modernize the collection of data because in the last two weeks, I have been utterly frustrated to understand what your office is doing besides counting the numbers of police officers that are hired with the grants, which is vital and why I support this program, why I have voted for its historic funding, but as two men who have been responsible for the safety of our communities and understand the urgency and importance of connections to community, of building trust between law enforcement and community, I know that transparency matters and I know that accountability matters. You're not to manage these departments you give grants to, but you have an obligation for the taxpayer money that you're giving out to make sure it's making some progress towards its mission. This is to me vital for the success of this program and sir, it's vital for me because this is great as my police department is and as much as the change that they've made, I still live in a black and brown community where the number one issue in my community is public safety, where I still even as a result of the last year have shootings in my community where my family lives. And so I know what drives change as do you because I've read everything I can about your career. When you are in law enforcement, you demand a transparency, you demand the data, you demand accountability, you demand real methods to build community trust. Why now do we have an agency like yours that doesn't collect the most basic things that we would need to inform a real authorization of this program? And I think Mr. Chairman, my time is up, but we need to put in this grant things that will modernize this program so we have more transparency and accountability for the money we're giving out. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",subjective,police reform

That's more than any other district judge in the entire seventh circuit. In fact, you rank seven tires nationally. Do you not? I am not familiar with those statistics, Senator Kennedy. You haven't looked. I did look in preparation for this hearing but I didn't compare myself to others. You haven't seen that you ranked the seventh the worst in the country in terms of making decisions. You are the first to tell me this. And I think for me, I stress the quality of my decision in making. And as I explained, I came on. I was the first district judge to come on during this administration. Yeah, but so are all the others. I mean, there have been 68 district judges confirmed in the 117th Congress in terms of motions pending for more than six months. You rank number three. You all came on at the same time. You all had the same problems with COVID. You're the third worst. You really think of all the other district judges in the seventh circuit. You're the one that ought to be promoted based on this record. Senator, this is something that I've discussed with my fellow judges. Many of us new judges from not you said you'd never looked at these statistics. I haven't these particular statistics. I am not familiar with. But in terms of new judges, both from the current administration and the former administration, we are quite a collegial bunch. And oftentimes talk about the pressures of a new judge and the way reassignments work in our district, which is that you get, for example, 300 cases. As I understand, I'm familiar with the procedure in federal court. Here's what I'm trying to understand. Why is your record so bad? Well, I don't view it that way, Senator. And I look at the quality of my decision making, the feedback that I get from parties. Well, first parties are not going to criticize you. That points you to ruin their favor. I understand, Senator Kennedy. That's just the way it works. Help me understand why you have such an abysmal, record-ing moving cases. I mean, it costs a lot of money to mitigate. And people are paying lawyers. And time is money. And of all the district court judges in the seventh circuit, you're the worst. In terms of moving cases, why do you think you deserve to be promoted over all of those others? So, Senator, again, I'm not familiar with the statistics, but I stand by my record and that I give parties what they need. I think, I am regularly in my courtroom. I am regularly issuing decisions.

Senator Booker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is along as you said, over years overdue hearing. The cops program was vital to my city when I was mayor of the city. I don't know how we would have survived in our mission without it. My police officers that I almost literally lived with during my days or some of the most heroic people I have ever seen. I am proud that under the Biden administration we have not just continued to fund the cops program but have funded it at historic levels. I have some concerns and the first one is sort of a stunning to me, sir. I've looked at your record. You are an extraordinary public safety official. Your record in your state and your leadership was incredible but something happened and I remind you you are under oath but did you say that you would not show up to this hearing if we had another panel focused on the community? I never said that. Again, and maybe we need to clarify, you are not aware of your office asking for us not to have a second panel dealing with community issues. I am not aware of that, Senator. I find that surprising given what I have heard and frankly the things I have heard from your office this last couple of weeks have been extraordinarily frustrating. I am trying not to take them personally. I am just one senator from what I have heard. You don't give a damn what I think but I will tell you this, the work and the obligations that you have are critical and what is the C stand for in the cops program? Community. Right. And do you think under oath that it would be really important that this committee have a panel hearing from community stakeholders about this program? I do and I thought that was the case and I couldn't agree more with you, Senator, that C is in the word cops because community are part of policing and the word public is in public safety for that reason as well. And you know from your experience, again, everything I review, you are extraordinary public safety official with a career to be really proud of. Thank you, Senator. And yet right now my concern is with a program I support that I want to see reauthorize that I'm grateful to hear Lindsey Graham talk about modernizing the program. The frustrations I've had over the last week with your office is just understanding what metrics you keep. Now you were a leader of police force. I let a city data, transparency, accountability, the sophistication of your metrics is vital for public safety, is it not? It is. And Senator, I want to stress the importance of you getting the information and data you need. So I'm glad you're saying this right now under oath, but I, I, I, Democrat Republican presidents I haven't had the kind of frustrations and heard the things I've heard from agencies like I have over years, last couple of weeks. You talk about de-confliction grants. What data do you collect to see if those grants are effective? So there have been many researchers and studies done over the years. I came into this assignment in January of 23. But I, I, so in the last year and quarter is your organization as a guy who understands a leadership and I know this from looking at your record, the importance of collecting data and having public transparency, does your office collect data when it comes to the de-confliction grants you have about use of force, about civilian complaints, about incidents of misconduct? Do you look at the before and after of the grants that you're giving out, critical data that would help us understand if the millions of dollars, we are putting hundreds of millions of dollars, we're putting this program are actually effective. So, so, Senator, we do have quarterly and semi annual financial progress reports, progress reports from these agencies that we review on a routine basis throughout that year, throughout the grant period. We are not an investigative agent. So you're not, but you're giving out grants that have specific ends and you've given Congress no transparency, no data to understand whether the money we're investing is producing the results. The information I have been able to get from your, from your office, the public information says that you barely do 10% of reviews of the grantees that get the resources, that you're barely collecting the kind of data on, on the various mission of your organization that would give us some kind of clarification if we're making investments that are reaping results. I agree with Senator Graham, we need to modernize the collection of data because in the last two weeks, I have been utterly frustrated to understand what your office is doing besides counting the numbers of police officers that are hired with the grants, which is vital and why I support this program, why I have voted for its historic funding, but as two men who have been responsible for the safety of our communities and understand the urgency and importance of connections to community, of building trust between law enforcement and community, I know that transparency matters and I know that accountability matters. You're not to manage these departments you give grants to, but you have an obligation for the taxpayer money that you're giving out to make sure it's making some progress towards its mission. This is to me vital for the success of this program and sir, it's vital for me because this is great as my police department is and as much as the change that they've made, I still live in a black and brown community where the number one issue in my community is public safety, where I still even as a result of the last year have shootings in my community where my family lives. And so I know what drives change as do you because I've read everything I can about your career. When you are in law enforcement, you demand a transparency, you demand the data, you demand accountability, you demand real methods to build community trust. Why now do we have an agency like yours that doesn't collect the most basic things that we would need to inform a real authorization of this program? And I think Mr. Chairman, my time is up, but we need to put in this grant things that will modernize this program so we have more transparency and accountability for the money we're giving out. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",subjective,police reform

Senator, this is exactly why on January 5th we announced that parole for him. Do you know how many? Do you know how many children have been sexually assaulted? This is why we do. You're going to refuse to answer that question as well. Let's move on. It's obvious you've been instructed to Stonewall, so I'm not going to let you. You don't get to Stonewall and filibuster.

That's, I look, I get if you're a partisan spinner, you got to figure out something to say about the absolute catastrophe that is played out under the Biden administration. True or false, Secretary Morricus, 2020 was the lowest rate of illegal immigration in 45 years. Is that true or false? It is certainly the lowest level of immigration in many, many years. And what was it in 2020? Okay, five. 2020. What was it, Senator, in 2020 that impacted the entire world, including the United States? Okay, so your testimony is the reason we had the lowest rate was COVID. It had nothing to do with building the wall, nothing to do with any catch or release, nothing to do with remain in Mexico, with all respect, Mr. Secretary. That answer is laughable. And in fact, if you look at illegal immigration, let's look at CBP encounters. You can see 500,000, 500,000, it drops to the lowest level and boom, what happens? You show up. And that red line is you. That red line is Joe Biden. And you're claiming nothing happened, oh gosh, this was here before us. No, you made the decision to allow this to happen. Let me ask you, we now have over 5.5 million people who've entered this country illegally under Joe Biden. How many murderers have you released into America? Senator, I'm not aware of any murder whom we've sent to the... No, Senator, let me say something. Do you know if you take a look at... No, no, you don't get to give a speech. Do you know how many murders you've released? I'm just trying to answer your question. How many rapists have you released? Senator, I'm trying to answer your question. You can answer, I know or I don't know. Senator, any individual who poses a public safety threat? How many child molesters have you released and removed into the United States? From the United States? So your testimony, under oath, subject to perjury, is that you have not released any murderers, rapist or child molesters, among the 5.5 million, is that your testimony? Mr. Chairman, may I have the opportunity to... No, you may not. You may answer my question. You're not allowed... Is that your testimony? Yes or no? Senator, you're not allowing me to answer your question. I am allowing you to answer, I'm not allowing you to fill up on it. If you take a look at the pace of immigration in 2018 to 2019... You're refusing to answer. Let's move on. Let's move on to Godaways. Godaways are the people that get away that you know about. Now, what happened under your administration? Godaways consistently down at this low-line boom you get in, and they go from below 180,000 to 600,000. Now, I'll tell you this about a Godaway.

That is precisely why... But you refused to answer the question. Do you know how many are rapists? Do you know how many are rapists? This is a question. You're a lawyer. You know how to answer questions of the 600,000. Do you know how many of them were rapists? Senator, this is why we... So, again, the answer is no. Let me ask you this. Do you know how many of them are terrorists? And I don't want to... Senator, here's my lecture on this. Do you know how many of the 600,000 Godaways were terrorists? Yes or no? Senator, we are focused on this. You're refused to answer that as well. What's the result of massive Godaways? Well, one of the results is drug overdoses. And we now have last year over 100,000 overdoses. Who died, the majority from Chinese fentanyl streaming across the border. Now, you told Senator Corning, you care, but look what has happened under your policy. When you open up the border to the worst illegal immigration or nation's history, people die. You claim you care, Mr. Secretary. That is a lie. You know, some months ago, Karin Jean Pierre stood up at a White House briefing and said, people are not just walking across the border. Was she telling the truth? Senator, you are... Was she telling the truth? Don't profoundly disrespect any of the truth. Was she telling the truth? I've been running two years of government insurance. You get to answer questions. You don't have to give speeches. Senator, I served as a federal prosecutor. All right, you're refusing to answer. If you look at, she was lying. And she was not lying on her own. She was lying on behalf of the President of the United States. Now, the photograph people... walking. She was lying on behalf of the President of the United States. This is a photograph from just one day along the Rio Grande. Of hundreds of thousands of people walking across the border. You have allowed this to happen. The photograph that was before. What are these wristbands? I don't know what they are. You don't know what they are. Mr. Secretary, you have just testified to the American people. You're incompetent at your job. Because I've been to the southern border. And if you go to the southern border along the southern border, you see thousands of these wristbands. Because the illegal immigrants wear them. The drug cartels, every color corresponds to how many thousands of dollars they owe the cartels. You have turned these cartels into multi-billion dollar criminal organizations. And these are modern-day legguards. Because these are children being sold into sex slavery. And you don't even know what they are. That is astonishing. Mr. Secretary, how many children have been sold into sex slavery under your administration? Senator, we are taking it to the cartels. How many children have been sold into sex slavery? In an honor. Do you know how many children have been sold into sex slavery? An unprecedented degree. Mr. Secretary, I want to say to you right now, your behavior is disgraceful. And the deaths the children assaulted, the children raped. They are at your feet. And if you had integrity, you would resign. And I will tell you the men and women of the border patrol, they have never had a political leader undermine them. They despise you, Mr. Secretary, because you are willing to let children be raped to follow political orders. This is a crisis. It is a disgrace. And you won't even admit this human tragedy as a discrisse. Claiming one minute, Chairman, time, Mr. Secretary, would you like to respond to any of those questions?

I'm talking about Senator Josh Holley for Missouri and his wife, Aaron. Josh Holley used to be the clerk for our current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts. His wife, Aaron, who's a lawyer, who's part of the Federalist Society, she used to clerk for John Roberts as well. This is how they met. And when it comes to anti-abortion, these two, they're the power couple. You gotta give it to Josh Holley's wife who's a lawyer by the way.

She helped overturn Roe v. Wade. Today, she was at it again. This time, arguing against the abortion appeal. Mifra Priston. Because of corruption and money, this is how this case in Texas made its way to the Supreme Court. A federal judge who first oversaw this case and whose name is Matthew Tasmeric. He's an extremely far-right judge who was nominated by Trump. He's all about role and bad reproductive rights and LGBTQ plus rights. This is the biggest abortion case since Roe v. Wade, a group who brought this case to the judge. One of the lawyers, their name was Aaron Holley. Josh Holley's wife. Why was Ms. Holley so confident that this case will go all the way up to the Supreme Court? And it has something to do with donations? Let's do the math. Trump first nominated the judge Matthew in 2017, but it went nowhere. In 2018, at Judge, he donated to Josh Holley's Senate campaign. Early 2019, Josh Holley was sworn in. And Joan of 2019, that judge Matthew, who was confirmed by the Senate. Months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

Mr. Josh Hawley, born December 31st, 1979, his family would soon after move to Lexington, Missouri, because of all the Lexingtons in the world to choose from with why not Missouri. Despite living his entire life in those square states in the middle that nobody can pick out on a map, he was fortunate enough to be born into money. Daddy was a well-to-do banker and sent him to prep school in Kansas City, where he really honed in on that douchey rich kid personality. The kind that makes that little voice in your head ask if you know punching a child is really that bad. During his prep school years, he wrote columns for the local newspaper, where he denounced affirmative action. Wrote a whole column defending right-wing extremist groups right after Timothy McVeigh did the thing he did. Then he'd go on to get his BA in history from Stanford. One can only assume because he wanted to deep-dive into what would have made 1930s Germany just a little bit more successful. Then he'd go on to get his juris doctor from Yale, and spend some time working for the Beckett Fund for Religious Liberty. There's basically a bunch of religious nuts who also happen to be lawyers and spend their time lobbying the Supreme Court to make us a theocracy. Then sometimes a faculty member for Blackstone Legal Fellowship, just like a training summer camp that teaches lawyers how to force their religious beliefs on gay people and women. In 2016, he would go on to run for a Attorney General of Missouri, or David Humphries, or Rich CEO, would spend $4.4 million of his own money to buy the election for Holly. The first things he did as a Attorney General was choose to not prosecute Sheriff Cory Hutchinson, and the officers involved in tasing and beating a mentally ill-maned death in jail, which they did because they didn't have any reason to hold Tory Sanders, this mentally ill man, and he didn't want to leave because he was scared. You got annoyed that he wouldn't leave, they just pepper sprayed him and beat him until he died of excited delirium, which is a completely made-up thing not recognized by anybody in the psychiatric field, but often used by cops who don't want to admit that they beat tays and pepper sprayed people to death while they were in custody. How were we supposed to know that beating somebody nearly to death would make them so excited they might actually die? So not off to a great start, but his next big move as AG would be going after Big Pharma, like Pfizer, for their roles in the opioid epidemic. So that wasn't such a bad thing, you know? And then when the Columbia, Missouri, and in a huge expose on Missouri, ignoring the problem of rape and having a huge backlog of untested rape kits, all the order to not it of those rape kits and found that there was 5,000 untested, many investigated Google for violating any trust and consumer protection laws. Oh, maybe he's starting to come around or redemption might be possible. But then there was that whole scandal with Eric Gritons, the Missouri governor, like misusing public funds and then having it affair and blackmailing the woman to keep it quiet. And at first, Holly absolutely refused to investigate it, and then he got a whole bunch of heat for that. So he's like, okay, I'll investigate it. And he's like, eh, I looked into it. There's nothing there, you know? And then once the evidence became so overwhelming, it couldn't be ignored. And he stepped down. Holly was like, yeah, that's good enough. We don't need to charge him with a felony, you know? And then in 2018, a bunch of Republican states got together again to have another lawsuit again about the Affordable Care Act being unconstitutional again. And of course, it would fail again. Holly was all too excited to jump on board with that. And then later that year, Bobby Bostick would come in the news for appealing his sentencing of 241 years for robbery at the age of 16. A sentence that violated a Supreme Court ruling that stated that miners could not be sent into life for charges less than homicide. And Josh came out to publicly defend the sentence. As a result, Bobby is still in prison today and will be for the rest of his life, for committing robbery at 16 years old. Something Josh Holly feels is an absolutely appropriate punishment. So don't worry, guys, your gut wasn't wrong. He's still a piece of shit. At this time, Holly was also running for Senate. And he decided that he would use a state staff as his personal campaign staff, which is illegal. And because he was attorney general, he knew that that was illegal. So he covered it up, which is, you know, also illegal. For this, the attorney general's office was fine $12,000. Where's that wrist? I'm feeling a little sloppy. Anyway, after being endorsed by the Bronze or Cat, he went on to win his senatorial race almost a year after he was sworn in as attorney general, and after criticizing other politicians for for ladder climbing and not spending enough time in their in their first elected position. He said, but no, guys, it's different for me because I didn't plan on running for Senate when I was running for attorney general. Just just kind of happened. I just sort of fell into being a senator, you know, by accident, up to sea. And then immediately after getting elected, an inquiry was opened into him, misappropriating public funds during his campaign. And since then, he's taken all the worst parts about Mitch McConnell and all the worst parts about Ted Cruz and just mashed them together and is like, that's the senator I want to be. Doing things like being the only senator to vote against a bill amendment to investigate anti-Asian hate crime. And openly admitting shit like he thinks government should be guided by scripture. And being the only senator to vote against Sweden and Finland joining NATO because China. That's literally his only reason is they shouldn't join because China is a threat. In that same vein, we shouldn't support Ukraine and they also shouldn't be allowed to join NATO because China also went on a really big anti-Semitic rant about the cosmopolitan agenda. Then when it was pointed out that Joseph Stalin used the same cosmopolitan terminology as anti-Semitic rhetoric. He's like, oh no, you guys just don't read an internet. What? Willie, because like anybody else talks about the cosmopolitan elites. This is a good one on human trafficking. Joshy Washchuk's Holly says that it's only a problem because of the sexual revolution of the 1960s and premarital sex and contraception. Oh, and Hollywood. If everybody else was just like him where they got married and only banged their wife, those three times she got drunk enough to tolerate being touched by him, human trafficking wouldn't be a thing. And I mean, obviously that makes total sense. Sexually repressed married men never get caught paying for sex or sleeping with minors. I'm sure everybody on Epstein's client list was single. He still looks like he's 13 and I still want to punch him in the throw and that is just just fucking with my head a little bit. In a weird moment of him not being a horrible human being, he teamed up with Bernie Sanders to fight for those $1200 COVID checks we got. So I guess not not all bad credit where it's due. Then 2020 happened and he went off the rails like Norfolk's other. He's the first senator to object to certifying the election result. Blabbered on and on about baseless election fraud claims like he was a pillow salesman on a coke vendor. He got so annoying with the election fraud bullshit that even Walmart tweeted telling him to shut the fuck up hashtags or loser. Some protesters getting fed up with him trying to subvert democracy went to his house and held a protest in the form of a candlelight vigil. Now when they left they left him a copy of the constitution in case you know he ever felt like maybe reading it and he had a full blown meltdown. A temper tantrum fit for that toddler face he's got. Saying oh that scumbag antifa came to my house and vandalized it and threatened my family. And then when the vana virginia police were asked about this horrific vandalism of a senator's house they're like uh sure what what he's talking about. I mean they they wrote in chalk on the sidewalk out front but that that's not technically vandalism. I don't know they seemed pretty peaceful to us. We didn't we didn't think it was that big of a deal. And then January 6th happens. Holly runs out to salute the trees and tribe and hold up his white power fist. And at some point during his cheering on sedition it dawned on him that these are just a bunch of mouth-breathing troglodytes who probably don't have any fucking clue who he actually is. And these people do only have the hard drive space to remember like three people in Washington and they reserve that space for Donald Trump Hillary Clinton and Hunter Biden's laptop. So at a certain point like Ralph from the Simpsons he thought to himself I'm in danger. And then there's security footage of him running away like a little bitch. The kind of little bitch who would think that sidewalk chalk is vandalism. After this he started to get hated by pretty much everybody. John Danforth went on to say that mentoring Holly was the worst mistake of his entire life. Yale said that he should be disbarred. Airbnb AT&T Mastercard Best Buy American Express and a few others all pulled their funding from him. Hallmark literally asked him to give their contributions to his campaign back. Most people would be like you know maybe maybe have crossed a line. But by Golly Holly was not going to be dissuaded by you know Democrats or Republicans or the voters the media or his colleagues or his mentors or his teachers or a sense of decency or morals or pride or values. He used the opportunity of being persecuted by the cancel culture to fundraise, to fight back against cancel culture. Can you get any more cancel culture than trying to cancel democracy because it hurts your feelings? Anyway since then he's written a TikTok band that sucks so much it got blocked by the senate. Otherwise has just been obstructionist for the sake of being obstructionist which means he doesn't really accomplish anything. So he continues to just whine about election fraud, vote against everybody who hurts his feats and masturbate every night to pictures of Donald Trump because his wife probably sleeps in a completely different house. Yeah he is just one of many many glaring examples of why Missouri should not be allowed to make decisions on anything. Seriously Missouri you are just very clearly not okay lately. I think we need you to to turn in your senators and your representatives and just work on you guys for a while. Take some personal days. Maybe a vacation, take some time, read a book if you haven't burned them all already. Maybe take your child bride to Chuck E. Cheese for date night. I don't know just go take some time, get your head right and don't worry. We've got everything over here handled just go away.",subjective,political corruption

Nice to see you again. When you were here last, I talked with you about the fact that more than 130 officials in the Energy Department reported more than 2,700 trades of shares, bonds, and options and companies that ethics officers said was directly related to the agency's work. This is institutionalized corruption. And I asked you, Point Blank, do you own any individual stock? And you told me, no, let's just look at it. There's not a difficult question. Do you own individual stocks, Madam Secretary? You said no. In fact, you repeated it three times to me. No, no, no. Turns out that was false. You did own multiple individual stocks. And you neglected to report it to this committee for months afterwards. Why did you mislead this committee? Oh, my goodness. That was exactly my response. So why did you mislead this committee? I believed that I had sold all individual stocks. And I was incorrect. So I came back and told you just don't know the portfolio. Pretty much. It's a big one, I guess, huh? No, it's extremely small. Apparently not. Someone manages it for you. So I came back as soon as I found out that in fact I had not sold all individuals. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, that's not true either. Let's just look at the timeline. Let's not, I just remind you, you're under oath. As a secretary, you testified, you didn't own any individual stocks. You didn't sell the stocks for a whole other month. And after you sold the stocks, you waited another month before you informed this committee. Why did you mislead us? And what were you hiding? Why did you wait so long? Why did you hide this? I did not hide it because I brought it forth to the committee when I realized that we had made a mistake. Really? What explains the delay? Why did you wait for a full month to explain your actions to this committee, your false testimony? That's less than a month. And I sent a letter explaining what had happened. May the 15th to the 9th. May the 15th to the 9th. Are we going to... I owned a Ford stock that was... You mislead this committee and you wait, what were the stocks? What were the stocks that you owned? It was a Ford stock that my husband had owned since he was very young. And I just was not aware of it. And what were the others? You sold six stocks, what were the other five? I sold non-conflicting stocks. What were they? I don't honestly, I don't even know. I do know they're a Ford one because that was a conflict. That's why I wrote this. You're here before this committee a year later after actively misleading to us, after denying and delaying and delaying. And now you won't tell us. Is one of them Protera? No. You said on the board of directors at Protera, you made millions in end reports and stock options at Protera. And then you promoted Protera stock and Protera products as energy secretary. Was that one of the stocks that you sold? This is so... I mean, really? Was that one of the stocks you sold? No. Yes, really. You are presiding over institutionalized corruption in your energy department. You have violated the stock act nine separate times. You have been referred by the Inspector General for violations of the Hatch Act. It is institutionalized corruption that you are now the face of. And here's what I'm trying to figure out. I just want to know who really runs the energy department. Is it you? Or is it the mega corporations who stock that you own that you're making profits at? Oh my goodness. Or maybe it's the foreign billionaires who fund your conferences. Let's try something else. Do you know the names of the foreign billionaires who fund the conferences you go to? Since you don't know the stocks, do you know the names of the foreign billionaires? This is unbelievable to me. Let me help you. One of them is Hatch Org Wice, a Swiss billionaire who has used various dark money front groups. I do not know what you are talking about. Who funnel various dark money's front groups to funnel foreign money into American politics. He has used the Berger Action Fund, 20 million dollars, that then sent money to the fund for a better future, that then sent money to the climate power group that has funded conferences you've attended. Do you know who this is? Do you think it's a good idea to know who that is? I have no idea which is not. I have no idea what you're talking about. You don't know the stocks, you don't know the billionaires, you would take no responsibility. In short, meanwhile, your energy department executives in your energy department are trading stocks and companies that they have direct oversight over and you work too. That is incorrect. Nobody in the department of energy and we have a strong ethics office does not trade stocks in anything that they have oversight over. That is not true. It is not true. The Wall Street Journal has reported on this. If I may. If I may, Senator, if I may just ask the question, is it possible that maybe we can continue this at a later time, but if you had any questions on the energy direct energy policies? Mr. Chairman, this is directly relevant to institutionalized corruption in the department of energy that she oversees. You are, I think, about to say that the Wall Street Journal reports wrong. The Wall Street Journal report did not say that people over whom they were in areas where they were directly overseeing head stocks. They did not. Our ethics office consults with all of our employees that have a recording requirement about their stock holdings. They do not own stocks in areas that they have any influence over nor do I. Madam Secretary, all I have to say is this record is just deplorable. It is despicable. It is outrageous that hundreds of officers in the energy department are trading shares. It is outrageous that you misled us. It is outrageous that you are continuing to mislead us. It is outrageous you're going to conferences and events funded by foreign billionaires using dark money to try to influence our politics. This has got to change. And frankly, you should go.

He doesn't give direct answers because he's an invertebrate. IZ wrote in on one crucial question. His website stated that he didn't believe government funds should not be used to pay for any abortions, and he was getting a lot of mileage out of that as well. So I pointed out, since he was supposed to know the law, especially running for attorney general, I pointed out that our government has something that's known as the Hyde Amendment, specifically states that tax dollars will not be used to pay for abortions except for the event of medical necessity for the mother's life or rape or incest. So I point blank asked him, does this mean that you believe a victim of rape should be forced to give birth? At that point, he decided it was time to leave, and he cut everything short. I said, I'm not going to let this go, Mr. Holley. You need to answer this question. And he did the typical politician thing and tried to shake my hands. It was really good meeting you. It was nice talking with you. I got to go. I chased him out of the restaurant. We weren't running, but it wasn't far from it because he was power walking. I mean, he was one of those mall walkers who just had a big cup of coffee. He was zipping right out there, and I asked him loudly. I said, are you saying that a rape victim should be forced to give birth? And he just acted like he didn't hear me. So yeah, this whole entire time, I've been saying Josh Holley is a piece of garbage. He does not represent the Missouri that I know. He's a self-serving jellyfish of a man. And I think he's a piece of garbage. And at this point, I wouldn't be surprised if he's a Russian asset. I mean, really.

Let's not mince words, they've been sold into slavery. When kids are being put into factories, forced to work overnight, forced to work in terrible conditions, they're not getting paid, they're not going to school, sometimes they're not getting fed, that's slavery. And what I heard from Secretary of New Yorkists, don't take my word for it, you go look at the record, read the transcript. What he told me was, oh, it's not my problem. We don't need anything to do with it. Not my problem. Now we have a new report from HHS, where they say, it's not their problem. Amazing how this works. Nobody's responsible. These kids are literally being sold as slaves in the United States of America in the year 2023 and nobody's responsible. They don't want to come and testify to this committee. You bet they don't. They don't want to be put under oath. They don't want to answer any questions. They don't want cameras here. They don't want to take any responsibility. Well, I tell you, it's somebody's fault. It's not the kids fault. Thank God for the New York Times, phrase I never thought would come out of my mouth. But really, I mean, thank the Lord that the New York Times did these series of reports, because otherwise we'd still be fed the lies, from this administration that everything is fine and dandy. We know just where the kids are. It's all great. They're all fine. No, it's not. Is it fine that people like Carolina Yuck, who's 15 years old, I apologize to her if I mispronounced her name. She's one of the folks, one of the young women that the New York Times caught up with. What is she doing? Midnight in Grand Rapids, Michigan, a conveyor belt carrying bags of Cheerios, past the cluster of young workers. Carolina every 10 seconds have to stuff a sealed plastic bag of cereal into a passing yellow carton. It's dangerous work, fast moving polies and gears that it torn off fingers and ripped open a woman's scalp. The factory was full of underage workers like Carolina who crossed the southern border by themselves, vulnerable. Now spending late nights, bent over hazardous machinery and violation of child labor laws. Carolina says sometimes I get tired and feel sick. Her stomach often hurt. She was unsure if that was because of the lack of sleep, the stress from the incestant roar of the machines or the worries she had for herself and her family in Guatemala. This is totally, utterly, completely unacceptable. And I am sick unto death of this administration coming before this Congress and saying, it's not our fault, we have nothing to do with it. We don't know where they are. The kids are fine, somebody will do it, somebody will get around to it, ridiculous. Let's look at some of the things that we've learned about what's going on over at HHS that Secretary Bacera is doing. Here's some quotes from employees at HHS. At least five health and human services staff members said that they were pushed out after raising concerns about child safety. This is all from the New York Times, by the way. Mr. Bacera told the Office of Refugee Resettlement Director that if she could not increase the number of discharges of children, he'd find somebody who would. Next, 20% of kids have to be released every week or you get dinged. It's a conveyor belt of children being forced through the system and what's the priority of HHS? Just get them out as fast as we can. They go to factories, they go to slave labor, no. I've written in the FBI and asked the FBI, where are the 80,000 plus children? This administration's lost. They don't know. I've said it's your responsibility to go get them. It's a direct violation of child labor laws. They're not doing anything. Nobody's doing anything. It's outrageous. It's absolutely outrageous. And the fact that the administration",subjective,child labor

That if Henry Ford had run his plants like this he would never have become famous and rich. This is not the way you do an assembly line.

Do you think that this is acceptable to run to run O.R. like an assembly line and to release these children? I prefer you to not run O.R. like an assembly line. The safety and well-being of children is our top concern. Plainly it is not your top concern because you have managed to lose 85,000 of them and they're with labor traffickers. How many are you in regular contact with right now? I don't have the specific number. How can you not know? Why would you come to this hearing and not know? Respectfully.

Mr. Josh Hawley, born December 31st, 1979, his family would soon after move to Lexington, Missouri, because of all the Lexingtons in the world to choose from with why not Missouri. Despite living his entire life in those square states in the middle that nobody can pick out on a map, he was fortunate enough to be born into money. Daddy was a well-to-do banker and sent him to prep school in Kansas City, where he really honed in on that douchey rich kid personality. The kind that makes that little voice in your head ask if you know punching a child is really that bad. During his prep school years, he wrote columns for the local newspaper, where he denounced affirmative action. Wrote a whole column defending right-wing extremist groups right after Timothy McVeigh did the thing he did. Then he'd go on to get his BA in history from Stanford. One can only assume because he wanted to deep-dive into what would have made 1930s Germany just a little bit more successful. Then he'd go on to get his juris doctor from Yale, and spend some time working for the Beckett Fund for Religious Liberty. There's basically a bunch of religious nuts who also happen to be lawyers and spend their time lobbying the Supreme Court to make us a theocracy. Then sometimes a faculty member for Blackstone Legal Fellowship, just like a training summer camp that teaches lawyers how to force their religious beliefs on gay people and women. In 2016, he would go on to run for a Attorney General of Missouri, or David Humphries, or Rich CEO, would spend $4.4 million of his own money to buy the election for Holly. The first things he did as a Attorney General was choose to not prosecute Sheriff Cory Hutchinson, and the officers involved in tasing and beating a mentally ill-maned death in jail, which they did because they didn't have any reason to hold Tory Sanders, this mentally ill man, and he didn't want to leave because he was scared. You got annoyed that he wouldn't leave, they just pepper sprayed him and beat him until he died of excited delirium, which is a completely made-up thing not recognized by anybody in the psychiatric field, but often used by cops who don't want to admit that they beat tays and pepper sprayed people to death while they were in custody. How were we supposed to know that beating somebody nearly to death would make them so excited they might actually die? So not off to a great start, but his next big move as AG would be going after Big Pharma, like Pfizer, for their roles in the opioid epidemic. So that wasn't such a bad thing, you know? And then when the Columbia, Missouri, and in a huge expose on Missouri, ignoring the problem of rape and having a huge backlog of untested rape kits, all the order to not it of those rape kits and found that there was 5,000 untested, many investigated Google for violating any trust and consumer protection laws. Oh, maybe he's starting to come around or redemption might be possible. But then there was that whole scandal with Eric Gritons, the Missouri governor, like misusing public funds and then having it affair and blackmailing the woman to keep it quiet. And at first, Holly absolutely refused to investigate it, and then he got a whole bunch of heat for that. So he's like, okay, I'll investigate it. And he's like, eh, I looked into it. There's nothing there, you know? And then once the evidence became so overwhelming, it couldn't be ignored. And he stepped down. Holly was like, yeah, that's good enough. We don't need to charge him with a felony, you know? And then in 2018, a bunch of Republican states got together again to have another lawsuit again about the Affordable Care Act being unconstitutional again. And of course, it would fail again. Holly was all too excited to jump on board with that. And then later that year, Bobby Bostick would come in the news for appealing his sentencing of 241 years for robbery at the age of 16. A sentence that violated a Supreme Court ruling that stated that miners could not be sent into life for charges less than homicide. And Josh came out to publicly defend the sentence. As a result, Bobby is still in prison today and will be for the rest of his life, for committing robbery at 16 years old. Something Josh Holly feels is an absolutely appropriate punishment. So don't worry, guys, your gut wasn't wrong. He's still a piece of shit. At this time, Holly was also running for Senate. And he decided that he would use a state staff as his personal campaign staff, which is illegal. And because he was attorney general, he knew that that was illegal. So he covered it up, which is, you know, also illegal. For this, the attorney general's office was fine $12,000. Where's that wrist? I'm feeling a little sloppy. Anyway, after being endorsed by the Bronze or Cat, he went on to win his senatorial race almost a year after he was sworn in as attorney general, and after criticizing other politicians for for ladder climbing and not spending enough time in their in their first elected position. He said, but no, guys, it's different for me because I didn't plan on running for Senate when I was running for attorney general. Just just kind of happened. I just sort of fell into being a senator, you know, by accident, up to sea. And then immediately after getting elected, an inquiry was opened into him, misappropriating public funds during his campaign. And since then, he's taken all the worst parts about Mitch McConnell and all the worst parts about Ted Cruz and just mashed them together and is like, that's the senator I want to be. Doing things like being the only senator to vote against a bill amendment to investigate anti-Asian hate crime. And openly admitting shit like he thinks government should be guided by scripture. And being the only senator to vote against Sweden and Finland joining NATO because China. That's literally his only reason is they shouldn't join because China is a threat. In that same vein, we shouldn't support Ukraine and they also shouldn't be allowed to join NATO because China also went on a really big anti-Semitic rant about the cosmopolitan agenda. Then when it was pointed out that Joseph Stalin used the same cosmopolitan terminology as anti-Semitic rhetoric. He's like, oh no, you guys just don't read an internet. What? Willie, because like anybody else talks about the cosmopolitan elites. This is a good one on human trafficking. Joshy Washchuk's Holly says that it's only a problem because of the sexual revolution of the 1960s and premarital sex and contraception. Oh, and Hollywood. If everybody else was just like him where they got married and only banged their wife, those three times she got drunk enough to tolerate being touched by him, human trafficking wouldn't be a thing. And I mean, obviously that makes total sense. Sexually repressed married men never get caught paying for sex or sleeping with minors. I'm sure everybody on Epstein's client list was single. He still looks like he's 13 and I still want to punch him in the throw and that is just just fucking with my head a little bit. In a weird moment of him not being a horrible human being, he teamed up with Bernie Sanders to fight for those $1200 COVID checks we got. So I guess not not all bad credit where it's due. Then 2020 happened and he went off the rails like Norfolk's other. He's the first senator to object to certifying the election result. Blabbered on and on about baseless election fraud claims like he was a pillow salesman on a coke vendor. He got so annoying with the election fraud bullshit that even Walmart tweeted telling him to shut the fuck up hashtags or loser. Some protesters getting fed up with him trying to subvert democracy went to his house and held a protest in the form of a candlelight vigil. Now when they left they left him a copy of the constitution in case you know he ever felt like maybe reading it and he had a full blown meltdown. A temper tantrum fit for that toddler face he's got. Saying oh that scumbag antifa came to my house and vandalized it and threatened my family. And then when the vana virginia police were asked about this horrific vandalism of a senator's house they're like uh sure what what he's talking about. I mean they they wrote in chalk on the sidewalk out front but that that's not technically vandalism. I don't know they seemed pretty peaceful to us. We didn't we didn't think it was that big of a deal. And then January 6th happens. Holly runs out to salute the trees and tribe and hold up his white power fist. And at some point during his cheering on sedition it dawned on him that these are just a bunch of mouth-breathing troglodytes who probably don't have any fucking clue who he actually is. And these people do only have the hard drive space to remember like three people in Washington and they reserve that space for Donald Trump Hillary Clinton and Hunter Biden's laptop. So at a certain point like Ralph from the Simpsons he thought to himself I'm in danger. And then there's security footage of him running away like a little bitch. The kind of little bitch who would think that sidewalk chalk is vandalism. After this he started to get hated by pretty much everybody. John Danforth went on to say that mentoring Holly was the worst mistake of his entire life. Yale said that he should be disbarred. Airbnb AT&T Mastercard Best Buy American Express and a few others all pulled their funding from him. Hallmark literally asked him to give their contributions to his campaign back. Most people would be like you know maybe maybe have crossed a line. But by Golly Holly was not going to be dissuaded by you know Democrats or Republicans or the voters the media or his colleagues or his mentors or his teachers or a sense of decency or morals or pride or values. He used the opportunity of being persecuted by the cancel culture to fundraise, to fight back against cancel culture. Can you get any more cancel culture than trying to cancel democracy because it hurts your feelings? Anyway since then he's written a TikTok band that sucks so much it got blocked by the senate. Otherwise has just been obstructionist for the sake of being obstructionist which means he doesn't really accomplish anything. So he continues to just whine about election fraud, vote against everybody who hurts his feats and masturbate every night to pictures of Donald Trump because his wife probably sleeps in a completely different house. Yeah he is just one of many many glaring examples of why Missouri should not be allowed to make decisions on anything. Seriously Missouri you are just very clearly not okay lately. I think we need you to to turn in your senators and your representatives and just work on you guys for a while. Take some personal days. Maybe a vacation, take some time, read a book if you haven't burned them all already. Maybe take your child bride to Chuck E. Cheese for date night. I don't know just go take some time, get your head right and don't worry. We've got everything over here handled just go away.",subjective,political corruption

Nice to see you again. When you were here last, I talked with you about the fact that more than 130 officials in the Energy Department reported more than 2,700 trades of shares, bonds, and options and companies that ethics officers said was directly related to the agency's work. This is institutionalized corruption. And I asked you, Point Blank, do you own any individual stock? And you told me, no, let's just look at it. There's not a difficult question. Do you own individual stocks, Madam Secretary? You said no. In fact, you repeated it three times to me. No, no, no. Turns out that was false. You did own multiple individual stocks. And you neglected to report it to this committee for months afterwards. Why did you mislead this committee? Oh, my goodness. That was exactly my response. So why did you mislead this committee? I believed that I had sold all individual stocks. And I was incorrect. So I came back and told you just don't know the portfolio. Pretty much. It's a big one, I guess, huh? No, it's extremely small. Apparently not. Someone manages it for you. So I came back as soon as I found out that in fact I had not sold all individuals. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, that's not true either. Let's just look at the timeline. Let's not, I just remind you, you're under oath. As a secretary, you testified, you didn't own any individual stocks. You didn't sell the stocks for a whole other month. And after you sold the stocks, you waited another month before you informed this committee. Why did you mislead us? And what were you hiding? Why did you wait so long? Why did you hide this? I did not hide it because I brought it forth to the committee when I realized that we had made a mistake. Really? What explains the delay? Why did you wait for a full month to explain your actions to this committee, your false testimony? That's less than a month. And I sent a letter explaining what had happened. May the 15th to the 9th. May the 15th to the 9th. Are we going to... I owned a Ford stock that was... You mislead this committee and you wait, what were the stocks? What were the stocks that you owned? It was a Ford stock that my husband had owned since he was very young. And I just was not aware of it. And what were the others? You sold six stocks, what were the other five? I sold non-conflicting stocks. What were they? I don't honestly, I don't even know. I do know they're a Ford one because that was a conflict. That's why I wrote this. You're here before this committee a year later after actively misleading to us, after denying and delaying and delaying. And now you won't tell us. Is one of them Protera? No. You said on the board of directors at Protera, you made millions in end reports and stock options at Protera. And then you promoted Protera stock and Protera products as energy secretary. Was that one of the stocks that you sold? This is so... I mean, really? Was that one of the stocks you sold? No. Yes, really. You are presiding over institutionalized corruption in your energy department. You have violated the stock act nine separate times. You have been referred by the Inspector General for violations of the Hatch Act. It is institutionalized corruption that you are now the face of. And here's what I'm trying to figure out. I just want to know who really runs the energy department. Is it you? Or is it the mega corporations who stock that you own that you're making profits at? Oh my goodness. Or maybe it's the foreign billionaires who fund your conferences. Let's try something else. Do you know the names of the foreign billionaires who fund the conferences you go to? Since you don't know the stocks, do you know the names of the foreign billionaires? This is unbelievable to me. Let me help you. One of them is Hatch Org Wice, a Swiss billionaire who has used various dark money front groups. I do not know what you are talking about. Who funnel various dark money's front groups to funnel foreign money into American politics. He has used the Berger Action Fund, 20 million dollars, that then sent money to the fund for a better future, that then sent money to the climate power group that has funded conferences you've attended. Do you know who this is? Do you think it's a good idea to know who that is? I have no idea which is not. I have no idea what you're talking about. You don't know the stocks, you don't know the billionaires, you would take no responsibility. In short, meanwhile, your energy department executives in your energy department are trading stocks and companies that they have direct oversight over and you work too. That is incorrect. Nobody in the department of energy and we have a strong ethics office does not trade stocks in anything that they have oversight over. That is not true. It is not true. The Wall Street Journal has reported on this. If I may. If I may, Senator, if I may just ask the question, is it possible that maybe we can continue this at a later time, but if you had any questions on the energy direct energy policies? Mr. Chairman, this is directly relevant to institutionalized corruption in the department of energy that she oversees. You are, I think, about to say that the Wall Street Journal reports wrong. The Wall Street Journal report did not say that people over whom they were in areas where they were directly overseeing head stocks. They did not. Our ethics office consults with all of our employees that have a recording requirement about their stock holdings. They do not own stocks in areas that they have any influence over nor do I. Madam Secretary, all I have to say is this record is just deplorable. It is despicable. It is outrageous that hundreds of officers in the energy department are trading shares. It is outrageous that you misled us. It is outrageous that you are continuing to mislead us. It is outrageous you're going to conferences and events funded by foreign billionaires using dark money to try to influence our politics. This has got to change. And frankly, you should go.

He doesn't give direct answers because he's an invertebrate. IZ wrote in on one crucial question. His website stated that he didn't believe government funds should not be used to pay for any abortions, and he was getting a lot of mileage out of that as well. So I pointed out, since he was supposed to know the law, especially running for attorney general, I pointed out that our government has something that's known as the Hyde Amendment, specifically states that tax dollars will not be used to pay for abortions except for the event of medical necessity for the mother's life or rape or incest. So I point blank asked him, does this mean that you believe a victim of rape should be forced to give birth? At that point, he decided it was time to leave, and he cut everything short. I said, I'm not going to let this go, Mr. Holley. You need to answer this question. And he did the typical politician thing and tried to shake my hands. It was really good meeting you. It was nice talking with you. I got to go. I chased him out of the restaurant. We weren't running, but it wasn't far from it because he was power walking. I mean, he was one of those mall walkers who just had a big cup of coffee. He was zipping right out there, and I asked him loudly. I said, are you saying that a rape victim should be forced to give birth? And he just acted like he didn't hear me. So yeah, this whole entire time, I've been saying Josh Holley is a piece of garbage. He does not represent the Missouri that I know. He's a self-serving jellyfish of a man. And I think he's a piece of garbage. And at this point, I wouldn't be surprised if he's a Russian asset. I mean, really.

Let's not mince words, they've been sold into slavery. When kids are being put into factories, forced to work overnight, forced to work in terrible conditions, they're not getting paid, they're not going to school, sometimes they're not getting fed, that's slavery. And what I heard from Secretary of New Yorkists, don't take my word for it, you go look at the record, read the transcript. What he told me was, oh, it's not my problem. We don't need anything to do with it. Not my problem. Now we have a new report from HHS, where they say, it's not their problem. Amazing how this works. Nobody's responsible. These kids are literally being sold as slaves in the United States of America in the year 2023 and nobody's responsible. They don't want to come and testify to this committee. You bet they don't. They don't want to be put under oath. They don't want to answer any questions. They don't want cameras here. They don't want to take any responsibility. Well, I tell you, it's somebody's fault. It's not the kids fault. Thank God for the New York Times, phrase I never thought would come out of my mouth. But really, I mean, thank the Lord that the New York Times did these series of reports, because otherwise we'd still be fed the lies, from this administration that everything is fine and dandy. We know just where the kids are. It's all great. They're all fine. No, it's not. Is it fine that people like Carolina Yuck, who's 15 years old, I apologize to her if I mispronounced her name. She's one of the folks, one of the young women that the New York Times caught up with. What is she doing? Midnight in Grand Rapids, Michigan, a conveyor belt carrying bags of Cheerios, past the cluster of young workers. Carolina every 10 seconds have to stuff a sealed plastic bag of cereal into a passing yellow carton. It's dangerous work, fast moving polies and gears that it torn off fingers and ripped open a woman's scalp. The factory was full of underage workers like Carolina who crossed the southern border by themselves, vulnerable. Now spending late nights, bent over hazardous machinery and violation of child labor laws. Carolina says sometimes I get tired and feel sick. Her stomach often hurt. She was unsure if that was because of the lack of sleep, the stress from the incestant roar of the machines or the worries she had for herself and her family in Guatemala. This is totally, utterly, completely unacceptable. And I am sick unto death of this administration coming before this Congress and saying, it's not our fault, we have nothing to do with it. We don't know where they are. The kids are fine, somebody will do it, somebody will get around to it, ridiculous. Let's look at some of the things that we've learned about what's going on over at HHS that Secretary Bacera is doing. Here's some quotes from employees at HHS. At least five health and human services staff members said that they were pushed out after raising concerns about child safety. This is all from the New York Times, by the way. Mr. Bacera told the Office of Refugee Resettlement Director that if she could not increase the number of discharges of children, he'd find somebody who would. Next, 20% of kids have to be released every week or you get dinged. It's a conveyor belt of children being forced through the system and what's the priority of HHS? Just get them out as fast as we can. They go to factories, they go to slave labor, no. I've written in the FBI and asked the FBI, where are the 80,000 plus children? This administration's lost. They don't know. I've said it's your responsibility to go get them. It's a direct violation of child labor laws. They're not doing anything. Nobody's doing anything. It's outrageous. It's absolutely outrageous. And the fact that the administration",subjective,child labor

She helped overturn Roe v. Wade. Today, she was at it again. This time, arguing against the abortion appeal. Mifra Priston. Because of corruption and money, this is how this case in Texas made its way to the Supreme Court. A federal judge who first oversaw this case and whose name is Matthew Tasmeric. He's an extremely far-right judge who was nominated by Trump. He's all about role and bad reproductive rights and LGBTQ plus rights. This is the biggest abortion case since Roe v. Wade, a group who brought this case to the judge. One of the lawyers, their name was Aaron Holley. Josh Holley's wife. Why was Ms. Holley so confident that this case will go all the way up to the Supreme Court? And it has something to do with donations? Let's do the math. Trump first nominated the judge Matthew in 2017, but it went nowhere. In 2018, at Judge, he donated to Josh Holley's Senate campaign. Early 2019, Josh Holley was sworn in. And Joan of 2019, that judge Matthew, who was confirmed by the Senate. Months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

Nice to see you again. When you were here last, I talked with you about the fact that more than 130 officials in the Energy Department reported more than 2,700 trades of shares, bonds, and options and companies that ethics officers said was directly related to the agency's work. This is institutionalized corruption. And I asked you, Point Blank, do you own any individual stock? And you told me, no, let's just look at it. There's not a difficult question. Do you own individual stocks, Madam Secretary? You said no. In fact, you repeated it three times to me. No, no, no. Turns out that was false. You did own multiple individual stocks. And you neglected to report it to this committee for months afterwards. Why did you mislead this committee? Oh, my goodness. That was exactly my response. So why did you mislead this committee? I believed that I had sold all individual stocks. And I was incorrect. So I came back and told you just don't know the portfolio. Pretty much. It's a big one, I guess, huh? No, it's extremely small. Apparently not. Someone manages it for you. So I came back as soon as I found out that in fact I had not sold all individuals. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, that's not true either. Let's just look at the timeline. Let's not, I just remind you, you're under oath. As a secretary, you testified, you didn't own any individual stocks. You didn't sell the stocks for a whole other month. And after you sold the stocks, you waited another month before you informed this committee. Why did you mislead us? And what were you hiding? Why did you wait so long? Why did you hide this? I did not hide it because I brought it forth to the committee when I realized that we had made a mistake. Really? What explains the delay? Why did you wait for a full month to explain your actions to this committee, your false testimony? That's less than a month. And I sent a letter explaining what had happened. May the 15th to the 9th. May the 15th to the 9th. Are we going to... I owned a Ford stock that was... You mislead this committee and you wait, what were the stocks? What were the stocks that you owned? It was a Ford stock that my husband had owned since he was very young. And I just was not aware of it. And what were the others? You sold six stocks, what were the other five? I sold non-conflicting stocks. What were they? I don't honestly, I don't even know. I do know they're a Ford one because that was a conflict. That's why I wrote this. You're here before this committee a year later after actively misleading to us, after denying and delaying and delaying. And now you won't tell us. Is one of them Protera? No. You said on the board of directors at Protera, you made millions in end reports and stock options at Protera. And then you promoted Protera stock and Protera products as energy secretary. Was that one of the stocks that you sold? This is so... I mean, really? Was that one of the stocks you sold? No. Yes, really. You are presiding over institutionalized corruption in your energy department. You have violated the stock act nine separate times. You have been referred by the Inspector General for violations of the Hatch Act. It is institutionalized corruption that you are now the face of. And here's what I'm trying to figure out. I just want to know who really runs the energy department. Is it you? Or is it the mega corporations who stock that you own that you're making profits at? Oh my goodness. Or maybe it's the foreign billionaires who fund your conferences. Let's try something else. Do you know the names of the foreign billionaires who fund the conferences you go to? Since you don't know the stocks, do you know the names of the foreign billionaires? This is unbelievable to me. Let me help you. One of them is Hatch Org Wice, a Swiss billionaire who has used various dark money front groups. I do not know what you are talking about. Who funnel various dark money's front groups to funnel foreign money into American politics. He has used the Berger Action Fund, 20 million dollars, that then sent money to the fund for a better future, that then sent money to the climate power group that has funded conferences you've attended. Do you know who this is? Do you think it's a good idea to know who that is? I have no idea which is not. I have no idea what you're talking about. You don't know the stocks, you don't know the billionaires, you would take no responsibility. In short, meanwhile, your energy department executives in your energy department are trading stocks and companies that they have direct oversight over and you work too. That is incorrect. Nobody in the department of energy and we have a strong ethics office does not trade stocks in anything that they have oversight over. That is not true. It is not true. The Wall Street Journal has reported on this. If I may. If I may, Senator, if I may just ask the question, is it possible that maybe we can continue this at a later time, but if you had any questions on the energy direct energy policies? Mr. Chairman, this is directly relevant to institutionalized corruption in the department of energy that she oversees. You are, I think, about to say that the Wall Street Journal reports wrong. The Wall Street Journal report did not say that people over whom they were in areas where they were directly overseeing head stocks. They did not. Our ethics office consults with all of our employees that have a recording requirement about their stock holdings. They do not own stocks in areas that they have any influence over nor do I. Madam Secretary, all I have to say is this record is just deplorable. It is despicable. It is outrageous that hundreds of officers in the energy department are trading shares. It is outrageous that you misled us. It is outrageous that you are continuing to mislead us. It is outrageous you're going to conferences and events funded by foreign billionaires using dark money to try to influence our politics. This has got to change. And frankly, you should go.

His website stated that he didn't believe government funds should not be used to pay for any abortions, and he was getting a lot of mileage out of that as well. So I pointed out, since he was supposed to know the law, especially running for attorney general, I pointed out that our government has something that's known as the Hyde Amendment, specifically states that tax dollars will not be used to pay for abortions except for the event of medical necessity for the mother's life or rape or incest. So I point blank asked him, does this mean that you believe a victim of rape should be forced to give birth? At that point, he decided it was time to leave, and he cut everything short. I said, I'm not going to let this go, Mr. Holley. You need to answer this question. And he did the typical politician thing and tried to shake my hands. It was really good meeting you. It was nice talking with you. I got to go. I chased him out of the restaurant. We weren't running, but it wasn't far from it because he was power walking. I mean, he was one of those mall walkers who just had a big cup of coffee. He was zipping right out there, and I asked him loudly. I said, are you saying that a rape victim should be forced to give birth? And he just acted like he didn't hear me. So yeah, this whole entire time, I've been saying Josh Holley is a piece of garbage. He does not represent the Missouri that I know. He's a self-serving jellyfish of a man.

Let's not mince words, they've been sold into slavery. When kids are being put into factories, forced to work overnight, forced to work in terrible conditions, they're not getting paid, they're not going to school, sometimes they're not getting fed, that's slavery. And what I heard from Secretary of New Yorkists, don't take my word for it, you go look at the record, read the transcript. What he told me was, oh, it's not my problem. We don't need anything to do with it. Not my problem. Now we have a new report from HHS, where they say, it's not their problem. Amazing how this works. Nobody's responsible. These kids are literally being sold as slaves in the United States of America in the year 2023 and nobody's responsible. They don't want to come and testify to this committee. You bet they don't. They don't want to be put under oath. They don't want to answer any questions. They don't want cameras here. They don't want to take any responsibility. Well, I tell you, it's somebody's fault.

She's one of the folks, one of the young women that the New York Times caught up with. What is she doing? Midnight in Grand Rapids, Michigan, a conveyor belt carrying bags of Cheerios, past the cluster of young workers. Carolina every 10 seconds have to stuff a sealed plastic bag of cereal into a passing yellow carton. It's dangerous work, fast moving polies and gears that it torn off fingers and ripped open a woman's scalp. The factory was full of underage workers like Carolina who crossed the southern border by themselves, vulnerable. Now spending late nights, bent over hazardous machinery and violation of child labor laws. Carolina says sometimes I get tired and feel sick. Her stomach often hurt. She was unsure if that was because of the lack of sleep, the stress from the incestant roar of the machines or the worries she had for herself and her family in Guatemala. This is totally, utterly, completely unacceptable. And I am sick unto death of this administration coming before this Congress and saying, it's not our fault, we have nothing to do with it. We don't know where they are. The kids are fine, somebody will do it, somebody will get around to it, ridiculous. Let's look at some of the things that we've learned about what's going on over at HHS that Secretary Bacera is doing. Here's some quotes from employees at HHS. At least five health and human services staff members said that they were pushed out after raising concerns about child safety. This is all from the New York Times, by the way. Mr. Bacera told the Office of Refugee Resettlement Director that if she could not increase the number of discharges of children, he'd find somebody who would. Next, 20% of kids have to be released every week or you get dinged. It's a conveyor belt of children being forced through the system and what's the priority of HHS? Just get them out as fast as we can. They go to factories, they go to slave labor, no. I've written in the FBI and asked the FBI, where are the 80,000 plus children? This administration's lost. They don't know. I've said it's your responsibility to go get them. It's a direct violation of child labor laws. They're not doing anything. Nobody's doing anything. It's outrageous.

On the subject of these sweeping mandates related to electric vehicles, the Biden administration has imposed, including now for our military, the metals needed to make the lithium ion batteries in those vehicles are, of course, lithium, nickel, graphite, and cobalt. Now, can you tell me what nation is the largest producer of refined lithium in the world? No, I can't. It's China. Can you tell me which nations the largest producer of refined cobalt in the world? No, China. Do you know what nation is the largest exporter of natural graphite to the United States? Globally. No, Senator. It's China. So in all of these instances, these mandates your decision to trade off our energy security in favor of a radical climate change agenda is making us more and more dependent on China, and at the same time, you are denying mining, blocking mining, blocking permits for mines in this country that would allow us to develop nickel and copper and cobalt. Why? Why block the development of these resources in our own nation in favor of making us dependent on China? Senator, are you referring to the boundary waters? I'm referring to the Twin Meadows mine in Minnesota. I think Senator Bross was just asking about. Yes, near the boundary waters, which is iconic place, and, of course, a very valuable ecological system to many plants, animals, species. But jobs for, let me just say this though, jobs for blue-collar workers in this nation are valuable resources. The livelihood and well-being of American families are valuable resources. The ability of America to have our own industry and not be dependent on China is a valuable resource. Why should those things for millions of Americans be sacrificed in favor of your agenda for radical climate change? Senator, I know that there is like 1.9 jobs for every American in the country right now, so I know there's a lot of jobs. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, you're telling me, you're telling me we've got too many jobs in the country? Well, I'm saying that we don't have enough people. That's why we are having a hard time finding folks to work at our department. Oh, wait, you're telling me that we have too many jobs for blue-collar work? Have you seen the number of jobs we have lost in this country to China in the last 20 years? Do you know where those jobs come from? Over 3 million jobs have gone to China. Do you know where those jobs have come from? They've come out of Midwestern towns, like the ones I represent. They are blue-collar workers and you're sitting here and telling me that we have too many jobs in this country? Are you serious? Senator, we are working hard every single day. There are we have processed 20 mining applications, 20 mines or mining modification permits since January of 2021. We are moving forward. We're doing our jobs. We're fulfilling our mission for the- You're not moving forward. You're moving backward. You're shutting down and denying permits from mines in this country where we can develop our own resources. You're shutting down oil and natural gas permits. You're approving taxes and royalties that deliberately suppress American energy development in favor of a climate change agenda. And now you're sitting here and telling me, we've got too many jobs in this country. We've got gobs of jobs in this country. We don't need any more jobs in this country.

Senator, to you come to the camera. Okay, very quickly. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Not to interrupt the conversation that you were having, but did anything that you learned in there has changed your perspective on Ukraine? No. You've been pretty out there. No, no, it did not. Listen. What I heard in there, let me just, you know, choose my words carefully given the, it was a request by briefing, but I'll just say this, I mean, if there's a path, if there's some path to victory in Ukraine, I didn't hear it today. And I also heard that there was going to be no end to the funding request. So I think this lays for quest for what is a 24 billion. That is not the end. They made that very clear. It's not close to the end. So I would just say what we're basically told is buckle up and get out your checkbook. Of course, it's not our checkbook. And can I just say, by the way, I'm sick and tired of hearing all of these people in that room for the administration applaud Congress for being so generous. This isn't our money. For heaven's sake, it's not our, we're not being generous. It's the American people's money. And they spent 115 billion of it. And so far they have basically nothing to show for it. And they're going to ask for a heck of a lot more. 24 billion is not the end. Not even close to the end. So what happens if Congress doesn't help pamphlet what they do? Well, hopefully number one, our European allies will actually do something. And they just confirm to us again that we have spent more than all of Europe combined. I mean, last I looked, Russia was in Europe. So we need our European allies to step up to the plate here in Germany in particular. We can start with them and do more. But that's not the message they're sending. The message they're sending is American and the American people are on the hook indefinitely. So let's have no more applause for Congress spending other people's money. They should go to the American people in this level of them and say we want 50, 100 billion more. Maybe more than that. So you could tell the Republicans they're saying that essentially we've drawn the assistance we're getting to Ukraine. Would amount to worse than what happened when the Biden administration withdrew to Afghanistan. What's your response in Paris? You know, here's what I think you could do. And let's listen to all, take all these comments about what would happen if we didn't keep spending the American people's money. Take out Ukraine, insert Iraq or insert Afghanistan. And you would get exactly what George W. Bush said for years. And other people after him about why we have to stay indefinitely in those countries and keep spending money indefinitely with no oversight, by the way. And at the end of the day, very little to show for it. It's the same recycled arguments. I don't know why we have to go through this again. I'm actually a little bit of a rough guy. Wow, the arguments aren't any different. It's the same argument over and over. Listen, I just listen to them say, for our standing in the world, we must keep spending this money. Literally, for our standing in the world. I mean, that's now what we're spending money on for our standing in the world. Do you play to a Mark Kelly mentioned that a pen impact today that after the war is over, there may be a need for a Marshall plan ask. You know, spending to rebuild the country. What do you make of that? Oh, yeah, that'll be next. We're talking about this, what I mean. They want 24 billion now. Many, many, many, many more billions over the next year. They just said that. And then they'll want on top of that. Who knows how much? Now listen, here's what I did today. I just stood out on the steps of the Capitol today with people from my state and around the country who are exposed to nuclear radiation by the federal government. And they haven't gotten a penny from their government. Not a penny for 70 years. And you want me to go spend their money, hugger billion more dollars on Ukraine. And they can't even get basic health care because they've been poisoned by their government with military operations. That furies me. Are you sensitive to all that pulling out of Ukraine? Bling a to away from Ukraine? Send a bad message to China? To President Xi? No, I think the message that we need to send, listen. The way to deter China is to deter China. And you have to do that in the Pacific. Ukraine is not in the Pacific. So our number one national security threat is China. Right now we are out of position. If China invades Taiwan tomorrow, we are not in a position to stop it. And I think we've got to tell the truth, America people. If they invade Taiwan, Taiwan falls. I mean, that's just, so if you're not concerned about that, then that's fine. But I am. Do you plan to attend Zelensky's meeting with Senators? I doubt it. Although after what I heard today, I'm thinking maybe I should, just because I was so surprised by what I just heard in there about the state of the effort that I thought, you know, maybe I should hear this directly from Zelensky. Because what I heard I was alarming. So you want to hear from him the staff? Staying in the war effort. I was surprised by what I heard in there about where it is. Do you have any questions for him? Well, I mean, on this side, I'd, I'll bet the progress. I mean, it was, that was a little different tune that was something to us there than I heard some in public. And it was an alarming one for I was to say without saying any more. Senator Oli, you know, Mitch McConnell is our unit that we've got a lot for money. That most of this money has gone to weapons manufacturing in the United States. No, it's trading contractors. Upgrading our own factories, modernizing them, restocking our own arms. That we gave them some of our older weapons. And that's actually going to help us and help our own military and provide jobs for Americans. At the same time, he points to Russia's military being degraded on the cheek. Because we've spent billions of dollars to counter the Russian military. For like a hundred billions, we've really helped Ukraine destroy a lot of Russian military equipment and capacity. And he also says, you know, Ukraine is free. That's a big deal. Well, you've, the last I looked, you've Korean had a whole bunch of Russian troops in their territory. So we've spent $113 billion that is not cheap of the American people's money. And frankly, the idea that the, I'm sure the military contractors are loving this. Oh, no doubt they are. They're making gobs of money. Is that equaling new American jobs? I'd love to see that analysis. I haven't heard any actual numbers. I've heard a lot of happy talk about it. I've also heard from the same people that spending a money in Ukraine is deterring China. I mean, these folks, if they want, they need to make the case for Ukraine. If they have a strategy to win, let's hear it. If they have a strategy actually in this conflict, let's hear it. But let's not have any more, frankly, misleading comments. Let's not lie to the American people about what we're doing and where we are. Let's not tell them we're winning when we are not. Let's not tell them that Ukraine is winning when it's not. Let's not tell them we're ready to stop China when we are not. They lied to us about Iraq. They lied to us about Afghanistan. I'm frankly tired of having them actively mislead us about Ukraine. I mean, this should stop. These people should stop. Do you think that the nation tried to provide the equipment to drive Russia, or forces entirely out of the grain? No, should we? No. Absolutely not. No. No, we should not. I'm totally opposed to putting American troops on the ground. They say they are. No. No. No, I think we should. No, we spent 115 billion, what we ought to be doing is getting our force posture where it needs to be in the Pacific, vis-a-vis China, where we are badly out of position. The other argument that's made, including by Mark Kelly, that came back to Ukraine is sort of a domino effect argument. That is right. That if you, if we pull out of Ukraine, like Vietnam, that they would then be on the doorstep of Poland, to go up and let the wania and all these other satellite states that you should be part of the Soviet Union. Well, wait, you just said a second ago that their military is significantly degraded. So how are they going to, it's one of the other, right? Other than the military is degraded, and they're not in position to do that, or they're about to overrun all of Europe. It's not both. So, I mean, I think you should put that question to the folks who say that. I mean, is their military, is it a roaring tiger? Is it degraded? I mean, it's one of the other. So, the truth is that the argument always shifts to whatever is at hand to get us to spend more of the American people's money without any strategy for victory, and that's what I just heard down there today. So, listen, I hope I'm wrong, but I better let you guys go. Are you saying based on what you heard today that the American public is being lied to on Ukraine? I think when you tell the American public that things are going well in Ukraine, that is not the truth. I think when you tell them we're in position in China where we need to be, that is not the truth. When you tell them that doing what we're doing in Ukraine is helping with the China fight, that is not the truth. So, I just think you should wish the truth, and that is not the truth. All right, thanks guys. Thank you. Thanks for the update.",subjective,foreign policy

Fair enough, this person works for you. This is Nuzha Ali, an employee of the Department of Homeland Security, who posted these comments on October the 7th. That's not all she posted. She also posted this graphic. Now this is a fake graphic I want to be clear, but I think we understand it. This is a paraglider, a Hamas paraglider, depicted here with a machine gun flying into Israel. She posted it under her online alias with the celebratory free Palestine. Mr. Secretary, what's going on here? Is this typical of people who work at DHS? This is an asylum and immigration officer who is posting these frankly progenous sidal slogans and images on the day that Israelis are being slaughtered in their beds. What have you done about this? Four things I'd like to say to you. Number one, your question to suggest that that is emblematic of the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security is despicable. I'm sorry. What have you, this person works for the Department of Homeland Security. Have you fired her? That was one of four answers. Have you fired her? So that individual has been placed on administrative leave. So she's not been fired? Number two, why has she not been fired? Number two, the individual was hired in 2019. Why has she not been fired? Number three, I cannot speak to an ongoing personnel matter. Why has this person not been fired? Your answer is you can't speak to it? This isn't sufficient to fire her? I am not in a position to speak to an ongoing personnel matter. That isn't sufficient to fire her? That's what you're telling me? That is not what I'm saying. That she's still on your payroll as we sit here today. That is not what I'm saying. She's still on your payroll as we sit here today. Senator? How many cases, she was an asylum and immigration officer. How many cases did she adjudicate? Senator, I'm not in a position to speak about an ongoing person. I'm not asking about that. I'm asking you how many cases she adjudicated? My answer remains. Did she adjudicate any cases involving Israelis seeking asylum in this country? Same answer. Well, let me disappoint you to what else she posted on social media. Where she drew attention to the fact that she is an immigration and asylum officer. Hashtag immigrants, hashtag asylum seekers, hashtag palestine, hashtag refugees. Welcome. This is on her linked end post, where she has her professional affiliation posted. So I think the American people deserve to know. Has she admitted contrary to law individuals who should not be in this country or denied Jewish refugees whose genocide she's advocating, asylum that they deserve? Same answer. You're not going to tell us what this person's done. Are you conducting review of her cases at least? Senator, as I have said, over and over again, I cannot speak to an ongoing person. You said that you will not. I can't believe that you would come to this committee knowing this. You know about this. I've written to you about it. You know all about it. And you come here unwilling to answer and suggest that it is wrong of me to ask you the question. Quite frankly, Mr. Secretary, I think that your performance is despicable. And I think the fact that you are not willing to provide answers to this committee is absolutely atrocious. Mr. Chairman, may I? If you'd like to have a minute to respond, you are obliged. I would. I'm not sure I'll limit it to 60 seconds. That's fine. Number one, what I found despicable is the implication that this language, tremendously odious, actually could be emblematic of the sentiments of the 260,000 men and women of the Department of Homeland Security. Number one. Number two, Senator Hawley takes an adversarial approach to me in this question. And perhaps he doesn't know my own background. Perhaps he does not know that I am the child of a Holocaust survivor. Perhaps he does not know that my mother lost almost all her family at the hands of the Nazis. And so I find his adversarial tone to be entirely misplaced. I find it to be disrespectful of me and my heritage. And I do not expect an apology, but I did want to say what I just articulated. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, can I just respond to see his reference to me personally? Senator Hawley, we need to move on. Senator Romney, you're recognized for your questions.",subjective,employee conduct

I'm talking about Senator Josh Holley for Missouri and his wife, Aaron. Josh Holley used to be the clerk for our current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts. His wife, Aaron, who's a lawyer, who's part of the Federalist Society, she used to clerk for John Roberts as well. This is how they met. And when it comes to anti-abortion, these two, they're the power couple. You gotta give it to Josh Holley's wife who's a lawyer by the way. Her name should be well known because she's the lawyer who helps shape the arguments for the Mississippi case. Dobbs, V. Jackson's, Women's Health Organization. Let me break it down for you. She helped overturn Roe v. Wade. Today, she was at it again. This time, arguing against the abortion appeal. Mifra Priston. Because of corruption and money, this is how this case in Texas made its way to the Supreme Court. A federal judge who first oversaw this case and whose name is Matthew Tasmeric. He's an extremely far-right judge who was nominated by Trump. He's all about role and bad reproductive rights and LGBTQ plus rights. This is the biggest abortion case since Roe v. Wade, a group who brought this case to the judge. One of the lawyers, their name was Aaron Holley. Josh Holley's wife. Why was Ms. Holley so confident that this case will go all the way up to the Supreme Court? And it has something to do with donations? Let's do the math. Trump first nominated the judge Matthew in 2017, but it went nowhere. In 2018, at Judge, he donated to Josh Holley's Senate campaign. Early 2019, Josh Holley was sworn in. And Joan of 2019, that judge Matthew, who was confirmed by the Senate. Months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, hurting her team, they filed the abortion appeal lawsuit in a small town in Texas. And who was the single judge presiding over that case? Mr. Matthew. Facts and receipts don't lie. Starting from a local level. Do you now see why voting matters? Stay focused.",subjective,abortion

Mr. Josh Hawley, born December 31st, 1979, his family would soon after move to Lexington, Missouri, because of all the Lexingtons in the world to choose from with why not Missouri. Despite living his entire life in those square states in the middle that nobody can pick out on a map, he was fortunate enough to be born into money. Daddy was a well-to-do banker and sent him to prep school in Kansas City, where he really honed in on that douchey rich kid personality. The kind that makes that little voice in your head ask if you know punching a child is really that bad. During his prep school years, he wrote columns for the local newspaper, where he denounced affirmative action. Wrote a whole column defending right-wing extremist groups right after Timothy McVeigh did the thing he did. Then he'd go on to get his BA in history from Stanford. One can only assume because he wanted to deep-dive into what would have made 1930s Germany just a little bit more successful. Then he'd go on to get his juris doctor from Yale, and spend some time working for the Beckett Fund for Religious Liberty. There's basically a bunch of religious nuts who also happen to be lawyers and spend their time lobbying the Supreme Court to make us a theocracy. Then sometimes a faculty member for Blackstone Legal Fellowship, just like a training summer camp that teaches lawyers how to force their religious beliefs on gay people and women. In 2016, he would go on to run for a Attorney General of Missouri, or David Humphries, or Rich CEO, would spend $4.4 million of his own money to buy the election for Holly. The first things he did as a Attorney General was choose to not prosecute Sheriff Cory Hutchinson, and the officers involved in tasing and beating a mentally ill-maned death in jail, which they did because they didn't have any reason to hold Tory Sanders, this mentally ill man, and he didn't want to leave because he was scared. You got annoyed that he wouldn't leave, they just pepper sprayed him and beat him until he died of excited delirium, which is a completely made-up thing not recognized by anybody in the psychiatric field, but often used by cops who don't want to admit that they beat tays and pepper sprayed people to death while they were in custody. How were we supposed to know that beating somebody nearly to death would make them so excited they might actually die? So not off to a great start, but his next big move as AG would be going after Big Pharma, like Pfizer, for their roles in the opioid epidemic. So that wasn't such a bad thing, you know? And then when the Columbia, Missouri, and in a huge expose on Missouri, ignoring the problem of rape and having a huge backlog of untested rape kits, all the order to not it of those rape kits and found that there was 5,000 untested, many investigated Google for violating any trust and consumer protection laws. Oh, maybe he's starting to come around or redemption might be possible. But then there was that whole scandal with Eric Gritons, the Missouri governor, like misusing public funds and then having it affair and blackmailing the woman to keep it quiet. And at first, Holly absolutely refused to investigate it, and then he got a whole bunch of heat for that. So he's like, okay, I'll investigate it. And he's like, eh, I looked into it. There's nothing there, you know? And then once the evidence became so overwhelming, it couldn't be ignored. And he stepped down. Holly was like, yeah, that's good enough. We don't need to charge him with a felony, you know? And then in 2018, a bunch of Republican states got together again to have another lawsuit again about the Affordable Care Act being unconstitutional again. And of course, it would fail again. Holly was all too excited to jump on board with that. And then later that year, Bobby Bostick would come in the news for appealing his sentencing of 241 years for robbery at the age of 16. A sentence that violated a Supreme Court ruling that stated that miners could not be sent into life for charges less than homicide. And Josh came out to publicly defend the sentence. As a result, Bobby is still in prison today and will be for the rest of his life, for committing robbery at 16 years old. Something Josh Holly feels is an absolutely appropriate punishment. So don't worry, guys, your gut wasn't wrong. He's still a piece of shit. At this time, Holly was also running for Senate. And he decided that he would use a state staff as his personal campaign staff, which is illegal. And because he was attorney general, he knew that that was illegal. So he covered it up, which is, you know, also illegal. For this, the attorney general's office was fine $12,000. Where's that wrist? I'm feeling a little sloppy. Anyway, after being endorsed by the Bronze or Cat, he went on to win his senatorial race almost a year after he was sworn in as attorney general, and after criticizing other politicians for for ladder climbing and not spending enough time in their in their first elected position. He said, but no, guys, it's different for me because I didn't plan on running for Senate when I was running for attorney general. Just just kind of happened. I just sort of fell into being a senator, you know, by accident, up to sea. And then immediately after getting elected, an inquiry was opened into him, misappropriating public funds during his campaign. And since then, he's taken all the worst parts about Mitch McConnell and all the worst parts about Ted Cruz and just mashed them together and is like, that's the senator I want to be. Doing things like being the only senator to vote against a bill amendment to investigate anti-Asian hate crime. And openly admitting shit like he thinks government should be guided by scripture. And being the only senator to vote against Sweden and Finland joining NATO because China. That's literally his only reason is they shouldn't join because China is a threat. In that same vein, we shouldn't support Ukraine and they also shouldn't be allowed to join NATO because China also went on a really big anti-Semitic rant about the cosmopolitan agenda. Then when it was pointed out that Joseph Stalin used the same cosmopolitan terminology as anti-Semitic rhetoric. He's like, oh no, you guys just don't read an internet. What? Willie, because like anybody else talks about the cosmopolitan elites. This is a good one on human trafficking. Joshy Washchuk's Holly says that it's only a problem because of the sexual revolution of the 1960s and premarital sex and contraception. Oh, and Hollywood. If everybody else was just like him where they got married and only banged their wife, those three times she got drunk enough to tolerate being touched by him, human trafficking wouldn't be a thing. And I mean, obviously that makes total sense. Sexually repressed married men never get caught paying for sex or sleeping with minors. I'm sure everybody on Epstein's client list was single. He still looks like he's 13 and I still want to punch him in the throw and that is just just fucking with my head a little bit. In a weird moment of him not being a horrible human being, he teamed up with Bernie Sanders to fight for those $1200 COVID checks we got. So I guess not not all bad credit where it's due. Then 2020 happened and he went off the rails like Norfolk's other. He's the first senator to object to certifying the election result. Blabbered on and on about baseless election fraud claims like he was a pillow salesman on a coke vendor. He got so annoying with the election fraud bullshit that even Walmart tweeted telling him to shut the fuck up hashtags or loser. Some protesters getting fed up with him trying to subvert democracy went to his house and held a protest in the form of a candlelight vigil. Now when they left they left him a copy of the constitution in case you know he ever felt like maybe reading it and he had a full blown meltdown. A temper tantrum fit for that toddler face he's got. Saying oh that scumbag antifa came to my house and vandalized it and threatened my family. And then when the vana virginia police were asked about this horrific vandalism of a senator's house they're like uh sure what what he's talking about. I mean they they wrote in chalk on the sidewalk out front but that that's not technically vandalism. I don't know they seemed pretty peaceful to us. We didn't we didn't think it was that big of a deal. And then January 6th happens. Holly runs out to salute the trees and tribe and hold up his white power fist. And at some point during his cheering on sedition it dawned on him that these are just a bunch of mouth-breathing troglodytes who probably don't have any fucking clue who he actually is. And these people do only have the hard drive space to remember like three people in Washington and they reserve that space for Donald Trump Hillary Clinton and Hunter Biden's laptop. So at a certain point like Ralph from the Simpsons he thought to himself I'm in danger. And then there's security footage of him running away like a little bitch. The kind of little bitch who would think that sidewalk chalk is vandalism. After this he started to get hated by pretty much everybody. John Danforth went on to say that mentoring Holly was the worst mistake of his entire life. Yale said that he should be disbarred. Airbnb AT&T Mastercard Best Buy American Express and a few others all pulled their funding from him. Hallmark literally asked him to give their contributions to his campaign back. Most people would be like you know maybe maybe have crossed a line. But by Golly Holly was not going to be dissuaded by you know Democrats or Republicans or the voters the media or his colleagues or his mentors or his teachers or a sense of decency or morals or pride or values. He used the opportunity of being persecuted by the cancel culture to fundraise, to fight back against cancel culture. Can you get any more cancel culture than trying to cancel democracy because it hurts your feelings? Anyway since then he's written a TikTok band that sucks so much it got blocked by the senate. Otherwise has just been obstructionist for the sake of being obstructionist which means he doesn't really accomplish anything. So he continues to just whine about election fraud, vote against everybody who hurts his feats and masturbate every night to pictures of Donald Trump because his wife probably sleeps in a completely different house. Yeah he is just one of many many glaring examples of why Missouri should not be allowed to make decisions on anything. Seriously Missouri you are just very clearly not okay lately. I think we need you to to turn in your senators and your representatives and just work on you guys for a while. Take some personal days. Maybe a vacation, take some time, read a book if you haven't burned them all already. Maybe take your child bride to Chuck E. Cheese for date night. I don't know just go take some time, get your head right and don't worry. We've got everything over here handled just go away.",subjective,political corruption

Clearly, the ACLU is the 800-pound gorilla on the First Amendment. The ACLU made this statement, we don't support the NRA's mission or its viewpoints on Pew-Pew, right? And we don't agree with their goals, strategies, or tactic. But we know that government officials can't punish organizations because they just approve of their views.

He was born in San Diego and graduated from the Stevens Institute of Technology. He started his career as a businessman in the software industry, having co-founded BrightWork development, which specialized in banking software. Him and his wife later co-founded another company called BrightNow Technologies. He amassed a fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars and was once called the Godfather of Montana Tech. Because of his wealth, his financial ties have come under great scrutiny. He got into politics when he ran for governor in 2016 against incumbent Steve Bullock. Despite sharing a ballot with Donald Trump, he narrowly lost the election. But Trump appointed Montana's lone congressman as secretary of the interior. So, G. and Forte ran in the special election just six months later. The night before the election, as I mentioned, he body slammed a reporter. But he still won that election and re-election to a full term in 2018. When Governor Bullock was term-limited, G. and Forte ran again in 2021. And unlike his last three races, he easily won. G. and Forte is a reliably conservative governor and promoted his ties with Donald Trump and his past campaign. He took office in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and focused on helping small businesses. He scrapped restrictions on businesses and social gatherings and later banned vaccine mandates. He's enacted several gun policies, notably banning law enforcement from enacting any gun restriction set by the Biden administration and signing a constitutional carry bill into law. He signed a bill banning transgender health care for minors, even though his non-binary son urged him not to. Interestingly, he signed a bill banning sanctuary cities, even though none existed in the state. He led Montana through historic flooding in the summer of 2022 and declared a state of emergency. He has put in big decisions on the budget for 2024, including millions of dollars to combat state hospital wait lists, and also cutting $23 million in state infrastructure fund. In addition, he's focused a lot on housing reform, which is something that's a particularly big issue in the state.

Governor Greg Giaforte, a man who is physically violent, my dad, on Wednesday afternoon signed into law Senate Bill 419, legislation introduced by Senator Shelley Vance, Republican Belgrade that banned social media app TikTok in the state of Montana beginning January 1, 2024. The bill, which garnered significant controversy during the legislative session, prohibits the operation of the app within the territorial jurisdiction of Montana and imposes fines on any entity that operates TikTok or allows users to download it through mobile application stores within Montana. Senate Bill 419 does not, however, include provisions that would allow the state to prosecute individual Montana's for using the app. So if you live in Montana and you already have the app downloaded, you should be fine. What I'm hearing, it sounds like they're just going to try to find TikTok and bite dance for distributing it to Montana's. Which how are they going to enforce that? So Giaforte on Wednesday characterized the bill as a critical step in protecting Montana's against spying for an adversaries. Okay, namely China, the country in which TikTok's parent company Bite Dance is based. Our dumbass governor said he's basically doing it to protect us from the Chinese Communist Party saying that they're using it to spy on us. And this is to protect Montana's private data and sensitive personal information from being harvested by the Chinese Communist Party. Idiot, dude. So back in December, he actually banned the use of TikTok on state-owned networks and devices, and the Montana University system in January blocked access to the app on campus networks. So opponents of the bill have argued that the ban would unfairly target the singular platform and would hurt Montana's who use TikTok to promote their businesses. The director of policy and advocacy for the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana said we also believe that this is a blatant exercise of censorship and is an egregious violation of Montana's free speech. The bill also states that if TikTok is sold to a company that is not incorporated into any other country designated as foreign adversary, then the law will be void. So that's all we really know for right now. We'll see what happens come January, but I find this embarrassing. I find this a self-report of their incompetency. Yeah, this is an embarrassment. I don't know how they're going to enforce it. They are what they hate, basically. And if you haven't looked into our governor, Geoforte, I highly recommend it. He physically assaulted a reporter.

Governor Greg Giaforte, a man who is physically violent, my dad, on Wednesday afternoon signed into law Senate Bill 419, legislation introduced by Senator Shelley Vance, Republican Belgrade that banned social media app TikTok in the state of Montana beginning January 1, 2024. The bill, which garnered significant controversy during the legislative session, prohibits the operation of the app within the territorial jurisdiction of Montana and imposes fines on any entity that operates TikTok or allows users to download it through mobile application stores within Montana. Senate Bill 419 does not, however, include provisions that would allow the state to prosecute individual Montana's for using the app. So if you live in Montana and you already have the app downloaded, you should be fine.

So Giaforte on Wednesday characterized the bill as a critical step in protecting Montana's against spying for an adversaries. Okay, namely China, the country in which TikTok's parent company Bite Dance is based. Our dumbass governor said he's basically doing it to protect us from the Chinese Communist Party saying that they're using it to spy on us. And this is to protect Montana's private data and sensitive personal information from being harvested by the Chinese Communist Party. Idiot, dude. So back in December, he actually banned the use of TikTok on state-owned networks and devices, and the Montana University system in January blocked access to the app on campus networks. So opponents of the bill have argued that the ban would unfairly target the singular platform and would hurt Montana's who use TikTok to promote their businesses. The director of policy and advocacy for the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana said we also believe that this is a blatant exercise of censorship and is an egregious violation of Montana's free speech. The bill also states that if TikTok is sold to a company that is not incorporated into any other country designated as foreign adversary, then the law will be void. So that's all we really know for right now. We'll see what happens come January, but I find this embarrassing. I find this a self-report of their incompetency. Yeah, this is an embarrassment.

So back in December, he actually banned the use of TikTok on state-owned networks and devices, and the Montana University system in January blocked access to the app on campus networks. So opponents of the bill have argued that the ban would unfairly target the singular platform and would hurt Montana's who use TikTok to promote their businesses. The director of policy and advocacy for the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana said we also believe that this is a blatant exercise of censorship and is an egregious violation of Montana's free speech. The bill also states that if TikTok is sold to a company that is not incorporated into any other country designated as foreign adversary, then the law will be void. So that's all we really know for right now. We'll see what happens come January, but I find this embarrassing. I find this a self-report of their incompetency. Yeah, this is an embarrassment. I don't know how they're going to enforce it. They are what they hate, basically. And if you haven't looked into our governor, Geoforte, I highly recommend it. He physically assaulted a reporter.

He was born in San Diego and graduated from the Stevens Institute of Technology. He started his career as a businessman in the software industry, having co-founded BrightWork development, which specialized in banking software. Him and his wife later co-founded another company called BrightNow Technologies. He amassed a fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars and was once called the Godfather of Montana Tech. Because of his wealth, his financial ties have come under great scrutiny. He got into politics when he ran for governor in 2016 against incumbent Steve Bullock. Despite sharing a ballot with Donald Trump, he narrowly lost the election. But Trump appointed Montana's lone congressman as secretary of the interior. So, G. and Forte ran in the special election just six months later. The night before the election, as I mentioned, he body slammed a reporter. But he still won that election and re-election to a full term in 2018. When Governor Bullock was term-limited, G. and Forte ran again in 2021. And unlike his last three races, he easily won. G. and Forte is a reliably conservative governor and promoted his ties with Donald Trump and his past campaign. He took office in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and focused on helping small businesses. He scrapped restrictions on businesses and social gatherings and later banned vaccine mandates. He's enacted several gun policies, notably banning law enforcement from enacting any gun restriction set by the Biden administration and signing a constitutional carry bill into law. He signed a bill banning transgender health care for minors, even though his non-binary son urged him not to. Interestingly, he signed a bill banning sanctuary cities, even though none existed in the state. He led Montana through historic flooding in the summer of 2022 and declared a state of emergency. He has put in big decisions on the budget for 2024, including millions of dollars to combat state hospital wait lists, and also cutting $23 million in state infrastructure fund. In addition, he's focused a lot on housing reform, which is something that's a particularly big issue in the state. Some saw him as a potential challenger to Democratic Senator John Tester in the 2024 election. But it appears more likely than not the new run for re-election to a second term.",subjective,montana

Governor Greg Giaforte, a man who is physically violent, my dad, on Wednesday afternoon signed into law Senate Bill 419, legislation introduced by Senator Shelley Vance, Republican Belgrade that banned social media app TikTok in the state of Montana beginning January 1, 2024. The bill, which garnered significant controversy during the legislative session, prohibits the operation of the app within the territorial jurisdiction of Montana and imposes fines on any entity that operates TikTok or allows users to download it through mobile application stores within Montana. Senate Bill 419 does not, however, include provisions that would allow the state to prosecute individual Montana's for using the app. So if you live in Montana and you already have the app downloaded, you should be fine. What I'm hearing, it sounds like they're just going to try to find TikTok and bite dance for distributing it to Montana's. Which how are they going to enforce that? So Giaforte on Wednesday characterized the bill as a critical step in protecting Montana's against spying for an adversaries. Okay, namely China, the country in which TikTok's parent company Bite Dance is based. Our dumbass governor said he's basically doing it to protect us from the Chinese Communist Party saying that they're using it to spy on us.

Things are, the fit is hitting the share. It really is. We just had a great article break about Mike Johnson, the speaker of the house. A guy by the name of Constantine Nicolayev, donated to his campaign. That's the Russian that was funding Maria Boutina, the Russian spy that infiltrated the Republican party, via the NRA. The Russian spy that when she was caught, arrested, and eventually deported, was met in Russia with bouquets of flowers because of what a great job she had done damaging our country. Yeah, that guy's donated to Mike Johnson. But that's not even close to scratching the surface of it. We've got Alexander Smirnoff that's been arrested. He's a Russian spy that James Comer and Jimmy Jordan and all of them were using to try to take down an American president. He is admitted to investigators that his information came from the Russian government. Directly from Russian intelligence and Republicans were more than happy to work with them. Knowing what this guy is, they work babes in the woods. James Comer, Jimmy Jordan, they're committed, with their committee assignments, they have clearances and are briefed. When they picked up Alexander Smirnoff as a witness, they were briefed as to what he was. The government told them. But they were willing to work with him anyways to try to take down an American president for their own power. And it doesn't stop there. It's not just federal. Wired. Just did an amazing job. They hired two firms that specialize in disinformation to take a look at what's going on down here at my border, down here in Texas. The border with Mexico. And they were able to find coordination between the Russian government. You remember Medvedev, the former president of Russia, who's now the head of their Security Council. He came out and made a bunch of statements about civil war here in Texas and that we're being invaded and all those talking points. And when Putin was sitting down with Tuckio Rose, I mean, just out of the blue for some reason, he brings up our border with Mexico. Well, it turns out that their intelligence has been working through telegram and X-chan, you know, Twitter, the site formerly known as Twitter, I call it X-chan, to just pump information out, misinformation out about our southern border. And so many, the idea of civil war, you remember that all the talk that just suddenly blew up. Civil war, civil war, is Texas going to secede and I had people sending me emails all over the place. Is Texas going to secede? No, they were not going to secede. That was all a Russian hot. And look how the Republicans were more than one of the Republicans.

It was that way across the South. Republican parties were started in the South by African Americans. In the state of Texas, two of our first three statewide Republican Chairman were African American. The first 42 black legislators elected in Texas were all Republican. The first 112 black legislators elected in Mississippi were all Republican. The first 190 black legislators elected in South Carolina were all Republican. The first 41 in Georgia, the first 127 in Louisiana. So now you've got all these African Americans really stepping up and starting to gain political standing, political power. Now you have Democrats on the other side who have been very racist. It's in their platforms. They support the Grudge Scott decision. They think the future of slave law is great. They started a nation to keep slavery alive, very racist. And so now they're facing a situation where that these blacks are now their rulers, are now in office, are now U.S. senators, are now U.S. How do you stop that? 1866 Democrats themselves started the Ku Klux Klan. Its purpose was not to kill blacks. Its purpose was to take control and return Democrats to power. Their stated purpose in the KKK was to stop Republicans and restore Democratic control. Now if you're looking for a Republican that you want to take care of, you can wipe out any black you want because there are 100% Republicans at that point in time. You can't wipe out any white. I mean some whites might be Democrats. You've got to be a little more judicious when you're wiping out whites. So what happens is the Ku Klux Klan starts attacking not blacks, Republican conventions, for example, in New Orleans, in the Republican convention in Louisiana. The Klan joined with the New Orleans police, joined with the New Orleans mayor, Democrats. They attacked physically at the convention in New Orleans, Republican convention. They killed 40 blacks, killed 20 whites, they wounded 150 others. 1868 they put out a push card in South Carolina and it listed what they call the radical members of the South Carolina legislature. Now push cards about the size of baseball card is put up by the Klan. Then put it out, it had the pictures of 63 legislators that needed to be wiped out in South Carolina. 50 of those legislators were black, 13 were white. Now they were all 63 Republican. On the back of the card, it gave you the name of each legislator so you know you're trying to kill. Congress starts these hearings on this group called the Klan and they have hearings and so they bring in Democrat leaders that under oath from these Democrat states that yes, the Klan belongs to our party. This actually in Congress, 1872 the hearings is a 13 volume set of hearings in Congress. Unequivocally Democrats say the Klan is ours and belongs to us. It's there to restore Democrat control in the Southern states. Those guys who lived through it made it very clear. For example one of the early black congressmen was John Roy Lynch. Another early black congressman was Richard Cain and they're having to fight the Klan physically for their own safety. They go armed to Congress because of the Klan attacks. These guys said if we as black would simply stop voting the Republican ticket. If we would agree to vote the straight Democrat ticket, all the violence against the Klan",subjective,political power

It was that way across the South. Republican parties were started in the South by African Americans. In the state of Texas, two of our first three statewide Republican Chairman were African American. The first 42 black legislators elected in Texas were all Republican. The first 112 black legislators elected in Mississippi were all Republican. The first 190 black legislators elected in South Carolina were all Republican. The first 41 in Georgia, the first 127 in Louisiana. So now you've got all these African Americans really stepping up and starting to gain political standing, political power. Now you have Democrats on the other side who have been very racist. It's in their platforms. They support the Grudge Scott decision. They think the future of slave law is great. They started a nation to keep slavery alive, very racist. And so now they're facing a situation where that these blacks are now their rulers, are now in office, are now U.S. senators, are now U.S. How do you stop that? 1866 Democrats themselves started the Ku Klux Klan. Its purpose was not to kill blacks. Its purpose was to take control and return Democrats to power. Their stated purpose in the KKK was to stop Republicans and restore Democratic control. Now if you're looking for a Republican that you want to take care of, you can wipe out any black you want because there are 100% Republicans at that point in time. You can't wipe out any white. I mean some whites might be Democrats. You've got to be a little more judicious when you're wiping out whites. So what happens is the Ku Klux Klan starts attacking not blacks, Republican conventions, for example, in New Orleans, in the Republican convention in Louisiana. The Klan joined with the New Orleans police, joined with the New Orleans mayor, Democrats. They attacked physically at the convention in New Orleans, Republican convention. They killed 40 blacks, killed 20 whites, they wounded 150 others. 1868 they put out a push card in South Carolina and it listed what they call the radical members of the South Carolina legislature. Now push cards about the size of baseball card is put up by the Klan. Then put it out, it had the pictures of 63 legislators that needed to be wiped out in South Carolina. 50 of those legislators were black, 13 were white. Now they were all 63 Republican. On the back of the card, it gave you the name of each legislator so you know you're trying to kill. Congress starts these hearings on this group called the Klan and they have hearings and so they bring in Democrat leaders that under oath from these Democrat states that yes, the Klan belongs to our party. This actually in Congress, 1872 the hearings is a 13 volume set of hearings in Congress. Unequivocally Democrats say the Klan is ours and belongs to us. It's there to restore Democrat control in the Southern states. Those guys who lived through it made it very clear. For example one of the early black congressmen was John Roy Lynch. Another early black congressman was Richard Cain and they're having to fight the Klan physically for their own safety. They go armed to Congress because of the Klan attacks. These guys said if we as black would simply stop voting the Republican ticket. If we would agree to vote the straight Democrat ticket, all the violence against the Klan",subjective,political power

Polygamy emerged a one-man to multiple women, devalued women, and made them a kind of property. Slavery, of course, did the same to blacks, literally. The Democrats were so opposed to the Republicans in their anti-slavery stands that in 1860, just six weeks after the election of the first Republican President Abraham Lincoln, South Carolina, a state dominated by Democrats voted to succeed from the Union. The Civil War that followed was the bloodiest war in US history. It led to the passage by Republicans of the 13th Amendment, which freed the slaves, the 14th Amendment, which gave them citizenship, and the 15th Amendment, which gave them the vote.

The first 190 black legislators elected in South Carolina were all Republican. The first 41 in Georgia, the first 127 in Louisiana. So now you've got all these African Americans really stepping up and starting to gain political standing, political power. Now you have Democrats on the other side who have been very racist. It's in their platforms. They support the Grudge Scott decision. They think the future of slave law is great. They started a nation to keep slavery alive, very racist. And so now they're facing a situation where that these blacks are now their rulers, are now in office, are now U.S. senators, are now U.S. How do you stop that? 1866 Democrats themselves started the Ku Klux Klan. Its purpose was not to kill blacks. Its purpose was to take control and return Democrats to power. Their stated purpose in the KKK was to stop Republicans and restore Democratic control. Now if you're looking for a Republican that you want to take care of, you can wipe out any black you want because there are 100% Republicans at that point in time. You can't wipe out any white. I mean some whites might be Democrats. You've got to be a little more judicious when you're wiping out whites. So what happens is the Ku Klux Klan starts attacking not blacks, Republican conventions, for example, in New Orleans, in the Republican convention in Louisiana. The Klan joined with the New Orleans police, joined with the New Orleans mayor, Democrats. They attacked physically at the convention in New Orleans, Republican convention. They killed 40 blacks, killed 20 whites, they wounded 150 others. 1868 they put out a push card in South Carolina and it listed what they call the radical members of the South Carolina legislature. Now push cards about the size of baseball card is put up by the Klan. Then put it out, it had the pictures of 63 legislators that needed to be wiped out in South Carolina. 50 of those legislators were black, 13 were white. Now they were all 63 Republican. On the back of the card, it gave you the name of each legislator so you know you're trying to kill. Congress starts these hearings on this group called the Klan and they have hearings and so they bring in Democrat leaders that under oath from these Democrat states that yes, the Klan belongs to our party. This actually in Congress, 1872 the hearings is a 13 volume set of hearings in Congress. Unequivocally Democrats say the Klan is ours and belongs to us. It's there to restore Democrat control in the Southern states. Those guys who lived through it made it very clear. For example one of the early black congressmen was John Roy Lynch. Another early black congressman was Richard Cain and they're having to fight the Klan physically for their own safety. They go armed to Congress because of the Klan attacks.

Things are, the fit is hitting the share. It really is. We just had a great article break about Mike Johnson, the speaker of the house.

The Russian spy that when she was caught, arrested, and eventually deported, was met in Russia with bouquets of flowers because of what a great job she had done damaging our country. Yeah, that guy's donated to Mike Johnson. But that's not even close to scratching the surface of it. We've got Alexander Smirnoff that's been arrested. He's a Russian spy that James Comer and Jimmy Jordan and all of them were using to try to take down an American president. He is admitted to investigators that his information came from the Russian government. Directly from Russian intelligence and Republicans were more than happy to work with them. Knowing what this guy is, they work babes in the woods. James Comer, Jimmy Jordan, they're committed, with their committee assignments, they have clearances and are briefed. When they picked up Alexander Smirnoff as a witness, they were briefed as to what he was. The government told them. But they were willing to work with him anyways to try to take down an American president for their own power. And it doesn't stop there. It's not just federal. Wired. Just did an amazing job. They hired two firms that specialize in disinformation to take a look at what's going on down here at my border, down here in Texas. The border with Mexico. And they were able to find coordination between the Russian government. You remember Medvedev, the former president of Russia, who's now the head of their Security Council. He came out and made a bunch of statements about civil war here in Texas and that we're being invaded and all those talking points. And when Putin was sitting down with Tuckio Rose, I mean, just out of the blue for some reason, he brings up our border with Mexico. Well, it turns out that their intelligence has been working through telegram and X-chan, you know, Twitter, the site formerly known as Twitter, I call it X-chan, to just pump information out, misinformation out about our southern border. And so many, the idea of civil war, you remember that all the talk that just suddenly blew up. Civil war, civil war, is Texas going to secede and I had people sending me emails all over the place.

It's actually none of that. Marjorie Taylor Greene may not stay on the ballot in her very Republican District in Georgia, based on a tiny clause in the 14th Amendment. You know, the amendment that made all freed slaves citizens with equal rights. But I'm sorry, you knew that, you knew that. But as part of that amendment, anyone who's taken an oath, like Greene, could be barred from holding public office if they engaged in rebellion or insurrection against the United States. A group of voters from Greene's district have accused her of just that. And this week, a judge said Greene will have to testify under oath about her involvement in the events around January 6th. Marjorie Taylor Greene says this is all a scam and she too was a victim of the riot. Here's what she told ABC station WTVC. You know, it's really simple for me. The truth is there and it's easy to prove. I all I did was what I'm legally and allowed to do by the Constitution as a member of Congress.

Those twin relics were spreading into the Western territories. Republicans feared that as those territories became states, polygamy and slavery might become permanent parts of American life. Polygamy emerged a one-man to multiple women, devalued women, and made them a kind of property. Slavery, of course, did the same to blacks, literally. The Democrats were so opposed to the Republicans in their anti-slavery stands that in 1860, just six weeks after the election of the first Republican President Abraham Lincoln, South Carolina, a state dominated by Democrats voted to succeed from the Union. The Civil War that followed was the bloodiest war in US history. It led to the passage by Republicans of the 13th Amendment, which freed the slaves, the 14th Amendment, which gave them citizenship, and the 15th Amendment, which gave them the vote. In 1870, the first black senator and the first black congressman were sworn in, both Republicans.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand congresswoman known for her controversial statements, has just dropped a bombshell announcement that has left the internet buzzing. In a surprising turn of events, Marjorie Taylor Greene has revealed that she is pregnant. But here's the twist that nobody saw coming. She claims that the father of her unborn child is none other than the former president himself. Donald Trump. Yes, you heard that right. Marjorie Taylor Greene has publicly declared that she is expecting a baby with Donald Trump, sending social media into a frenzy of speculation and disbelief. The news has left many scratching their heads and others gasping in shock. While some may dismiss this revelation, as a mere publicity stunt, or a wild hoax, the implications are nothing short of extraordinary. Imagine the former leader of the free world allegedly fathering a child with a controversial congresswoman known for her unwavering support. Predictably, Trump has wasted no time in vehemently denying the claim, calling Marjorie Taylor Greene's announcement a diabolical lie and threatening legal action against her. He insists that their relationship is purely professional and accuses her of trying to tarnish his reputation. It emits the chaos and confusion, one question looms large. Is there any truth to Marjorie Taylor Greene's shocking revelation? Could this be a case of political intrigue, a scandalous affair, or perhaps just a cleverly orchestrated prank? As the nation waits with baited breath for further developments, one thing is for certain. Marjorie Taylor Greene's pregnancy bombshell has ignited a firestorm of controversy that shows no signs of a baiting.

Let me tell you something, not one Republican member of our conference that I have spoken to has any idea what is in this foreign aid package that's going to give $60 billion to Ukraine. And that is even the leadership offices. They haven't heard from Mike Johnson on the details. We're reading about it in the news the same way the American people are, and it's outrageous. When you saw Zelensky right there on that interview talking about, oh, we're going to lose territory. Oh, we really need this money. This $60 billion should have been approved yesterday. Let me tell you, we are losing our country to the illegal invasion that's happening every single day at our southern border. And I am so pissed off about it because the American people are pissed off about it. And while our so-called Republican speaker of the house is only working with Chuck Schumer and Hawkeye Jeffries and Ukraine first, Mitch McConnell and the White House and Jake Sullivan who he talks to on the phone all the time, we are angry. And people have had it. We don't want $60 billion to go to Ukraine because as we slept last night, Tucker, we just went $40 billion more into debt. And that's because the interest in our debt is so huge and our debt is so massive. This is happening while we sleep every single night. So no, we don't want to send $60 billion to Ukraine. We want to put our country first. It's time to care about America. So, I mean, is it true? Do you think that the Republican speaker would bring this up at when your recess ends and get it passed without the majority of Republicans? But with Democrats, could that actually happen? Yeah. Yeah, because that's what he's planning to do. Here's what I've been told. Well, first off, let's go back, Tucker. The last vote that we had on any Ukraine funding was on September 28th of 2023. That was only months ago. And that vote only 101 Republicans voted yes for $300 million. $300 million to go to Ukraine. And that was because I pitched an enormous fit and said, take this money out of our Department of Defense. We should not be funding a foreign war in order to fund our military. That's completely wrong. And our military, their mission is stated on their website is to put our national security first. It's all about our national security. Fighting a proxy war with Russia in Ukraine, which is a non-NATO member nation, is not protecting America's national security interest. It doesn't protect the United States of America. As a matter of fact, that pushes us closer and closer to World War III. So, we had that vote on September 28th, 2023. 117 Republicans voted no. That was the majority of the majority. Every single Democrat voted yes. Every single one. They had zero Democrats vote no. Our Republican speaker of the House is planning to suspend the rules next week. He is planning to not put this bill through the Rules Committee. He's not going to allow us to do any amendments. Amendments are our way of changing a bill. Amendments are our way of putting our district's interest, who we represent. That's our job title, representative. It's our way of changing a bill. My Johnson is going to tie our hands behind our backs and not allow us to do that. As he brings that bill to the floor, every Democrat will vote for it. And a small portion of Republicans, less than the majority, will vote for it as well. And this isn't a Republican speaker we have right now. This is a Democrat speaker of the House, because there is zero daylight between what Nancy Pelosi did last Congress. And what Mike Johnson is doing now is our so-called Republican speaker of the House. It's just an amazing thing to see. Will he take a call from you? I'm planning to speak with him on Friday, and I'm very much looking forward to that. It's just interesting that he's talking and a lot of people in the media are talking. We haven't been able to talk to, but to Zelensky, who's a foreigner with his own interests, of course, but not an American. And certainly not, we hope a voter in this country. But all these people take calls from Zelensky and are swayed by him. Is it a little weird to see an American speaker of the House pay closer attention to a foreign leader or a number of different foreign leaders than he would to his own voters and colleagues in the House and our legislative body? Yeah, absolutely, especially considering Mike Johnson has completely changed his character in a matter of about five months after he has become speaker of the House. Johnson is a Christian. He called himself a conservative always has been. He's a Republican member. But yet here we are after the many best was passed just almost two weeks ago in Washington. And now with the $60 billion going to a war in Ukraine that Americans 70% of Americans do not support it. That's the most recent polling. 70% of Americans and the majority of our majority of Republicans do not support funding Ukraine. People want to see a peace deal in Ukraine, not murdering more Ukrainians and more Russians. This needs to end. But no, Mike Johnson has has made a complete departure of who he is and what he stands for. And to the point where people are literally asking, is he blackmailed? What is wrong with him? Because he's completely disconnected with what we want. Do you think he is being blackmailed? I have no idea.",subjective,foreign aid

Mr. Mayor, we do not have a country without a secure border. And we cannot have a safe country. We cannot protect our own democracy without protecting our elections. That is a fact. The open border is the number one issue across America and pull after pull. And that is exactly why this committee impeached you. Mr. Secretary, the oversight project released a bombshell report last night on your connection to the dark money in geo-industrial complex of illegal immigration. I know you saw this from one of my colleagues just earlier. They found flyers throughout the Resource Center, Matamoris, Refugee Camp in Mexico telling illegal aliens, reminder to vote for President Biden when you are in the United States. We need another four years of his term to stay open. I witnessed this saw the flyers also being handed out to migrants who were using RCM for assistance in coming to the United States. In an audio recording, the founder of RCM Gabby Zavala, by the way, we maybe should subpoena her to the committee, agreed that they need to help as many people as possible before President Trump gets reelected. RCM is an operation that houses functions for the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, which helps migrants in or the United States, and you're familiar with their work. We know that you served as a former board member of this group that funds illegal immigration. And they're very proud of you, Mr. Secretary. They congratulate you on your nomination. You worked as a board member of an NGO that is working in conjunction with other NGOs, which are not only financing the invasion of the country, but also telling illegal aliens to vote in the United States elections. They are telling illegal aliens, non-citizens, to come vote for Joe Biden. That's your boss. This is corruption at the deepest level. As a matter of fact, I would call it treason. It's treason because these people have declared war on our citizens by raping our women, our children, and murdering people. Like Lake in Riley, you're familiar with her, right? Congressman, our part breaking. Are you familiar with Lake in Riley? I am familiar with the case. You should have deported her so that she could be alive today. Her parents would have appreciated that. And also Kayla Hamilton, who was brutally raped and murdered by a cartel member. Her mother came and spoke to us. She didn't deport him either. You let him in the country. You, Mr. Secretary, have allowed over 10 million illegal, probably higher than that could be closer to 15 million. We don't know. To invade our country, you've allowed the cartels to make billions and billions. As a matter of fact, you're probably the best business partner they could ever have. They make all this money in human trafficking and drug trafficking in our border. You've allowed approximately 300 Americans to be murdered every single day from fentanyl that comes across our border. And now you're aiding NGOs to steal our elections through your budget. I demand proof of citizenship in our elections. And that is something every single member of Congress should care about. We don't need illegal aliens voting in our elections. We're supposed to be here talking about your budget, but we're talking about how money is being used to make sure people come into our country are able to get a social security number in which they can register to vote. And on that note, Mr. Mayor, I demand that Chuck Schumer holds your impeachment trial in the Senate. Because that's exactly what we should be focused on right now.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand congresswoman known for her controversial statements, has just dropped a bombshell announcement that has left the internet buzzing. In a surprising turn of events, Marjorie Taylor Greene has revealed that she is pregnant. But here's the twist that nobody saw coming. She claims that the father of her unborn child is none other than the former president himself. Donald Trump. Yes, you heard that right. Marjorie Taylor Greene has publicly declared that she is expecting a baby with Donald Trump, sending social media into a frenzy of speculation and disbelief. The news has left many scratching their heads and others gasping in shock. While some may dismiss this revelation, as a mere publicity stunt, or a wild hoax, the implications are nothing short of extraordinary. Imagine the former leader of the free world allegedly fathering a child with a controversial congresswoman known for her unwavering support. Predictably, Trump has wasted no time in vehemently denying the claim, calling Marjorie Taylor Greene's announcement a diabolical lie and threatening legal action against her. He insists that their relationship is purely professional and accuses her of trying to tarnish his reputation. It emits the chaos and confusion, one question looms large. Is there any truth to Marjorie Taylor Greene's shocking revelation? Could this be a case of political intrigue, a scandalous affair, or perhaps just a cleverly orchestrated prank? As the nation waits with baited breath for further developments, one thing is for certain. Marjorie Taylor Greene's pregnancy bombshell has ignited a firestorm of controversy that shows no signs of a baiting.

So is American people's taxpayer dollars going to fund aid in Ukraine, but yet it's really funding something else that's happening maybe ending up in Democrat donors pockets. This conspiracy theory connecting Ukrainian aid to FTX was debunked, but she certainly did benefit from the war. In fact, she purchased stocks in a defense contractor just before slamming others for doing the exact same thing. I don't even own any stocks and I haven't all of 2023.

Let me tell you something, not one Republican member of our conference that I have spoken to has any idea what is in this foreign aid package that's going to give $60 billion to Ukraine. And that is even the leadership offices. They haven't heard from Mike Johnson on the details. We're reading about it in the news the same way the American people are, and it's outrageous. When you saw Zelensky right there on that interview talking about, oh, we're going to lose territory. Oh, we really need this money. This $60 billion should have been approved yesterday. Let me tell you, we are losing our country to the illegal invasion that's happening every single day at our southern border. And I am so pissed off about it because the American people are pissed off about it. And while our so-called Republican speaker of the house is only working with Chuck Schumer and Hawkeye Jeffries and Ukraine first, Mitch McConnell and the White House and Jake Sullivan who he talks to on the phone all the time, we are angry. And people have had it. We don't want $60 billion to go to Ukraine because as we slept last night, Tucker, we just went $40 billion more into debt. And that's because the interest in our debt is so huge and our debt is so massive. This is happening while we sleep every single night. So no, we don't want to send $60 billion to Ukraine. We want to put our country first. It's time to care about America. So, I mean, is it true? Do you think that the Republican speaker would bring this up at when your recess ends and get it passed without the majority of Republicans? But with Democrats, could that actually happen? Yeah. Yeah, because that's what he's planning to do. Here's what I've been told. Well, first off, let's go back, Tucker. The last vote that we had on any Ukraine funding was on September 28th of 2023. That was only months ago. And that vote only 101 Republicans voted yes for $300 million. $300 million to go to Ukraine. And that was because I pitched an enormous fit and said, take this money out of our Department of Defense. We should not be funding a foreign war in order to fund our military. That's completely wrong. And our military, their mission is stated on their website is to put our national security first. It's all about our national security. Fighting a proxy war with Russia in Ukraine, which is a non-NATO member nation, is not protecting America's national security interest. It doesn't protect the United States of America. As a matter of fact, that pushes us closer and closer to World War III. So, we had that vote on September 28th, 2023. 117 Republicans voted no. That was the majority of the majority. Every single Democrat voted yes. Every single one. They had zero Democrats vote no. Our Republican speaker of the House is planning to suspend the rules next week. He is planning to not put this bill through the Rules Committee. He's not going to allow us to do any amendments. Amendments are our way of changing a bill. Amendments are our way of putting our district's interest, who we represent. That's our job title, representative. It's our way of changing a bill. My Johnson is going to tie our hands behind our backs and not allow us to do that. As he brings that bill to the floor, every Democrat will vote for it. And a small portion of Republicans, less than the majority, will vote for it as well. And this isn't a Republican speaker we have right now. This is a Democrat speaker of the House, because there is zero daylight between what Nancy Pelosi did last Congress. And what Mike Johnson is doing now is our so-called Republican speaker of the House. It's just an amazing thing to see. Will he take a call from you? I'm planning to speak with him on Friday, and I'm very much looking forward to that. It's just interesting that he's talking and a lot of people in the media are talking. We haven't been able to talk to, but to Zelensky, who's a foreigner with his own interests, of course, but not an American. And certainly not, we hope a voter in this country. But all these people take calls from Zelensky and are swayed by him. Is it a little weird to see an American speaker of the House pay closer attention to a foreign leader or a number of different foreign leaders than he would to his own voters and colleagues in the House and our legislative body? Yeah, absolutely, especially considering Mike Johnson has completely changed his character in a matter of about five months after he has become speaker of the House. Johnson is a Christian. He called himself a conservative always has been. He's a Republican member. But yet here we are after the many best was passed just almost two weeks ago in Washington. And now with the $60 billion going to a war in Ukraine that Americans 70% of Americans do not support it. That's the most recent polling. 70% of Americans and the majority of our majority of Republicans do not support funding Ukraine. People want to see a peace deal in Ukraine, not murdering more Ukrainians and more Russians. This needs to end. But no, Mike Johnson has has made a complete departure of who he is and what he stands for. And to the point where people are literally asking, is he blackmailed? What is wrong with him? Because he's completely disconnected with what we want. Do you think he is being blackmailed? I have no idea.",subjective,foreign aid

Mr. Mayor, we do not have a country without a secure border. And we cannot have a safe country. We cannot protect our own democracy without protecting our elections. That is a fact. The open border is the number one issue across America and pull after pull. And that is exactly why this committee impeached you. Mr. Secretary, the oversight project released a bombshell report last night on your connection to the dark money in geo-industrial complex of illegal immigration. I know you saw this from one of my colleagues just earlier. They found flyers throughout the Resource Center, Matamoris, Refugee Camp in Mexico telling illegal aliens, reminder to vote for President Biden when you are in the United States. We need another four years of his term to stay open. I witnessed this saw the flyers also being handed out to migrants who were using RCM for assistance in coming to the United States. In an audio recording, the founder of RCM Gabby Zavala, by the way, we maybe should subpoena her to the committee, agreed that they need to help as many people as possible before President Trump gets reelected. RCM is an operation that houses functions for the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, which helps migrants in or the United States, and you're familiar with their work. We know that you served as a former board member of this group that funds illegal immigration. And they're very proud of you, Mr. Secretary. They congratulate you on your nomination. You worked as a board member of an NGO that is working in conjunction with other NGOs, which are not only financing the invasion of the country, but also telling illegal aliens to vote in the United States elections. They are telling illegal aliens, non-citizens, to come vote for Joe Biden. That's your boss. This is corruption at the deepest level. As a matter of fact, I would call it treason. It's treason because these people have declared war on our citizens by raping our women, our children, and murdering people. Like Lake in Riley, you're familiar with her, right? Congressman, our part breaking. Are you familiar with Lake in Riley? I am familiar with the case. You should have deported her so that she could be alive today. Her parents would have appreciated that. And also Kayla Hamilton, who was brutally raped and murdered by a cartel member. Her mother came and spoke to us. She didn't deport him either. You let him in the country. You, Mr. Secretary, have allowed over 10 million illegal, probably higher than that could be closer to 15 million. We don't know. To invade our country, you've allowed the cartels to make billions and billions. As a matter of fact, you're probably the best business partner they could ever have. They make all this money in human trafficking and drug trafficking in our border. You've allowed approximately 300 Americans to be murdered every single day from fentanyl that comes across our border. And now you're aiding NGOs to steal our elections through your budget. I demand proof of citizenship in our elections. And that is something every single member of Congress should care about. We don't need illegal aliens voting in our elections. We're supposed to be here talking about your budget, but we're talking about how money is being used to make sure people come into our country are able to get a social security number in which they can register to vote. And on that note, Mr. Mayor, I demand that Chuck Schumer holds your impeachment trial in the Senate. Because that's exactly what we should be focused on right now.

Let me tell you something, not one Republican member of our conference that I have spoken to has any idea what is in this foreign aid package that's going to give $60 billion to Ukraine. And that is even the leadership offices. They haven't heard from Mike Johnson on the details. We're reading about it in the news the same way the American people are, and it's outrageous. When you saw Zelensky right there on that interview talking about, oh, we're going to lose territory. Oh, we really need this money. This $60 billion should have been approved yesterday. Let me tell you, we are losing our country to the illegal invasion that's happening every single day at our southern border. And I am so pissed off about it because the American people are pissed off about it. And while our so-called Republican speaker of the house is only working with Chuck Schumer and Hawkeye Jeffries and Ukraine first, Mitch McConnell and the White House and Jake Sullivan who he talks to on the phone all the time, we are angry. And people have had it. We don't want $60 billion to go to Ukraine because as we slept last night, Tucker, we just went $40 billion more into debt. And that's because the interest in our debt is so huge and our debt is so massive. This is happening while we sleep every single night. So no, we don't want to send $60 billion to Ukraine. We want to put our country first. It's time to care about America. So, I mean, is it true? Do you think that the Republican speaker would bring this up at when your recess ends and get it passed without the majority of Republicans? But with Democrats, could that actually happen? Yeah. Yeah, because that's what he's planning to do. Here's what I've been told. Well, first off, let's go back, Tucker. The last vote that we had on any Ukraine funding was on September 28th of 2023. That was only months ago. And that vote only 101 Republicans voted yes for $300 million. $300 million to go to Ukraine. And that was because I pitched an enormous fit and said, take this money out of our Department of Defense. We should not be funding a foreign war in order to fund our military. That's completely wrong. And our military, their mission is stated on their website is to put our national security first. It's all about our national security. Fighting a proxy war with Russia in Ukraine, which is a non-NATO member nation, is not protecting America's national security interest. It doesn't protect the United States of America. As a matter of fact, that pushes us closer and closer to World War III. So, we had that vote on September 28th, 2023. 117 Republicans voted no. That was the majority of the majority. Every single Democrat voted yes. Every single one. They had zero Democrats vote no. Our Republican speaker of the House is planning to suspend the rules next week. He is planning to not put this bill through the Rules Committee. He's not going to allow us to do any amendments. Amendments are our way of changing a bill. Amendments are our way of putting our district's interest, who we represent. That's our job title, representative. It's our way of changing a bill. My Johnson is going to tie our hands behind our backs and not allow us to do that. As he brings that bill to the floor, every Democrat will vote for it. And a small portion of Republicans, less than the majority, will vote for it as well. And this isn't a Republican speaker we have right now. This is a Democrat speaker of the House, because there is zero daylight between what Nancy Pelosi did last Congress. And what Mike Johnson is doing now is our so-called Republican speaker of the House. It's just an amazing thing to see. Will he take a call from you? I'm planning to speak with him on Friday, and I'm very much looking forward to that. It's just interesting that he's talking and a lot of people in the media are talking. We haven't been able to talk to, but to Zelensky, who's a foreigner with his own interests, of course, but not an American. And certainly not, we hope a voter in this country. But all these people take calls from Zelensky and are swayed by him. Is it a little weird to see an American speaker of the House pay closer attention to a foreign leader or a number of different foreign leaders than he would to his own voters and colleagues in the House and our legislative body? Yeah, absolutely, especially considering Mike Johnson has completely changed his character in a matter of about five months after he has become speaker of the House. Johnson is a Christian. He called himself a conservative always has been. He's a Republican member. But yet here we are after the many best was passed just almost two weeks ago in Washington. And now with the $60 billion going to a war in Ukraine that Americans 70% of Americans do not support it. That's the most recent polling. 70% of Americans and the majority of our majority of Republicans do not support funding Ukraine. People want to see a peace deal in Ukraine, not murdering more Ukrainians and more Russians. This needs to end. But no, Mike Johnson has has made a complete departure of who he is and what he stands for. And to the point where people are literally asking, is he blackmailed? What is wrong with him? Because he's completely disconnected with what we want. Do you think he is being blackmailed? I have no idea.",subjective,foreign aid

In a surprising turn of events, Marjorie Taylor Greene has revealed that she is pregnant. But here's the twist that nobody saw coming. She claims that the father of her unborn child is none other than the former president himself. Donald Trump. Yes, you heard that right. Marjorie Taylor Greene has publicly declared that she is expecting a baby with Donald Trump, sending social media into a frenzy of speculation and disbelief. The news has left many scratching their heads and others gasping in shock. While some may dismiss this revelation, as a mere publicity stunt, or a wild hoax, the implications are nothing short of extraordinary. Imagine the former leader of the free world allegedly fathering a child with a controversial congresswoman known for her unwavering support. Predictably, Trump has wasted no time in vehemently denying the claim, calling Marjorie Taylor Greene's announcement a diabolical lie and threatening legal action against her. He insists that their relationship is purely professional and accuses her of trying to tarnish his reputation. It emits the chaos and confusion, one question looms large. Is there any truth to Marjorie Taylor Greene's shocking revelation? Could this be a case of political intrigue, a scandalous affair, or perhaps just a cleverly orchestrated prank? As the nation waits with baited breath for further developments, one thing is for certain. Marjorie Taylor Greene's pregnancy bombshell has ignited a firestorm of controversy that shows no signs of a baiting.

It's not just shady insider trading where politicians can benefit by acting and see interest their constituents to really find out what's going on behind the scenes of some of the seemingly insane decisions the politicians make. You have to follow the money. But let's talk about the aid to Ukraine. Here in the news, we're just finding out about the situation with FTX and the cryptocurrency. So is American people's taxpayer dollars going to fund aid in Ukraine, but yet it's really funding something else that's happening maybe ending up in Democrat donors pockets. This conspiracy theory connecting Ukrainian aid to FTX was debunked, but she certainly did benefit from the war. In fact, she purchased stocks in a defense contractor just before slamming others for doing the exact same thing. I don't even own any stocks and I haven't all of 2023.

Let me tell you something, not one Republican member of our conference that I have spoken to has any idea what is in this foreign aid package that's going to give $60 billion to Ukraine. And that is even the leadership offices. They haven't heard from Mike Johnson on the details. We're reading about it in the news the same way the American people are, and it's outrageous. When you saw Zelensky right there on that interview talking about, oh, we're going to lose territory. Oh, we really need this money. This $60 billion should have been approved yesterday. Let me tell you, we are losing our country to the illegal invasion that's happening every single day at our southern border. And I am so pissed off about it because the American people are pissed off about it. And while our so-called Republican speaker of the house is only working with Chuck Schumer and Hawkeye Jeffries and Ukraine first, Mitch McConnell and the White House and Jake Sullivan who he talks to on the phone all the time, we are angry. And people have had it. We don't want $60 billion to go to Ukraine because as we slept last night, Tucker, we just went $40 billion more into debt. And that's because the interest in our debt is so huge and our debt is so massive. This is happening while we sleep every single night. So no, we don't want to send $60 billion to Ukraine. We want to put our country first. It's time to care about America. So, I mean, is it true? Do you think that the Republican speaker would bring this up at when your recess ends and get it passed without the majority of Republicans? But with Democrats, could that actually happen? Yeah. Yeah, because that's what he's planning to do. Here's what I've been told. Well, first off, let's go back, Tucker. The last vote that we had on any Ukraine funding was on September 28th of 2023. That was only months ago. And that vote only 101 Republicans voted yes for $300 million. $300 million to go to Ukraine. And that was because I pitched an enormous fit and said, take this money out of our Department of Defense. We should not be funding a foreign war in order to fund our military. That's completely wrong. And our military, their mission is stated on their website is to put our national security first. It's all about our national security. Fighting a proxy war with Russia in Ukraine, which is a non-NATO member nation, is not protecting America's national security interest. It doesn't protect the United States of America. As a matter of fact, that pushes us closer and closer to World War III. So, we had that vote on September 28th, 2023. 117 Republicans voted no. That was the majority of the majority. Every single Democrat voted yes. Every single one. They had zero Democrats vote no. Our Republican speaker of the House is planning to suspend the rules next week. He is planning to not put this bill through the Rules Committee. He's not going to allow us to do any amendments. Amendments are our way of changing a bill. Amendments are our way of putting our district's interest, who we represent. That's our job title, representative. It's our way of changing a bill. My Johnson is going to tie our hands behind our backs and not allow us to do that. As he brings that bill to the floor, every Democrat will vote for it. And a small portion of Republicans, less than the majority, will vote for it as well. And this isn't a Republican speaker we have right now. This is a Democrat speaker of the House, because there is zero daylight between what Nancy Pelosi did last Congress. And what Mike Johnson is doing now is our so-called Republican speaker of the House. It's just an amazing thing to see. Will he take a call from you? I'm planning to speak with him on Friday, and I'm very much looking forward to that. It's just interesting that he's talking and a lot of people in the media are talking. We haven't been able to talk to, but to Zelensky, who's a foreigner with his own interests, of course, but not an American. And certainly not, we hope a voter in this country. But all these people take calls from Zelensky and are swayed by him. Is it a little weird to see an American speaker of the House pay closer attention to a foreign leader or a number of different foreign leaders than he would to his own voters and colleagues in the House and our legislative body? Yeah, absolutely, especially considering Mike Johnson has completely changed his character in a matter of about five months after he has become speaker of the House. Johnson is a Christian. He called himself a conservative always has been. He's a Republican member. But yet here we are after the many best was passed just almost two weeks ago in Washington. And now with the $60 billion going to a war in Ukraine that Americans 70% of Americans do not support it. That's the most recent polling. 70% of Americans and the majority of our majority of Republicans do not support funding Ukraine. People want to see a peace deal in Ukraine, not murdering more Ukrainians and more Russians. This needs to end. But no, Mike Johnson has has made a complete departure of who he is and what he stands for. And to the point where people are literally asking, is he blackmailed? What is wrong with him? Because he's completely disconnected with what we want. Do you think he is being blackmailed? I have no idea.",subjective,foreign aid

Kevin McCarthy, you're able now to sit back and watch which is taking place in Congress, not just the House but all of Congress. And you can see the glide path is basically where the Democrats want it right now. We're going to have to really show up in big numbers and change the electoral map, increase the numbers in the House, win the Senate, and elect Donald Trump. We really have any hope of saving this country, aren't we? I mean, the Democrats are not interested in compromise. They're interested in monopoly power. My big fear is if people sit back, they sit back, think about how much further the Democrats would go. Republicans have the House. They're able to stop a lot. But I will tell you this for everybody sitting at home, this is a unique opportunity. If the election was held today, President Trump would win. Really on the merits of people can measure what we've been able to accomplish. But really on the port card of Joe Biden itself, war around the world, a border that's wide open, fit and all, killing Americans. We had five embassies have to evacuate. The decisions he has made has harmed us for decades, the way he got out of Afghanistan, attacking our own allies, walking back our support for Israel, which we have to as Americans stay firm with the only democracy, with our truest of friends in Israel. But what you find, too, is I believe the Republicans can pick up the Senate, one of the best maps they have. But even in the House, we have an opportunity to gain seats. It's easier to win seats in this election than it was in the last two when we won. And if you look at voter registration, Republican numbers are up in Pennsylvania. They're up in Florida. They're up in a number of these swing states. So if we do our jobs and bring more people than just Republicans, invite everybody that wants to have a secure border, we watched earlier this week inflation is back based upon democratic policies. We've watched crime continue to rise in our streets. We know America can be better. We know America is too big and too great to settle for something so small as these democratic policies.",subjective,political reform

McCarthy strongly denied those remarks, but then the New York Times posted the audio recordings. Here's ABC's Chief Washington correspondent Jonathan Carr. When the New York Times reported that Republican leader Kevin McCarthy was so outraged by Donald Trump's behavior on January 6th that he wanted him to resign, McCarthy flatly denied it, calling the report, quote, totally false and wrong. But now the reporters behind the story have presented proof McCarthy's own voice. Here talking about Trump on a call with Republican leaders four days after the attack on the Capitol. And I've had it with this guy. And a day later McCarthy said this in a call with House Republicans. But let me be very clear to all of you and I've been very clear to the president. He bears responsibilities for his words and actions, no offense or buts. I ask him personally today, does he hold responsibility for what happened? Does he feel bad about what happened? He told me he does have some responsibility for what happened. And he need to acknowledge that. The tape is from New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns backing up reporting from their forthcoming book, This Will Not Pass. When they first reported this week that McCarthy told fellow Republicans he planned to call Trump and tell him he should resign. The Republican leader spokesperson claimed, quote, McCarthy never said he'd call Trump to say he should resign. But listen to the tape. McCarthy first talks about the certainty of impeachment passing the House and maybe the Senate and even raises the possibility of Pence pardoning Trump if he resigned. When I think I'm going to do, I'm going to call him. This is what I think. He's already passed the House. I think there's a chance you'll pass the Senate or even really go. I think there's a lot of different limitations for that. Now, I haven't had a discussion with them that if you get resigned, would it not happen? Now, this is one personal fear I have. I do not want to get in any conversation about Pence pardoning. I've got another really discussion I would have with him is that I think this will pass. And it will be my recommendation we should resign.",subjective,trump res

Born in Bakersfield, California, in 1965, McCarthy is the son of a firefighter and was the first in his family to attend college. He earned his BA in marketing in 1989 and an MBA in 1994 from California State University Bakersfield. McCarthy began his political career in 2000 when he was elected as a trustee to the Kern Community College District. He then served in the California State Assembly from 2002 to 2006, becoming the Republican leader during his freshman term in 2004. In 2006, he was elected to the US House of Representatives. In Congress, McCarthy has held several leadership positions. He served as Chief Deputy Whip from 2009 to 2011, House Majority Whip from 2011 to 2014, and House Majority Leader from 2014 to 2019. Following the retirement of Speaker Paul Ryan in 2019, McCarthy was elected as the House Minority Leader, a position he held until 2023. In January 2023, McCarthy was elected Speaker of the House. However, his tenure was short-lived, and he was ousted from the position later that year. Despite these challenges, McCarthy has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and continues to represent California's 23rd District.",objective,american politics

Born in Bakersfield, California, in 1965, McCarthy is the son of a firefighter and was the first in his family to attend college. He earned his BA in marketing in 1989 and an MBA in 1994 from California State University Bakersfield. McCarthy began his political career in 2000 when he was elected as a trustee to the Kern Community College District. He then served in the California State Assembly from 2002 to 2006, becoming the Republican leader during his freshman term in 2004. In 2006, he was elected to the US House of Representatives. In Congress, McCarthy has held several leadership positions. He served as Chief Deputy Whip from 2009 to 2011, House Majority Whip from 2011 to 2014, and House Majority Leader from 2014 to 2019. Following the retirement of Speaker Paul Ryan in 2019, McCarthy was elected as the House Minority Leader, a position he held until 2023. In January 2023, McCarthy was elected Speaker of the House. However, his tenure was short-lived, and he was ousted from the position later that year. Despite these challenges, McCarthy has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and continues to represent California's 23rd District.",objective,american politics

Kevin McCarthy, you're able now to sit back and watch which is taking place in Congress, not just the House but all of Congress. And you can see the glide path is basically where the Democrats want it right now. We're going to have to really show up in big numbers and change the electoral map, increase the numbers in the House, win the Senate, and elect Donald Trump. We really have any hope of saving this country, aren't we? I mean, the Democrats are not interested in compromise. They're interested in monopoly power. My big fear is if people sit back, they sit back, think about how much further the Democrats would go. Republicans have the House. They're able to stop a lot. But I will tell you this for everybody sitting at home, this is a unique opportunity. If the election was held today, President Trump would win. Really on the merits of people can measure what we've been able to accomplish. But really on the port card of Joe Biden itself, war around the world, a border that's wide open, fit and all, killing Americans. We had five embassies have to evacuate. The decisions he has made has harmed us for decades, the way he got out of Afghanistan, attacking our own allies, walking back our support for Israel, which we have to as Americans stay firm with the only democracy, with our truest of friends in Israel. But what you find, too, is I believe the Republicans can pick up the Senate, one of the best maps they have. But even in the House, we have an opportunity to gain seats. It's easier to win seats in this election than it was in the last two when we won. And if you look at voter registration, Republican numbers are up in Pennsylvania. They're up in Florida. They're up in a number of these swing states. So if we do our jobs and bring more people than just Republicans, invite everybody that wants to have a secure border, we watched earlier this week inflation is back based upon democratic policies.

McCarthy strongly denied those remarks, but then the New York Times posted the audio recordings. Here's ABC's Chief Washington correspondent Jonathan Carr. When the New York Times reported that Republican leader Kevin McCarthy was so outraged by Donald Trump's behavior on January 6th that he wanted him to resign, McCarthy flatly denied it, calling the report, quote, totally false and wrong. But now the reporters behind the story have presented proof McCarthy's own voice. Here talking about Trump on a call with Republican leaders four days after the attack on the Capitol.

When they first reported this week that McCarthy told fellow Republicans he planned to call Trump and tell him he should resign.

That's built into the TV. So what we can prove here is that with a little bit of extra code, we can turn the camera on in your browser. Wow. And while this is evident to you right here, because we, because we've designed it that way, this is something that we can do invisibly. And actually, I have the camera running behind the web page that you're, that you're looking at. So what this means is I could be sitting here watching TV from my, from my bedroom. And you could be anywhere in the world looking at this image of me watching. Yep. I could be sitting on a laptop in a cafe in Paris. And as long as I have a network connection, I'd be able to get into your TV and access the camera. The kind of scary things about it is that it doesn't actually give any indication that the camera's on. And there's no little LED that shows up when the camera's on. So we could actually be watching you and you never even know. What is a smart TV? And why is it a playground essentially for hackers? It's a computer. So instead of just being a tube and some other electronics, now it has a web browser. And it has a lot of devices running Linux. But the real danger is when people start using smart TVs for things like online banking, we can take a popular bank address and translate that into a different IP address, to a site that directs to a site that we control. So it may look like your bank's login, but you're actually entering a user and a password that goes to us instead of your bank. In a statement to CNN Money, Samsung says it takes consumer privacy very seriously. The camera can be turned into the bezel of the TV so that the lens is covered or disabled by pushing the camera inside the bezel. The TV owner can also unplug the TV from the home network when the smart TV features are not in use.

Charlie Kirk follows us at noon. Populous nationalism served up hot. Lot to go on today. But so big after that, we're back five to seven a night. We've got a lot of stuff rolling. Last stuff going on on this day of commemoration of the beginning of the American involvement in World War II. And what would the honored dead? How would they weigh in my dross? How have we honored their sacrifice? It's not just once a year going to Memorial Day or Pearl Harbor and you lay a wreath that you're going to put the wreaths up at Arlington National Cemetery or the Military Cemetery. And these are important civic evolutions to do. There's no doubt about that. And to pass that tradition on to your children and your grandchildren. That's to be commended. We need to do that. But there's something different, deeper. If to honor those dead, you don't leave on the 15th of December. I hate to say that. You don't. There has to be, and I wasn't raised like this. I know this audience wasn't raised like this. And you're not hardwired like this. This is why this audience has such an impact because you will get to the ramparts and you'll give them the old what for. And they hate that. They hate it, particularly because they know that you've done the work on this show and that you're informed. And people responded that. Respect. And remember, that was Obama's situation in 08. They actually targeted those people in neighborhoods that people looked up to. It's the Kulaks. It's the head peasant. This is why one of the Russians, when the Bolsheviks came into Ukraine in the 1930s, it was to kill, they take out the Kulaks first. They take out the head peasant in the village. That people look up to it. My parents always thought of them as Kulaks. They were the simple people and the thing. But people kind of looked up to them because they were squared away. My mom had this focus. You've got to get all five kids to college, right? They never, nobody ever went to college. She went, oh, sister went first, but they got to graduate. You got to get there and you got to graduate on a time and you got to do it with as a de minimus debt as possible. And they get on in the world. That's the Kulaks. That's what they're trying to, that's what, that's what every revolutionary efforts ever gone at. Get to the family, you get to the Kulaks, you break the traditional family, and then we got it. That's what they're doing here. So what would you say to them? Your pitch, not mine, not Tucker Carlson's, not Donald Trump's yours, yours. The only way this movement makes progress is work on oneself. That would be your own self. Because that what makes this movement stronger every day, collectively, collectively, is the individuals, the free men and women, of which they did not in a million years. If they came back from the dead, they would think they were on another planet when they saw the way this country's run. They saw what's happening in the schools. They see what's happened to the children. They see what's happened to the family. They see what's happened to the border. They see what's happened geopolitically. They see what's happened to the culture. They couldn't believe it. They would think, no. I tell you what they would say. They didn't die for this. No doubt about that. 1,000%. They would say that. So how do you have that conversation? How do you? You tell me. I did not for me to do it. It's not for Trump to do it. It's not for Tucker Carlson to do it. It's not for Dan Bonjina to do it. Our Alex Jones is for you. How do you have it? Say, look, it's not my responsibility. Is all this stuff going to no? It is yours. Once you take control and say, it is my responsibility. It is my task and purpose. Then we are going to make some progress. Because you can't count on them. They're going to go wheels up on the 15th. They're going to go back. They're going to go back. They're going to go, I don't know, co-dales. They're going to go back home. They're going to do all of it. Because it's just another day. We'll cut some deal. We'll spend more money. It's still modern monetary theory. It's all that. It's all that. And we'll be able to paper over. Because the printing machine still goes over treasurer over the Fed. They still print more fiancee on currency. You know, banning these crazies and actually, they're not there yet. They're a year away. They can't look at this as executive orders. Anybody I've explained to you as executive order is just an executive order. They didn't get a fairness opinion on. That OSCD and Damian write a thing to get off the differentiate of the first place. I'm not arguing we have to go back in the gold stand. I'm just saying to the process. Did you even know about that? You ever noticed when you go back and all the bad stuffs are happening in 1971 and you say, hey, you know, I see some pattern recognition, or what happened back then? over a weekend they just got us off the convertibility to gold. And I've read every book on the topic. I've read all the research papers on the topic. I still can't find the projection. And normally we do something that earth moving. You got projections all over the place. You're arguing about assumptions. Was this looking fine in the fifth year? What's the second order? Hit, we're gonna take the third order, the fourth order. None of that. Guys sitting around the Oval Office kind of shooting the breeze. You know why? They knew they weren't gonna bear the burden of it. That you were. That's why real wages have not increased for working class people. In this country from, I'm gonna give you a random date, 1971. So I can the French Revolution when they had everybody to get it to raise taxes to pay, because essentially a pay for the 100 year war, particularly the part in the United States called the American Revolution. To pay the bonds off that. And they said, hey, we gotta get it right together to raise taxes. And one of the CFO, the Treasury said, hey, what we should do is we should publish in these broadsheets the accounts of the country. And when they publish it, the people said, wow, we looked around, this is a paradise. It's a paradise that can generate a lot of cash. But it ain't being spent on us. It's being spent at Versailles. It's being spent on these aristocrats that are dancing around and doing all this. And that's when the revolution got real. That's when it came a little bit off the chain.

And you could be anywhere in the world looking at this image of me watching. Yep. I could be sitting on a laptop in a cafe in Paris. And as long as I have a network connection, I'd be able to get into your TV and access the camera.

So we could actually be watching you and you never even know. What is a smart TV? And why is it a playground essentially for hackers? It's a computer. So instead of just being a tube and some other electronics, now it has a web browser. And it has a lot of devices running Linux.

So it may look like your bank's login, but you're actually entering a user and a password that goes to us instead of your bank. In a statement to CNN Money, Samsung says it takes consumer privacy very seriously. The camera can be turned into the bezel of the TV so that the lens is covered or disabled by pushing the camera inside the bezel.

That's built into the TV. So what we can prove here is that with a little bit of extra code, we can turn the camera on in your browser. Wow. And while this is evident to you right here, because we, because we've designed it that way, this is something that we can do invisibly.

And you could be anywhere in the world looking at this image of me watching. Yep. I could be sitting on a laptop in a cafe in Paris. And as long as I have a network connection, I'd be able to get into your TV and access the camera. The kind of scary things about it is that it doesn't actually give any indication that the camera's on. And there's no little LED that shows up when the camera's on. So we could actually be watching you and you never even know. What is a smart TV? And why is it a playground essentially for hackers? It's a computer. So instead of just being a tube and some other electronics, now it has a web browser. And it has a lot of devices running Linux. But the real danger is when people start using smart TVs for things like online banking, we can take a popular bank address and translate that into a different IP address, to a site that directs to a site that we control. So it may look like your bank's login, but you're actually entering a user and a password that goes to us instead of your bank. In a statement to CNN Money, Samsung says it takes consumer privacy very seriously. The camera can be turned into the bezel of the TV so that the lens is covered or disabled by pushing the camera inside the bezel. The TV owner can also unplug the TV from the home network when the smart TV features are not in use. As an added precaution, we also recommend that customers use encrypted wireless access points when using connected devices. For those of us who are a little freaked out and maybe don't trust all these updates, what's the easiest fix?

I know this audience wasn't raised like this. And you're not hardwired like this.

They hate it, particularly because they know that you've done the work on this show and that you're informed. And people responded that. Respect. And remember, that was Obama's situation in 08. They actually targeted those people in neighborhoods that people looked up to. It's the Kulaks. It's the head peasant. This is why one of the Russians, when the Bolsheviks came into Ukraine in the 1930s, it was to kill, they take out the Kulaks first. They take out the head peasant in the village. That people look up to it. My parents always thought of them as Kulaks. They were the simple people and the thing. But people kind of looked up to them because they were squared away. My mom had this focus. You've got to get all five kids to college, right? They never, nobody ever went to college. She went, oh, sister went first, but they got to graduate. You got to get there and you got to graduate on a time and you got to do it with as a de minimus debt as possible. And they get on in the world. That's the Kulaks. That's what they're trying to, that's what, that's what every revolutionary efforts ever gone at. Get to the family, you get to the Kulaks, you break the traditional family, and then we got it. That's what they're doing here. So what would you say to them? Your pitch, not mine, not Tucker Carlson's, not Donald Trump's yours, yours. The only way this movement makes progress is work on oneself. That would be your own self. Because that what makes this movement stronger every day, collectively, collectively, is the individuals, the free men and women, of which they did not in a million years. If they came back from the dead, they would think they were on another planet when they saw the way this country's run. They saw what's happening in the schools. They see what's happened to the children. They see what's happened to the family. They see what's happened to the border. They see what's happened geopolitically. They see what's happened to the culture. They couldn't believe it. They would think, no. I tell you what they would say. They didn't die for this. No doubt about that. 1,000%. They would say that.

It is my task and purpose. Then we are going to make some progress. Because you can't count on them. They're going to go wheels up on the 15th. They're going to go back. They're going to go back. They're going to go, I don't know, co-dales. They're going to go back home. They're going to do all of it. Because it's just another day. We'll cut some deal. We'll spend more money. It's still modern monetary theory. It's all that. It's all that. And we'll be able to paper over. Because the printing machine still goes over treasurer over the Fed. They still print more fiancee on currency. You know, banning these crazies and actually, they're not there yet. They're a year away. They can't look at this as executive orders. Anybody I've explained to you as executive order is just an executive order. They didn't get a fairness opinion on. That OSCD and Damian write a thing to get off the differentiate of the first place. I'm not arguing we have to go back in the gold stand. I'm just saying to the process. Did you even know about that? You ever noticed when you go back and all the bad stuffs are happening in 1971 and you say, hey, you know, I see some pattern recognition, or what happened back then? over a weekend they just got us off the convertibility to gold. And I've read every book on the topic. I've read all the research papers on the topic. I still can't find the projection. And normally we do something that earth moving. You got projections all over the place. You're arguing about assumptions. Was this looking fine in the fifth year? What's the second order? Hit, we're gonna take the third order, the fourth order.

And when they publish it, the people said, wow, we looked around, this is a paradise. It's a paradise that can generate a lot of cash. But it ain't being spent on us. It's being spent at Versailles. It's being spent on these aristocrats that are dancing around and doing all this. And that's when the revolution got real. That's when it came a little bit off the chain.

That's built into the TV. So what we can prove here is that with a little bit of extra code, we can turn the camera on in your browser. Wow. And while this is evident to you right here, because we, because we've designed it that way, this is something that we can do invisibly.

And you could be anywhere in the world looking at this image of me watching. Yep. I could be sitting on a laptop in a cafe in Paris. And as long as I have a network connection, I'd be able to get into your TV and access the camera. The kind of scary things about it is that it doesn't actually give any indication that the camera's on. And there's no little LED that shows up when the camera's on. So we could actually be watching you and you never even know. What is a smart TV? And why is it a playground essentially for hackers? It's a computer. So instead of just being a tube and some other electronics, now it has a web browser. And it has a lot of devices running Linux. But the real danger is when people start using smart TVs for things like online banking, we can take a popular bank address and translate that into a different IP address, to a site that directs to a site that we control. So it may look like your bank's login, but you're actually entering a user and a password that goes to us instead of your bank. In a statement to CNN Money, Samsung says it takes consumer privacy very seriously. The camera can be turned into the bezel of the TV so that the lens is covered or disabled by pushing the camera inside the bezel. The TV owner can also unplug the TV from the home network when the smart TV features are not in use. As an added precaution, we also recommend that customers use encrypted wireless access points when using connected devices. For those of us who are a little freaked out and maybe don't trust all these updates, what's the easiest fix?

I know this audience wasn't raised like this. And you're not hardwired like this. This is why this audience has such an impact because you will get to the ramparts and you'll give them the old what for. And they hate that. They hate it, particularly because they know that you've done the work on this show and that you're informed. And people responded that. Respect. And remember, that was Obama's situation in 08. They actually targeted those people in neighborhoods that people looked up to. It's the Kulaks. It's the head peasant. This is why one of the Russians, when the Bolsheviks came into Ukraine in the 1930s, it was to kill, they take out the Kulaks first. They take out the head peasant in the village. That people look up to it. My parents always thought of them as Kulaks. They were the simple people and the thing. But people kind of looked up to them because they were squared away. My mom had this focus. You've got to get all five kids to college, right? They never, nobody ever went to college. She went, oh, sister went first, but they got to graduate. You got to get there and you got to graduate on a time and you got to do it with as a de minimus debt as possible. And they get on in the world. That's the Kulaks. That's what they're trying to, that's what, that's what every revolutionary efforts ever gone at. Get to the family, you get to the Kulaks, you break the traditional family, and then we got it. That's what they're doing here. So what would you say to them? Your pitch, not mine, not Tucker Carlson's, not Donald Trump's yours, yours. The only way this movement makes progress is work on oneself. That would be your own self. Because that what makes this movement stronger every day, collectively, collectively, is the individuals, the free men and women, of which they did not in a million years. If they came back from the dead, they would think they were on another planet when they saw the way this country's run. They saw what's happening in the schools. They see what's happened to the children. They see what's happened to the family. They see what's happened to the border. They see what's happened geopolitically. They see what's happened to the culture. They couldn't believe it. They would think, no. I tell you what they would say. They didn't die for this. No doubt about that. 1,000%. They would say that.

Our Alex Jones is for you. How do you have it? Say, look, it's not my responsibility. Is all this stuff going to no? It is yours. Once you take control and say, it is my responsibility. It is my task and purpose. Then we are going to make some progress. Because you can't count on them. They're going to go wheels up on the 15th. They're going to go back. They're going to go back. They're going to go, I don't know, co-dales. They're going to go back home. They're going to do all of it. Because it's just another day. We'll cut some deal. We'll spend more money. It's still modern monetary theory. It's all that. It's all that. And we'll be able to paper over. Because the printing machine still goes over treasurer over the Fed. They still print more fiancee on currency. You know, banning these crazies and actually, they're not there yet. They're a year away. They can't look at this as executive orders. Anybody I've explained to you as executive order is just an executive order. They didn't get a fairness opinion on. That OSCD and Damian write a thing to get off the differentiate of the first place. I'm not arguing we have to go back in the gold stand. I'm just saying to the process. Did you even know about that? You ever noticed when you go back and all the bad stuffs are happening in 1971 and you say, hey, you know, I see some pattern recognition, or what happened back then? over a weekend they just got us off the convertibility to gold. And I've read every book on the topic. I've read all the research papers on the topic. I still can't find the projection. And normally we do something that earth moving. You got projections all over the place. You're arguing about assumptions. Was this looking fine in the fifth year? What's the second order? Hit, we're gonna take the third order, the fourth order.

And when they publish it, the people said, wow, we looked around, this is a paradise. It's a paradise that can generate a lot of cash. But it ain't being spent on us. It's being spent at Versailles.

We are live at the planet Hollywood on the strip in Las Vegas, Nevada, here at the Restoring National Confidence Conference, put on by Turning Point USA. Yersley was pretty explosive, ended with some power speeches by Michael and Del Don Jr., Donald Trump Jr., and of course Charlie Kirk. But Yersley was a tremendous day of organizing. What this is, you've got, I don't know, 5, 600 of precinct committee men. You've got Republican County Chairman. You have, I think we've got 50 or 60, maybe even more Republican National Committee people here. Nobody's happy at all with how the RNC's been run. This is a organizing meeting for the next couple of days, organizing committee to make sure that we get organized for 2024. You saw right there just absolutely incredible is first time in 100 years. First time in 100 years, we're going to have impeached today a vote in the Homeland Security Council. They're impeaching, by the way, we're here live. Got a great group here of Turning Point USA that getting all jacked up, getting ready to go in for the conference. There's going to be an impeachment vote today with Mayorkas that impeachment vote. First time in 100 years, a cabinet secretary is being impeached. And here's what we've got to understand. The Mayorkas position, Homeland Security, that's absolutely central to the Senate bill that they're putting up. The Senate is putting up a bill today. The Senate is putting up a bill today or over the next couple of days you get to read the text. This is the one that Langford and the other traders have been working on. That bill is absolutely the only way can be executed is the chairman of the Secretary of Homeland Security. So before the text of the bill gets released, this Anastie bill that President Trump is adamant about should not be passed, the chief person to execute it is being impeached. His number one crime, the high crimes and misdemeanors number one is failure to execute the laws are on the books. I want you to think of the absurdity of this that after a one year process, the House Homeland Security Committee is putting forward for the first time in 100 years to impeach a cabinet secretary for breaking the law. What laws are he breaking? Essentially all the immigration laws. He's being impeached for that. The Senate, and this is how over the top and crazy it is, is putting forward an Anastie bill to essentially codify the invasion of our country. In that codification, the only control mechanism they have is the Secretary of Homeland Security who would execute all of these various changes to the Amnesty laws. It's absurd on the face of it. As President Trump said, as Speaker Johnson said, as MTG and many others have said, we have all the laws on the books we need today to shut down the border. Speaker Johnson reiterated this yesterday, that's why Speaker Johnson, we begged you not to go forward with the CR. Either shut down the border or shut down the government. We have enough laws in the books today. President Trump reiterated this yesterday. President Trump reiterated this that all you have to do is execute it right there. When President Trump was in, he closed the border to this type of mass asylum, this type of mass, illegal invasion, illegal immigration. He shut it down okay, he shut it down with the laws are on the books. We don't need any more laws now to have HR two and these other things at the House is pass to be terrific. But that's just additional bells and whistles. That's on the margin and can make it better just to reiterate. What reiterate president Trump said yesterday we have all the laws in the books we need. This Langford bill what he's been working on is a complete sellout of the country, a sellout of the nation. It is a codification of a mass invasion of the country. It would essentially leave 8 to 10 to 12 U.S. tied bensmen. Not the 30 or 40 million that have been here for decades and decades and decades. I'm talking about just since Joe Biden's reign of terror. The illegitimate regime of Joe Biden. When Joe Biden came in what he's done to the board has brought anywhere from 8 to 12 million illegal alien invaders here a massive increase to our federal spending to take care of it all. That bill is to codify. That bill is to put in place laws that would protect that. It would give work permits. I think the six million people immediately the thing is a total complete disaster and we don't need any of it. And to show that, my Yorkers will get in peach today first time in 100 years. Now I want to go back to the cold open. I understand it. Ben Burkram is over there winding the entire time. Hey, I can't say I can't. We must make sure you understand the narratives being pushed by the left. Now, here's Morning Mika. Quite important. I think 1957 Arkansas, the desegregation fight of the, I think the high schools there, present Eisenhower called in the 101st Airborne. But he also federalized the National Guard. What you're seeing in Texas. At the same time that they're coming forward and they're coming forward with this and the bill, this and just bill the exact same time they're coming forward with the and the bill. What do you have? You have the federal government going down to the state of Texas and the state of Texas saying they're trying to protect around border. Abbott, who's no fire breather, finally calls out people to help protect the border to put razor wire up, particularly down at points like Eagle Pass, Texas. What does the federal government do? They go the Supreme Court to get a ruling that they can go and cut the bob wire and let the invaders in and process more. And remember, this entire bill that you're seeing, the Langford bill is just about processing. It's not about detention and deportation. Todd Bendvich says the 2D's detention and deportation, that's not in this bill. All this is is to process more. The federal government's down to cut the razor wire because the state of Texas protecting their sovereignty and the sovereignty of their people. And what is the morning Joe come up with right away? The time that the President of the United States in an emergency about this situation down in Arkansas in the 1950s about segregation of the schools, federalize the National Guard and they say, hey, he's not threatening to do it. He hasn't said he's going to do it, but it's a tool in the toolbox. They are absolutely sending the message, the mainstream media trying to threaten the people in the great state of Texas and other states like Kristi Nomen, other states, Oklahoma are sending their national guard troops down as support. They're saying, hey, we're going to federalize in what Abbasard said. If you federalize our National Guard to work against the people of Texas, you're going to have to report to me. It's not going to be quite so easy. There going to be many other things they can pull. Right now, this border, the invasion of our country is on absolute fire. Biden understands he has a terrible situation politically, a terrible situation politically. Here, and that is exactly why he's here saying, oh, you give me this bill. I'll shut down the border. They've held our border and our sovereignty in the sovereignty of the city's hostage so they can get $60 billion to money laundering in Ukraine. They held our border hostage for the border of Ukraine and Russia over the Russian-speaking Eastern border. Okay, we're going to take a short commercial break.",subjective,immigration

Because the students of the fine arts academy in Beijing started to build the goddess of democracy. And the corrupt transnational criminal organization that is the Chinese Communist Party, by the way, backed by the world's elites, backed by the world's elites, could not take that. They tolerated what went on at Tiananmen until those young art students and those young protesters started to put up the goddess of democracy. Why couldn't they do that? They understood that that was an image as powerful as the stature of liberty. And that would incite a revolution throughout mainland China. And that's when they came up with a plan to eradicate it. They didn't care if they killed 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 people of which they probably did massacre. Is there any doubt in your mind about that? I can't hear you.

We are live at the planet Hollywood on the strip in Las Vegas, Nevada, here at the Restoring National Confidence Conference, put on by Turning Point USA. Yersley was pretty explosive, ended with some power speeches by Michael and Del Don Jr., Donald Trump Jr., and of course Charlie Kirk. But Yersley was a tremendous day of organizing. What this is, you've got, I don't know, 5, 600 of precinct committee men. You've got Republican County Chairman. You have, I think we've got 50 or 60, maybe even more Republican National Committee people here. Nobody's happy at all with how the RNC's been run. This is a organizing meeting for the next couple of days, organizing committee to make sure that we get organized for 2024. You saw right there just absolutely incredible is first time in 100 years. First time in 100 years, we're going to have impeached today a vote in the Homeland Security Council. They're impeaching, by the way, we're here live. Got a great group here of Turning Point USA that getting all jacked up, getting ready to go in for the conference. There's going to be an impeachment vote today with Mayorkas that impeachment vote. First time in 100 years, a cabinet secretary is being impeached. And here's what we've got to understand. The Mayorkas position, Homeland Security, that's absolutely central to the Senate bill that they're putting up. The Senate is putting up a bill today. The Senate is putting up a bill today or over the next couple of days you get to read the text. This is the one that Langford and the other traders have been working on. That bill is absolutely the only way can be executed is the chairman of the Secretary of Homeland Security. So before the text of the bill gets released, this Anastie bill that President Trump is adamant about should not be passed, the chief person to execute it is being impeached. His number one crime, the high crimes and misdemeanors number one is failure to execute the laws are on the books. I want you to think of the absurdity of this that after a one year process, the House Homeland Security Committee is putting forward for the first time in 100 years to impeach a cabinet secretary for breaking the law. What laws are he breaking? Essentially all the immigration laws. He's being impeached for that. The Senate, and this is how over the top and crazy it is, is putting forward an Anastie bill to essentially codify the invasion of our country. In that codification, the only control mechanism they have is the Secretary of Homeland Security who would execute all of these various changes to the Amnesty laws. It's absurd on the face of it. As President Trump said, as Speaker Johnson said, as MTG and many others have said, we have all the laws on the books we need today to shut down the border. Speaker Johnson reiterated this yesterday, that's why Speaker Johnson, we begged you not to go forward with the CR. Either shut down the border or shut down the government. We have enough laws in the books today. President Trump reiterated this yesterday. President Trump reiterated this that all you have to do is execute it right there. When President Trump was in, he closed the border to this type of mass asylum, this type of mass, illegal invasion, illegal immigration. He shut it down okay, he shut it down with the laws are on the books. We don't need any more laws now to have HR two and these other things at the House is pass to be terrific. But that's just additional bells and whistles. That's on the margin and can make it better just to reiterate. What reiterate president Trump said yesterday we have all the laws in the books we need. This Langford bill what he's been working on is a complete sellout of the country, a sellout of the nation. It is a codification of a mass invasion of the country. It would essentially leave 8 to 10 to 12 U.S. tied bensmen. Not the 30 or 40 million that have been here for decades and decades and decades. I'm talking about just since Joe Biden's reign of terror. The illegitimate regime of Joe Biden. When Joe Biden came in what he's done to the board has brought anywhere from 8 to 12 million illegal alien invaders here a massive increase to our federal spending to take care of it all. That bill is to codify. That bill is to put in place laws that would protect that. It would give work permits. I think the six million people immediately the thing is a total complete disaster and we don't need any of it. And to show that, my Yorkers will get in peach today first time in 100 years. Now I want to go back to the cold open. I understand it. Ben Burkram is over there winding the entire time. Hey, I can't say I can't. We must make sure you understand the narratives being pushed by the left. Now, here's Morning Mika. Quite important. I think 1957 Arkansas, the desegregation fight of the, I think the high schools there, present Eisenhower called in the 101st Airborne. But he also federalized the National Guard. What you're seeing in Texas. At the same time that they're coming forward and they're coming forward with this and the bill, this and just bill the exact same time they're coming forward with the and the bill. What do you have? You have the federal government going down to the state of Texas and the state of Texas saying they're trying to protect around border. Abbott, who's no fire breather, finally calls out people to help protect the border to put razor wire up, particularly down at points like Eagle Pass, Texas. What does the federal government do? They go the Supreme Court to get a ruling that they can go and cut the bob wire and let the invaders in and process more. And remember, this entire bill that you're seeing, the Langford bill is just about processing. It's not about detention and deportation. Todd Bendvich says the 2D's detention and deportation, that's not in this bill. All this is is to process more. The federal government's down to cut the razor wire because the state of Texas protecting their sovereignty and the sovereignty of their people. And what is the morning Joe come up with right away? The time that the President of the United States in an emergency about this situation down in Arkansas in the 1950s about segregation of the schools, federalize the National Guard and they say, hey, he's not threatening to do it. He hasn't said he's going to do it, but it's a tool in the toolbox. They are absolutely sending the message, the mainstream media trying to threaten the people in the great state of Texas and other states like Kristi Nomen, other states, Oklahoma are sending their national guard troops down as support. They're saying, hey, we're going to federalize in what Abbasard said. If you federalize our National Guard to work against the people of Texas, you're going to have to report to me. It's not going to be quite so easy. There going to be many other things they can pull. Right now, this border, the invasion of our country is on absolute fire. Biden understands he has a terrible situation politically, a terrible situation politically. Here, and that is exactly why he's here saying, oh, you give me this bill. I'll shut down the border. They've held our border and our sovereignty in the sovereignty of the city's hostage so they can get $60 billion to money laundering in Ukraine. They held our border hostage for the border of Ukraine and Russia over the Russian-speaking Eastern border. Okay, we're going to take a short commercial break.",subjective,immigration

We're going to have more of that later in the show. As the administrative state becomes unravel, one thing I want to get back to in a second, we're bringing Dr. Malone, the inventor of mRNA. The Chinese more than anybody, the Chinese Communist Party, because they don't give Lao Bai Jing a vote. They don't go down to Lao Bai Jing. Hey, tell me what you guys think about this. No, you stand up and get jabbed. They gave their vaccines. Of course, which miles go told us in 10,000 years they've never created a vaccine, but they could definitely create one here in six months after there was after quote unquote the Wuhan lab leak. To what Frank Gaffey said, a senior member of the Canadian military wants a like military tribunal in Canada to get to the bottom of what happened in the military games and Canadian military athletes got sick in September and October of 2019. It ain't called COVID-19 for nothing, ladies and gentlemen. All the chickens are coming home to roost on Fauci and all these liars and even worse than liars. And now they're partners. Let's say they are the partners of the transnational criminal organization that is the Chinese Communist Party. All of this, I saw a statistic today. We have spent more money on the Wuhan CCP virus than collectively to get us out of the Great Depression and the Second World War to defeat fascism in the imperial military hunta. Military hunta at a Japan more cash money. And you wonder why the United States dollars being divided you want to understand why inflation is on fire. You understand why your economic life is about to be destroyed. We're on the edge of an abyss. This abyss you wait to think and all these guys who put his in business put your pension fund money in business with the Chinese Communist Party and all these investments in particularly real estate. You watch that goes down the drain because ladies and gentlemen it's going as sure as the turning of the earth. And right now these demons and these devils that have inflicted this on the Chinese people allowed by Zhing. Now have something something wicked this way comes right out of China from the CCP and it's at their biggest cities and they can't tamp it down. The port city is bigger than I think the three biggest ports in the United States combined biggest act of industrial port in the world. These cities are massive in scale. They dwarf New York City.

These guys are in the operation of doing it live organ harvesting concentration camps across the board and yet the mainstream media is cow talon to them all the big woke corporations are cow talon to them.

Now to do this he's also going to put forward McCarthy saying he's going to put forward a CR with the border enhanced border security. His question that he's quotes I don't understand how anyone would stand in the way of blocking the border. This is how dumb as you think you are this is HR two is nothing. It's not going to do anything for two weeks. That can be implemented. We have more than enough laws some HR two is really terrific.

I ran into so how do I say this politely personal issues. The Paul Ryan ascended to the chair because you had wait for it. Personal issues they had to be addressed. Now we're here and they're going to throw up everything and now you know Don Bacon and in the in the in the in the problem solvers that's a great group. The problem solvers all the geniuses the problem solvers they're going to give you a CR that goes to January. And then you're just see the whole thing wrapped up into one. Omnibus bill done so you got the problem solvers working with the Democrats. You've got the Senate coming in with something McCarthy's now saying it comes up it whatever way whatever angle they come for. It's all to one purpose to get past the 30th and have the apparatus continue to be financed. The purpose is we're trying to deconstruct the apparatus and the first step in deconstruct it is choke it off from money. Choke it off from the Federal Reserve just continuing on and on and on and on as you have this fiscal terrorism was what it is now. Control by the lobbyist. If this didn't work for the fat cats in the lobbyists in the donor class and the bayonets do you think this would be a thing with this be a fight now. That's what the fights about because they understand the first way to get after them is to cut this massive federal spending the out of control federal spending. And that's what they refuse to do and they refuse to tell you what the reality is. And you can see in every aspect and they have the goal in there to put 24 billion dollars. In for Ukraine now somebody found your point I think was the messenger my number because it's 60 minutes of 70 billion dollars makes it 40 billion dollars. Those are all lies you got to aggregate up everything we spend on these people. 113 billion and if it was for the benefit of the Ukrainian people maybe people are getting back of it's not it's the oligarchs over there the Ukrainian people have been thrown into the channel and she had 50,000 dead Ukrainians for what. So that you go back and fight over who controls buck moot to crossroads town of buck moot. 24 billion dollars government programs were talking massive cuts in discretionary spending I think massive cuts into defense bill. Which are going to be tough but I think necessary get economic warfare up there to the top and do not commit non kinetic means we cannot continue to fight and think about the words of the 20th century. But these cuts are going to be tough they're going to be I didn't say they weren't going to be tough and their arguments on some of these on both sides. Other than the getting the weapon weaponized out which there is no argument there but it's going to be tough it's just tough to get to this point when you really start cutting programmatically taking things out and that's some fantasy we're going to get 8% 8% is on is on non discretion is on discretionary defense or not defense and is for two weeks that's a fantasy it's another false flag. .",subjective,border security

Steve Bannon is a man who's rebranded racism as nationalism, and now he is Trump's chief strategist, and he was a key player in getting the Donald into the White House. Hey, I'm Tarrick, and we're gonna walk you through how someone with such a low profile and ties to white supremacy, rose to become one of the most powerful men in the United States. After years in preps school and later graduating from Virginia Tech, Bannon enlisted in the military, where he served from the late 70s to early 80s. During this time, Bannon grew disillusioned with then-president Jimmy Carter. He felt Carter's sole focus in the Persian Gulf was aimed towards protecting U.S. oil interests from the nation's Cold War enemy, the Soviet Union. But in 1980, there was a turning point in U.S. politics. California Governor Ronald Reagan came to power after inspiring millions with the slogan, let's make America great again. Sound familiar? Bannon left the Navy in 1983 to pursue his MBA at Harvard. He would eventually find his way to one of the biggest financial firms on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs. Bannon left the banking giant to start his own firm, Bannon and Co. The upstart connected big money financiers with huge Hollywood projects. And then 9-11-Hound. Bannon threw all of his energy into producing and directing his own documentaries. But these weren't your average Netflix movies. The liberal media don't matter to me, Republican establishment don't matter to me. To hell with the establishment, because the establishment is put us in this position for twice. From 2004 to 2012, Bannon directed nine films. His inspiration, Nazi propaganda filmmaker Lenny Riefenstahl. Riefenstahl collaborated with Adolf Hitler in the 1900s to create films glorifying the Nazi party. Throughout his career, Bannon's colleagues have described his work ethic as very intense. And parts of his personal life were just as intense. Bannon was married a few times, his second life was Mary Louise Picard. She made headlines when reporters dug up a domestic violence report that she filed in 1996. Several years later, Steve and Mary Louise divorced and he married Diane Clohessie. Diane was an activist for a new political presence growing across the US, the T-Point. Bannon identified with the group's mistrust in federal government and agreed with rolling back social welfare programs. Steve and Diane also called it quits, ending their marriage in 2009. That same year, Barack Obama was sworn in as the first black president and the T-party hit the national stage. During the 2010 midterm elections, Bannon released a film Battle for America to fire up T-party supporters. I shudder to imagine what an unchecked, unlimited, Obama radicalism would be like in the next two years. He has truly awakened to sleeping giant to a point where they are determined to take back America. And Bannon's films were effective. Combined with the landmark Supreme Court case citizens united, T-party backed Republicans one big. 44 seats to be exact. In 2011, Bannon met Andrew Breitbart and the two became fast friends. Now, Breitbart.com was a conservative news organization that panned her to people who felt that Fox News was the establishment. Andrew Breitbart died in 2012. Steve Bannon took over and helped amplify anti-black, anti-Muslim, and anti-immigrant sentiment. He used Breitbart to cater to white supremacists. In that same year,",subjective,political rise

We are live at the planet Hollywood on the strip in Las Vegas, Nevada, here at the Restoring National Confidence Conference, put on by Turning Point USA. Yersley was pretty explosive, ended with some power speeches by Michael and Del Don Jr., Donald Trump Jr., and of course Charlie Kirk. But Yersley was a tremendous day of organizing. What this is, you've got, I don't know, 5, 600 of precinct committee men. You've got Republican County Chairman. You have, I think we've got 50 or 60, maybe even more Republican National Committee people here. Nobody's happy at all with how the RNC's been run. This is a organizing meeting for the next couple of days, organizing committee to make sure that we get organized for 2024. You saw right there just absolutely incredible is first time in 100 years. First time in 100 years, we're going to have impeached today a vote in the Homeland Security Council. They're impeaching, by the way, we're here live. Got a great group here of Turning Point USA that getting all jacked up, getting ready to go in for the conference. There's going to be an impeachment vote today with Mayorkas that impeachment vote. First time in 100 years, a cabinet secretary is being impeached. And here's what we've got to understand. The Mayorkas position, Homeland Security, that's absolutely central to the Senate bill that they're putting up. The Senate is putting up a bill today. The Senate is putting up a bill today or over the next couple of days you get to read the text. This is the one that Langford and the other traders have been working on. That bill is absolutely the only way can be executed is the chairman of the Secretary of Homeland Security. So before the text of the bill gets released, this Anastie bill that President Trump is adamant about should not be passed, the chief person to execute it is being impeached. His number one crime, the high crimes and misdemeanors number one is failure to execute the laws are on the books. I want you to think of the absurdity of this that after a one year process, the House Homeland Security Committee is putting forward for the first time in 100 years to impeach a cabinet secretary for breaking the law. What laws are he breaking? Essentially all the immigration laws. He's being impeached for that. The Senate, and this is how over the top and crazy it is, is putting forward an Anastie bill to essentially codify the invasion of our country. In that codification, the only control mechanism they have is the Secretary of Homeland Security who would execute all of these various changes to the Amnesty laws. It's absurd on the face of it. As President Trump said, as Speaker Johnson said, as MTG and many others have said, we have all the laws on the books we need today to shut down the border. Speaker Johnson reiterated this yesterday, that's why Speaker Johnson, we begged you not to go forward with the CR. Either shut down the border or shut down the government. We have enough laws in the books today. President Trump reiterated this yesterday. President Trump reiterated this that all you have to do is execute it right there. When President Trump was in, he closed the border to this type of mass asylum, this type of mass, illegal invasion, illegal immigration. He shut it down okay, he shut it down with the laws are on the books. We don't need any more laws now to have HR two and these other things at the House is pass to be terrific. But that's just additional bells and whistles. That's on the margin and can make it better just to reiterate. What reiterate president Trump said yesterday we have all the laws in the books we need. This Langford bill what he's been working on is a complete sellout of the country, a sellout of the nation. It is a codification of a mass invasion of the country. It would essentially leave 8 to 10 to 12 U.S. tied bensmen. Not the 30 or 40 million that have been here for decades and decades and decades. I'm talking about just since Joe Biden's reign of terror. The illegitimate regime of Joe Biden. When Joe Biden came in what he's done to the board has brought anywhere from 8 to 12 million illegal alien invaders here a massive increase to our federal spending to take care of it all. That bill is to codify. That bill is to put in place laws that would protect that. It would give work permits. I think the six million people immediately the thing is a total complete disaster and we don't need any of it. And to show that, my Yorkers will get in peach today first time in 100 years. Now I want to go back to the cold open. I understand it. Ben Burkram is over there winding the entire time. Hey, I can't say I can't. We must make sure you understand the narratives being pushed by the left. Now, here's Morning Mika. Quite important. I think 1957 Arkansas, the desegregation fight of the, I think the high schools there, present Eisenhower called in the 101st Airborne. But he also federalized the National Guard. What you're seeing in Texas. At the same time that they're coming forward and they're coming forward with this and the bill, this and just bill the exact same time they're coming forward with the and the bill. What do you have? You have the federal government going down to the state of Texas and the state of Texas saying they're trying to protect around border. Abbott, who's no fire breather, finally calls out people to help protect the border to put razor wire up, particularly down at points like Eagle Pass, Texas. What does the federal government do? They go the Supreme Court to get a ruling that they can go and cut the bob wire and let the invaders in and process more. And remember, this entire bill that you're seeing, the Langford bill is just about processing. It's not about detention and deportation. Todd Bendvich says the 2D's detention and deportation, that's not in this bill. All this is is to process more. The federal government's down to cut the razor wire because the state of Texas protecting their sovereignty and the sovereignty of their people. And what is the morning Joe come up with right away? The time that the President of the United States in an emergency about this situation down in Arkansas in the 1950s about segregation of the schools, federalize the National Guard and they say, hey, he's not threatening to do it. He hasn't said he's going to do it, but it's a tool in the toolbox. They are absolutely sending the message, the mainstream media trying to threaten the people in the great state of Texas and other states like Kristi Nomen, other states, Oklahoma are sending their national guard troops down as support. They're saying, hey, we're going to federalize in what Abbasard said. If you federalize our National Guard to work against the people of Texas, you're going to have to report to me. It's not going to be quite so easy. There going to be many other things they can pull. Right now, this border, the invasion of our country is on absolute fire. Biden understands he has a terrible situation politically, a terrible situation politically. Here, and that is exactly why he's here saying, oh, you give me this bill. I'll shut down the border. They've held our border and our sovereignty in the sovereignty of the city's hostage so they can get $60 billion to money laundering in Ukraine. They held our border hostage for the border of Ukraine and Russia over the Russian-speaking Eastern border. Okay, we're going to take a short commercial break.",subjective,immigration

Oh you don't support border security did what he talked about maggot in this audience are the people on for the last three years longer than that. Back in 2000 what third 2014 when we stopped the madness and through air canter out remember that McCarthy when you had a then later when you had a moment to be speaker the first time but. I ran into so how do I say this politely personal issues. The Paul Ryan ascended to the chair because you had wait for it. Personal issues they had to be addressed. Now we're here and they're going to throw up everything and now you know Don Bacon and in the in the in the in the problem solvers that's a great group. The problem solvers all the geniuses the problem solvers they're going to give you a CR that goes to January. And then you're just see the whole thing wrapped up into one. Omnibus bill done so you got the problem solvers working with the Democrats. You've got the Senate coming in with something McCarthy's now saying it comes up it whatever way whatever angle they come for. It's all to one purpose to get past the 30th and have the apparatus continue to be financed. The purpose is we're trying to deconstruct the apparatus and the first step in deconstruct it is choke it off from money. Choke it off from the Federal Reserve just continuing on and on and on and on as you have this fiscal terrorism was what it is now. Control by the lobbyist. If this didn't work for the fat cats in the lobbyists in the donor class and the bayonets do you think this would be a thing with this be a fight now. That's what the fights about because they understand the first way to get after them is to cut this massive federal spending the out of control federal spending. And that's what they refuse to do and they refuse to tell you what the reality is. And you can see in every aspect and they have the goal in there to put 24 billion dollars. In for Ukraine now somebody found your point I think was the messenger my number because it's 60 minutes of 70 billion dollars makes it 40 billion dollars. Those are all lies you got to aggregate up everything we spend on these people. 113 billion and if it was for the benefit of the Ukrainian people maybe people are getting back of it's not it's the oligarchs over there the Ukrainian people have been thrown into the channel and she had 50,000 dead Ukrainians for what. So that you go back and fight over who controls buck moot to crossroads town of buck moot. 24 billion dollars government programs were talking massive cuts in discretionary spending I think massive cuts into defense bill. Which are going to be tough but I think necessary get economic warfare up there to the top and do not commit non kinetic means we cannot continue to fight and think about the words of the 20th century. But these cuts are going to be tough they're going to be I didn't say they weren't going to be tough and their arguments on some of these on both sides. Other than the getting the weapon weaponized out which there is no argument there but it's going to be tough it's just tough to get to this point when you really start cutting programmatically taking things out and that's some fantasy we're going to get 8% 8% is on is on non discretion is on discretionary defense or not defense and is for two weeks that's a fantasy it's another false flag. .",subjective,border security

Bannon. What is to it, brother? Yeah, Steve, so we're down here in Eagle Pass, and you guys can see behind me. We got a national guard here. You can actually see him, gentlemen. He's trying to break into our country right here. So there's an illegal immigrant right there that's probably gonna get let through this razor wire right here by Border Patrol. So now that I'm out here and I got my phone out, chances are they're probably not gonna help that young man through. But when I was sitting here waiting for you to come on your show, a young lady with an infant toddler, probably about one year old, and another lady were just escorted through that razor wire by Border Patrol. So when we got here this morning, we arrived and they changed the media area. Before a media could drive all the way up, right up the wall here, now they have it blocked. So our trucks can't get even, like we're, a couple of football fields away. We have to bark, our way it goes way out there. Originally they weren't gonna let us over here. When we started flying up our drone, they sent a state trooper over to intimidate us in harass us. They had a helicopter going up and there was a helicopter in the air, so I had to take my drone down, which all they wanted was my drone to not be filming shipping containers. Because they were letting, they were helping all of the illegal immigrants break over. I mean, you can see the ladder right there. The ladder is right there up against the shipping container. So why do you have a ladder there? To help the migrants come over. So they'll dump the ladder on the other side, they'll let them climb up and then they'll help them down into America. I mean, our country's being invaded. There was at least probably 300 or 400 migrants lined up along this river bank this morning right when we got here. I'll try and to break in. And as soon as they saw my drone coming up, we would move them to this side. And then when my drone was down here, they would have them go into the other side. And then moving them back and forth. I just want to make clear to the audience, because that drone footage is so brilliant that they are, and these are American authorities are absolutely opposed to you putting, they'll come up with any excuse in the world. Oh, we're putting, you know, FB 111 up, we got helicopters going up. They come up with every excuse and different levels, federal and even state to try to make sure that your drone can't get up there and get the footage that America needs to see. Am I correct in that? 100% and I got that part on film too. I'll be posting it later. Tell me, you've been at this for a while. Is this getting worse? Or is it any, even with the wire going up and some of the, you know, Abbot and Abbot's gonna have, I think Trump come down in a week or so, is in your mind getting stabilized, getting better or is it in invasion getting worse? The invasion's getting exponentially worse. They are getting exponentially better at moving these migrants through our country. And processing, I mean, this thing is like a well-oiled machine. They register with it, they check in with the app, so the CBP app tells Border Patrol exactly where they're gonna be. So as soon as they arrive on USA, so I guess they claim asylum and then Border Patrol picks them up, deliver them to be high, which is like their first checkpoint over there where you can see the buses. I mean, there's probably 50 migrants over there as we speak, and ready to get loaded onto that bus. And then that bus will take them about a mile and a half up the road to the first processing facility. And what goes on at that facility, it's above my pay grade, it's an NGO. And then they process them and ship them wherever they wanna go in the country. Or they have their friends pick them up, they had, you know, looked like a, I don't know, a chauffeur, a guy out there and looked like what looked like a Benz yesterday picking up three migrants. I mean, some of these migrants are wearing Louis Vuitton, some are wearing Gucci. It's hard to say that these people are suffering when they're coming over here and luxury clothes. I can't even afford to buy those clothes. So it's actually a last thing, is our brave Border Patrol, it sounds like familiar reporting has been turned into a concierge service. Absolutely. Their only job down here is to play Uber for the migrants. I would say, it seems like they have no desire. I think while the patrol is coming up, they're just burnt out. Ryan, how do people get to your footage? Where do they go on social media or your site to follow your reporting down there? You can follow me on rumble and getter at Ryan Mata. And you can also follow me on Twitter at Ryan Mata Media. Ryan, great job. You'd be safe then. We're gonna put up on our platforms, Grace Chung and Captain Benz are gonna push it out right now. Fantastic. Magnificent. Your drone is incredible. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. God bless. Thanks, thanks, Ryan. Okay, let's go. If Grace and Mokin get that up everywhere, that drone footage is absolutely incredible. This is what's happening in your country. I mean, looking right there in Eagle Pass, Texas.

Dozens of trucks and other vehicles could have been seen blocking the downtown area of Ottawa as protesters rallied against vaccine mandates masks and lockdowns. That seems like an interesting way to spend your weekend. The demonstrations were initially aimed at pushback against vaccine mandates for truck drivers crossing the U.S. Canada border. But the movement escalated into an expression of disapproval with the Canadian government's COVID-19 policies. Officials say several investigations are underway into reports of severe vandalism and criminal behavior, including the desecration of national monuments. Meanwhile, Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said some protesters harassed a soup kitchen demanding free meals because they're refusal to wear masks meant they were not to order in restaurants. Not soup kitchen tweeted COVID protesters were given meals to defuse the conflict and that this weekend's events have caused significant strain on our operations at an already difficult time. So these anti-vaxxers actually took food from the mouths of the homeless. Hungry, yeah. Because they were they're so put upon. Yeah. I'm just curious again, where were these protests when people were required to take, get five vaccines to start school? Where were these protests when people were required to give their children five vaccines? They were in the doctor's office getting vaccines. They were in the doctor's office getting vaccinated. They were making fun of left wingers on the West Coast for being loopy anti-vaxxers. Now they have met the enemy and the enemy, their enemy is themselves because they've become what they hated.

When I talk to my conservative friends right here, they always tell me the problem is high taxes, that they are wrong. Of course, high taxes are extremely high here in the United States. I give you that. You're right in that. But that's not the real problem. The real problem is not the high taxes themselves, but the fact that they are not even really funding the government. But even those high taxes, higher than a lot of places in the world, but even those taxes are really funding the government. So who's finance in the government? Government is finance by Treasury bonds. And who buys the Treasury bonds? Mostly the Fed. And how does the Fed buy them? By printing money. But what back in does the Fed have? For that money being printed? The Treasury bonds themselves. So basically, you finance the government by printing money out of the air. Someone could ask, someone could ask, well, so if the government can print a limited amount of money out of the air, why did they collect taxes? I mean, if you will make sense, right, if they can print a limited amount of money, why would they need taxes? The answer is simple, but it's better shocking. The real problem is that you pay high taxes only to uphold the illusion that you are funding the government, which you are not. It's something that is true. The government is funded by money printing, paid for back with paper, a bubble that will inevitably burst. The situation is even worse than it seems, because it most Americans and the rest of the world were to become aware of this far. Confidence in your currency will be lost. The dollar will fall and the Western civilization will. If the next president of the United States doesn't make the necessary policies and structural changes, sooner or later that bubble will burst. There's a still time you don't have to make the same mistakes we did in the 60s and the 70s. You can still jump before the water boils. Winning the election isn't enough to solve these problems. They will not simply go away as a consequence of an electoral result. It will take a total of the engineering of the government up to bottom. It will entail making difficult decisions like the ones we made in Osabata since 2019 and they are already paying off. It will be hard. The system will push back, but you have the right to determine your own fate. The decision for the direction of our nation was ours and it continues to be ours.

When I talk to my conservative friends right here, they always tell me the problem is high taxes, that they are wrong. Of course, high taxes are extremely high here in the United States. I give you that. You're right in that. But that's not the real problem. The real problem is not the high taxes themselves, but the fact that they are not even really funding the government. But even those high taxes, higher than a lot of places in the world, but even those taxes are really funding the government. So who's finance in the government? Government is finance by Treasury bonds. And who buys the Treasury bonds? Mostly the Fed. And how does the Fed buy them? By printing money. But what back in does the Fed have? For that money being printed? The Treasury bonds themselves. So basically, you finance the government by printing money out of the air. Someone could ask, someone could ask, well, so if the government can print a limited amount of money out of the air, why did they collect taxes? I mean, if you will make sense, right, if they can print a limited amount of money, why would they need taxes? The answer is simple, but it's better shocking. The real problem is that you pay high taxes only to uphold the illusion that you are funding the government, which you are not. It's something that is true. The government is funded by money printing, paid for back with paper, a bubble that will inevitably burst. The situation is even worse than it seems, because it most Americans and the rest of the world were to become aware of this far. Confidence in your currency will be lost. The dollar will fall and the Western civilization will. If the next president of the United States doesn't make the necessary policies and structural changes, sooner or later that bubble will burst. There's a still time you don't have to make the same mistakes we did in the 60s and the 70s. You can still jump before the water boils. Winning the election isn't enough to solve these problems. They will not simply go away as a consequence of an electoral result. It will take a total of the engineering of the government up to bottom.

The real problem is that you pay high taxes only to uphold the illusion that you are funding the government, which you are not. It's something that is true. The government is funded by money printing, paid for back with paper, a bubble that will inevitably burst. The situation is even worse than it seems, because it most Americans and the rest of the world were to become aware of this far. Confidence in your currency will be lost. The dollar will fall and the Western civilization will. If the next president of the United States doesn't make the necessary policies and structural changes, sooner or later that bubble will burst. There's a still time you don't have to make the same mistakes we did in the 60s and the 70s. You can still jump before the water boils. Winning the election isn't enough to solve these problems. They will not simply go away as a consequence of an electoral result. It will take a total of the engineering of the government up to bottom. It will entail making difficult decisions like the ones we made in Osabata since 2019 and they are already paying off. It will be hard.

When I talk to my conservative friends right here, they always tell me the problem is high taxes, that they are wrong. Of course, high taxes are extremely high here in the United States. I give you that. You're right in that. But that's not the real problem. The real problem is not the high taxes themselves, but the fact that they are not even really funding the government. But even those high taxes, higher than a lot of places in the world, but even those taxes are really funding the government. So who's finance in the government? Government is finance by Treasury bonds. And who buys the Treasury bonds? Mostly the Fed. And how does the Fed buy them? By printing money. But what back in does the Fed have? For that money being printed? The Treasury bonds themselves. So basically, you finance the government by printing money out of the air. Someone could ask, someone could ask, well, so if the government can print a limited amount of money out of the air, why did they collect taxes? I mean, if you will make sense, right, if they can print a limited amount of money, why would they need taxes? The answer is simple, but it's better shocking. The real problem is that you pay high taxes only to uphold the illusion that you are funding the government, which you are not. It's something that is true. The government is funded by money printing, paid for back with paper, a bubble that will inevitably burst. The situation is even worse than it seems, because it most Americans and the rest of the world were to become aware of this far. Confidence in your currency will be lost. The dollar will fall and the Western civilization will. If the next president of the United States doesn't make the necessary policies and structural changes, sooner or later that bubble will burst. There's a still time you don't have to make the same mistakes we did in the 60s and the 70s. You can still jump before the water boils. Winning the election isn't enough to solve these problems. They will not simply go away as a consequence of an electoral result. It will take a total of the engineering of the government up to bottom. It will entail making difficult decisions like the ones we made in Osabata since 2019 and they are already paying off. It will be hard. The system will push back, but you have the right to determine your own fate. The decision for the direction of our nation was ours and it continues to be ours.

Well, it's come to my attention that some of my viewers were a little bit upset with a video that I posted this morning. They didn't like the language. And I just want to say to all those who had a problem with it, I am so fucking sorry that you are so sensitive. Look, I'm not trying to gas like you. You really are sensitive. Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can't do a damn thing to me. Ova Chaz, I thought you were better than that. Please, remove the pedestal that you have placed under my feet. I am not perfect. I cuss like a sailor. I was raised in the street. I spend a lot of my time crafting my stories for Chick-Tok. And I have to be very careful what I say on here. You'd be surprised at what words you are not allowed to say. And while I have to say that I was assayed or I was molested as a child, whenever I'm telling those stories, by the way, would you rather hear those stories than the word fuck? I mean, like, is the word fuck so offensive after I just told you that I got molested when I was 12 by a 40-year-old man? Really? I'm not putting your comments up here. I'm not going to send people to your page to hate on you. I'm not going to do any of that. I think you're coming from a place of sincerity in which somehow you actually do think that you can tell me what to say or how to say it. And you can express your discontent for it. If you're not happy with what I say, you can scroll on. You don't have to follow me. The fact that you do follow me is nice. I appreciate it. But you don't have to. My goal here is to be as real and person as I am here on TikTok. I'm honest. I tell you the truth and it's not going to be coming to you in a candy-coded fashion. I'm going to cuss. It's going to happen from time to time. You must not watch Showtime or HBO or Netflix. Look, I get three minutes to tell a story here and I have to edit it down to meet the guidelines. And you cannot tell a whole story in just three minutes. There's always more to every story. Trust me. The main thing for me is that I am not inhibited. Not here, not anywhere. My freedom of speech is important to me and I will express myself as I see fit when I see fit. I have well over a half a million followers on here and I haven't even been here a year yet. So I must be doing something right. My best advice for any TikTok creator right now is just be yourself. Don't put up with any bullshit.

I wanted to hop on here really quickly in my authentic form because I wanted to express what was in my mind about me deactivating my Facebook. This video is gonna be in the role. I'm a little emotional. I don't know good ones bad ones whatever but I see now why people post videos and then crying on the internet. Yeah. So I've had the same Facebook page since 2007. I've had the same Facebook page for 16 years. I've never like started a new page. I've never gotten hacked or anything like that. And so many people who are not familiar with TikTok always talk shit about TikTok right? They're like I don't have a TikTok and whatever people have their misconception about what it is. But what they don't realize is TikTok is more of who you are and not what TikTok is. And with Facebook I feel like it's a little different. And I've been putting this all finn has been weighing heavy all me like for the last few months and the reason why I didn't want to deactivate it and create a new page yet is because my mother passed away a couple years ago and I'm the legacy holder or I'm the legacy person on her account which means I can access her account and make decisions post on her page delete friends add friends and everything like that. I didn't want to let that last connection go but it's time. I don't know about you guys but I went through a phase where most people do like where I was adding every single friend request or adding every single suggestion if I knew if I had enough mutual friends and there's like almost 5,000 people in my Facebook and I couldn't tell you how many of them I actually know. I have some important photos on there, some good content you know things like that like from my blog, from my rental, some really really important memories that I hold dear to my heart so I know that it's going to be a process and with everything already have going on I know this is going to take me maybe a week or two to actually save the things I want from my Facebook and put it to the side. But what I finally understand and what I need to understand is that like waking up and getting on social media that is putting a lot of bad things or not bad things but like a lot of emotionally draining or emotionally pulling things or triggering things like in your face and the morning or anytime of day to get a distraction you know we scroll in there for a boosa serotonin or whatever and we get a notification and we're like oh you know that just puts us in a better mood hormonally right instantly for just a moment of instant gratification but there are so many things that are like trash on my Facebook trashed me that put me in a bad headspace. Like a lot of times I would just see something and you know just keep scrolling whatever not interact with it you know because it's freedom of speech right anybody can post whatever they want on their page I'm not saying I'm better than anybody else I'm not saying that I'm not saying I'm judging anyone else like who am I to judge I have some things on my Facebook over the last 16 years that I'm sure I would not think about posting today. Like the other day there was some random guy that posted corn right I instantly unfriended unfollowed them. There was someone else that posted like the super massagingistic comment on someone's page there's someone that posted this gorgeous heavy set white girl with like piercings and pink hair and it was a new profile picture that she made for herself and somebody shared her profile picture saying why are we low in our standards so much there are people that are my real friends in my and our friends in my real life that are friends with people on social media that like just judge judge judge or talk so mean like just talk so mean about people and and it's just it's overwhelming sometimes the video that just took me out that I saw was like someone posted a video of like six guys jumping someone and jail and stabbing him to death while someone recorded and he posted it and was like damn I know that Facebook and other social media can be used like you to keep us in a loop for the news right with these new generations everyone like having you know us having that worldwide like touch where we can see what's going on all the world when it's not really covered in the news I get that and I also understand that it helps to keep connections with people that are far away that you won't see for years. My TikTok feed expresses or falls in line with who I am as a person so yes I will be deactivating my Facebook and I will be creating a new Facebook page I'm not worried about the friend count anymore I'm 33 who cares about that I'll add the people that I actually have connections with that I actually know because all those examples of those posts that I saw it was from people that I'd have no idea who they are and we're friends so anyway it's going to be like an emotional process I won't be able to again access my mom's account anymore I'll still be able to see her account you know I'm not going to deactivate her Facebook or anything like that because I could I'm not going to deactivate her Facebook back and always go back and scroll through her pictures and things like that but as far as for me I'm going to take the next couple of days or week or whatever and pull all the members that I want to keep and then I'll create a new Facebook page with everything I have going on in my life mentally and physically and everything like that and everything that you may have going on in yours it may be time for you to reflect and remove some things that you know would be triggering for that anyways happy Sunday thanks for coming to my TED Talk and I don't know have a good day",subjective,social media

TikTok has helped illuminate for so many people just how corrupt our government is and that's exactly why they don't want it. TikTok is a threat to fascism in the United States. This is also Mark Zuckerberg's attempt to monopolize and to have everyone who use MADA for social media and that's kind of crazy because Gen Z is not going to use Facebook. The government is afraid of TikTok because it does not have control over it. The government wants us to be watching things like box news or looking at ads on Facebook. They do not want us to be on TikTok where we can share ideas and communicate with each other. TikTok has been an invaluable tool for me as a neurodivergent person that has struggled making friends. It is very easy to make friends on TikTok as a neurodivergent because it unites us and creates community for us in ways that are hard to do in the real world.

In today's issue of pink news, it's featured that a Canadian family moved to Russia to escape wokeness and LGBTQ people, and it didn't go well. Weird. The YouTuber patriarch of the right-wing Canadian family, Aaron Feonstra, decided that he'd had enough of gay people existing in his country. So he decided to take his family to Russia instead. He said that they did not feel safe for their children in Canada and their children's future anymore. He's an avowedly Christian dad of eight. But there were a few little details that the Feonstras forgot to work out before they moved to Russia to get away from gay people, such as learning Russian, because once they got there, and Neesa Feonstra was faced with trying to choose which bathroom to use and didn't speak Russian. And of course in Russia, you have to use the bathroom for the sex that you were assigned to at birth. And she said, I needed to use the washroom, and on the doors it said male and female, but I didn't know which was which. In America, that wouldn't be a problem. It's a free-for-all in the bathrooms. And then there was the fact that they failed to find out whether or not their credit cards would work in Russia, which they don't. And then the fact that they plunked a large sum of cash into a Russian bank account that was subsequently seized by the Russian government because of the possibility of money laundering. This caused Neesa to throw a fairly large temper tantrum on their YouTube, criticizing the Russian government pretty heavily. And who would have thought that a government that does not allow people to express themselves in their sexual orientation or their sexual identification would actually not allow you to criticize the government openly? So this caused their Russian handlers to sort of wrap them on the knuckles according to this article. And they pulled back their criticism of the government and said, no, we're not frustrated with the government. We're just frustrated with ourselves here in this country. So now all 10 of the family members are living in a two-room apartment because all of their money was frozen in a bank account by the Russian government. They can't use their visa or their master card or any of that. And they don't have the funds to buy the farm that they had hoped to buy. And they don't speak Russian. And so weird that a country that they thought they were escaping to for freedom from the LGBTQ community is now really causing them to live in a prison of their own making.",subjective,family str

That's the next topic we're going to cover. Tennessee right now is in a really shit position, especially considering everything that's going on. So what is freedom of speech? You look it up, it's going to say a principal that sports the freedom of an individual or community to articulate their opinions, ideas without the fear of retaliation, censorship or legal sanctioned. Freedom of expression interchangeably is recognized as a human right by the UN. And a freedom of expression includes any activity of seeking, receiving, imparting information ideas regardless of the media amused. What that means is when Senado Conner, way back in the day, tore a picture of the Pope. That's freedom of speech. When somebody is out in corner saying, you know, everybody is going to hell holding a sign. That's freedom of speech. It's a very big deal here in the United States. But it appears lately that that is no longer an option. Freedom of speech is disappearing. Now to start with whether you want to look at the overall situation happening in Tennessee, they're ousting three members due to them standing with their constituents over gun violence. Right now, OU, in Norman has a shooting that's happening. Haven't been able to see what's going on on the flip side of it. But clearly guns are an issue. I am a gun owner. I do carry a pistol with me. That doesn't mean there's not an issue. The situation we're running into is which right takes precedence, the right of human life, the right to talk about it, or the right to own. The answer to that is all of them take precedence. But for people to be ousted from their position in the legislature for standing with their constituents is fucking crazy. Okay, freedom of speech is everything to this country. And that includes fucking drag queens. Whether or not you like them is irrelevant. Right. The definition itself is an individual or community that wants to articulate an opinion.

Well, just personally, I was really extremely disappointed. And it's I guess a bit strange to be continually disappointed by Kanye West, but I didn't hear about it since until Sunday morning when the brother of George Floyd Clownis gave me a call and said, he was I ring. He was extremely hurt by the statements that Kanye West made. I had to go look up the interview and see that he was now blame in a drug overdose and a theory that was well debunked in court as you all pointed out, something that is clearly not the reason that George Floyd died. He died as a a bearish chauvin's knee and the other officers compressing his body in a prone position. And now he's promulgating those statements are new in a way that is it almost seemed designed to cause the family distress. And so they reached out to me specifically his brother and asked that we again investigate whether or not we can restrain him from making such statements and hold him accountable for the misinformation that he's putting out there. How serious are they about doing something against Kanye West? I know that Clownis Floyd, for example, was bothered that I said we were considering lawsuit. He is absolutely committed to bringing lawsuit and I've heard from other members of the family who are represented by various parties saying that they are absolutely 100% moving forward with litigation against Kanye West and anyone else who would defend George Floyd in his reputation. Part of what makes this so upsetting for the family is that after George was murdered Kanye West was one of many people celebrities who reached out and I believe he even made a donation to pay for George's daughter's college tuition. So I know there was some appreciation that was expressed by the family back then and then now to hear him saying things like this. You know that that actually did come up in the conversation I had with Clownis. A part of the conversation was one of the Cooper Jones, a mod Arbiter's mother and those families that Floyd family and the Arbiter family are friends and when this kind of injury takes place when someone undermines their movement they support each other. The two of them called me together and they said that they saw Kanye West as a friend and that's why this was personal for them that it wasn't just some random person who isn't had an action family who didn't know them so far as supportive and made this thing but this was someone who was awfully supportive in the past which almost legitimizes his extreme views and you know they've asked that with that in mind that we pursue litigation against Kanye.",subjective,george floyd

Well, it's come to my attention that some of my viewers were a little bit upset with a video that I posted this morning. They didn't like the language. And I just want to say to all those who had a problem with it, I am so fucking sorry that you are so sensitive. Look, I'm not trying to gas like you. You really are sensitive. Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can't do a damn thing to me. Ova Chaz, I thought you were better than that. Please, remove the pedestal that you have placed under my feet. I am not perfect. I cuss like a sailor. I was raised in the street. I spend a lot of my time crafting my stories for Chick-Tok. And I have to be very careful what I say on here. You'd be surprised at what words you are not allowed to say. And while I have to say that I was assayed or I was molested as a child, whenever I'm telling those stories, by the way, would you rather hear those stories than the word fuck? I mean, like, is the word fuck so offensive after I just told you that I got molested when I was 12 by a 40-year-old man? Really? I'm not putting your comments up here. I'm not going to send people to your page to hate on you. I'm not going to do any of that. I think you're coming from a place of sincerity in which somehow you actually do think that you can tell me what to say or how to say it. And you can express your discontent for it. If you're not happy with what I say, you can scroll on. You don't have to follow me. The fact that you do follow me is nice. I appreciate it. But you don't have to. My goal here is to be as real and person as I am here on TikTok. I'm honest. I tell you the truth and it's not going to be coming to you in a candy-coded fashion. I'm going to cuss. It's going to happen from time to time. You must not watch Showtime or HBO or Netflix. Look, I get three minutes to tell a story here and I have to edit it down to meet the guidelines. And you cannot tell a whole story in just three minutes. There's always more to every story. Trust me. The main thing for me is that I am not inhibited. Not here, not anywhere. My freedom of speech is important to me and I will express myself as I see fit when I see fit. I have well over a half a million followers on here and I haven't even been here a year yet. So I must be doing something right. My best advice for any TikTok creator right now is just be yourself. Don't put up with any bullshit. Just handle other people on here as you would handle people in real life. Be authentic. Everybody likes authenticity.",subjective,social media

I wanted to hop on here really quickly in my authentic form because I wanted to express what was in my mind about me deactivating my Facebook. This video is gonna be in the role. I'm a little emotional. I don't know good ones bad ones whatever but I see now why people post videos and then crying on the internet. Yeah. So I've had the same Facebook page since 2007. I've had the same Facebook page for 16 years. I've never like started a new page. I've never gotten hacked or anything like that. And so many people who are not familiar with TikTok always talk shit about TikTok right? They're like I don't have a TikTok and whatever people have their misconception about what it is. But what they don't realize is TikTok is more of who you are and not what TikTok is. And with Facebook I feel like it's a little different. And I've been putting this all finn has been weighing heavy all me like for the last few months and the reason why I didn't want to deactivate it and create a new page yet is because my mother passed away a couple years ago and I'm the legacy holder or I'm the legacy person on her account which means I can access her account and make decisions post on her page delete friends add friends and everything like that. I didn't want to let that last connection go but it's time. I don't know about you guys but I went through a phase where most people do like where I was adding every single friend request or adding every single suggestion if I knew if I had enough mutual friends and there's like almost 5,000 people in my Facebook and I couldn't tell you how many of them I actually know. I have some important photos on there, some good content you know things like that like from my blog, from my rental, some really really important memories that I hold dear to my heart so I know that it's going to be a process and with everything already have going on I know this is going to take me maybe a week or two to actually save the things I want from my Facebook and put it to the side. But what I finally understand and what I need to understand is that like waking up and getting on social media that is putting a lot of bad things or not bad things but like a lot of emotionally draining or emotionally pulling things or triggering things like in your face and the morning or anytime of day to get a distraction you know we scroll in there for a boosa serotonin or whatever and we get a notification and we're like oh you know that just puts us in a better mood hormonally right instantly for just a moment of instant gratification but there are so many things that are like trash on my Facebook trashed me that put me in a bad headspace. Like a lot of times I would just see something and you know just keep scrolling whatever not interact with it you know because it's freedom of speech right anybody can post whatever they want on their page I'm not saying I'm better than anybody else I'm not saying that I'm not saying I'm judging anyone else like who am I to judge I have some things on my Facebook over the last 16 years that I'm sure I would not think about posting today. Like the other day there was some random guy that posted corn right I instantly unfriended unfollowed them. There was someone else that posted like the super massagingistic comment on someone's page there's someone that posted this gorgeous heavy set white girl with like piercings and pink hair and it was a new profile picture that she made for herself and somebody shared her profile picture saying why are we low in our standards so much there are people that are my real friends in my and our friends in my real life that are friends with people on social media that like just judge judge judge or talk so mean like just talk so mean about people and and it's just it's overwhelming sometimes the video that just took me out that I saw was like someone posted a video of like six guys jumping someone and jail and stabbing him to death while someone recorded and he posted it and was like damn I know that Facebook and other social media can be used like you to keep us in a loop for the news right with these new generations everyone like having you know us having that worldwide like touch where we can see what's going on all the world when it's not really covered in the news I get that and I also understand that it helps to keep connections with people that are far away that you won't see for years. My TikTok feed expresses or falls in line with who I am as a person so yes I will be deactivating my Facebook and I will be creating a new Facebook page I'm not worried about the friend count anymore I'm 33 who cares about that I'll add the people that I actually have connections with that I actually know because all those examples of those posts that I saw it was from people that I'd have no idea who they are and we're friends so anyway it's going to be like an emotional process I won't be able to again access my mom's account anymore I'll still be able to see her account you know I'm not going to deactivate her Facebook or anything like that because I could I'm not going to deactivate her Facebook back and always go back and scroll through her pictures and things like that but as far as for me I'm going to take the next couple of days or week or whatever and pull all the members that I want to keep and then I'll create a new Facebook page with everything I have going on in my life mentally and physically and everything like that and everything that you may have going on in yours it may be time for you to reflect and remove some things that you know would be triggering for that anyways happy Sunday thanks for coming to my TED Talk and I don't know have a good day",subjective,social media

They do not want the American people to be able to talk with each other, to share ideas, to livestream protests. TikTok has helped illuminate for so many people just how corrupt our government is and that's exactly why they don't want it. TikTok is a threat to fascism in the United States. This is also Mark Zuckerberg's attempt to monopolize and to have everyone who use MADA for social media and that's kind of crazy because Gen Z is not going to use Facebook. The government is afraid of TikTok because it does not have control over it. The government wants us to be watching things like box news or looking at ads on Facebook. They do not want us to be on TikTok where we can share ideas and communicate with each other. TikTok has been an invaluable tool for me as a neurodivergent person that has struggled making friends. It is very easy to make friends on TikTok as a neurodivergent because it unites us and creates community for us in ways that are hard to do in the real world. TikTok also makes it a lot easier for people to have businesses online and they also do not want to lose the working class and do not want to lose workers for capitalism.",subjective,freedom speech

In today's issue of pink news, it's featured that a Canadian family moved to Russia to escape wokeness and LGBTQ people, and it didn't go well. Weird. The YouTuber patriarch of the right-wing Canadian family, Aaron Feonstra, decided that he'd had enough of gay people existing in his country. So he decided to take his family to Russia instead. He said that they did not feel safe for their children in Canada and their children's future anymore. He's an avowedly Christian dad of eight. But there were a few little details that the Feonstras forgot to work out before they moved to Russia to get away from gay people, such as learning Russian, because once they got there, and Neesa Feonstra was faced with trying to choose which bathroom to use and didn't speak Russian. And of course in Russia, you have to use the bathroom for the sex that you were assigned to at birth. And she said, I needed to use the washroom, and on the doors it said male and female, but I didn't know which was which. In America, that wouldn't be a problem. It's a free-for-all in the bathrooms. And then there was the fact that they failed to find out whether or not their credit cards would work in Russia, which they don't. And then the fact that they plunked a large sum of cash into a Russian bank account that was subsequently seized by the Russian government because of the possibility of money laundering. This caused Neesa to throw a fairly large temper tantrum on their YouTube, criticizing the Russian government pretty heavily. And who would have thought that a government that does not allow people to express themselves in their sexual orientation or their sexual identification would actually not allow you to criticize the government openly? So this caused their Russian handlers to sort of wrap them on the knuckles according to this article. And they pulled back their criticism of the government and said, no, we're not frustrated with the government. We're just frustrated with ourselves here in this country. So now all 10 of the family members are living in a two-room apartment because all of their money was frozen in a bank account by the Russian government. They can't use their visa or their master card or any of that. And they don't have the funds to buy the farm that they had hoped to buy. And they don't speak Russian. And so weird that a country that they thought they were escaping to for freedom from the LGBTQ community is now really causing them to live in a prison of their own making.",subjective,family mis

That's the next topic we're going to cover. Tennessee right now is in a really shit position, especially considering everything that's going on. So what is freedom of speech? You look it up, it's going to say a principal that sports the freedom of an individual or community to articulate their opinions, ideas without the fear of retaliation, censorship or legal sanctioned. Freedom of expression interchangeably is recognized as a human right by the UN. And a freedom of expression includes any activity of seeking, receiving, imparting information ideas regardless of the media amused. What that means is when Senado Conner, way back in the day, tore a picture of the Pope. That's freedom of speech. When somebody is out in corner saying, you know, everybody is going to hell holding a sign. That's freedom of speech. It's a very big deal here in the United States. But it appears lately that that is no longer an option. Freedom of speech is disappearing. Now to start with whether you want to look at the overall situation happening in Tennessee, they're ousting three members due to them standing with their constituents over gun violence. Right now, OU, in Norman has a shooting that's happening. Haven't been able to see what's going on on the flip side of it. But clearly guns are an issue. I am a gun owner. I do carry a pistol with me. That doesn't mean there's not an issue. The situation we're running into is which right takes precedence, the right of human life, the right to talk about it, or the right to own. The answer to that is all of them take precedence. But for people to be ousted from their position in the legislature for standing with their constituents is fucking crazy. Okay, freedom of speech is everything to this country. And that includes fucking drag queens. Whether or not you like them is irrelevant. Right. The definition itself is an individual or community that wants to articulate an opinion. For anyone to block a community or an individual from expressing themselves, however they deem fit is insane. And it goes against basic human rights.",subjective,freedom

Well, just personally, I was really extremely disappointed. And it's I guess a bit strange to be continually disappointed by Kanye West, but I didn't hear about it since until Sunday morning when the brother of George Floyd Clownis gave me a call and said, he was I ring. He was extremely hurt by the statements that Kanye West made. I had to go look up the interview and see that he was now blame in a drug overdose and a theory that was well debunked in court as you all pointed out, something that is clearly not the reason that George Floyd died. He died as a a bearish chauvin's knee and the other officers compressing his body in a prone position. And now he's promulgating those statements are new in a way that is it almost seemed designed to cause the family distress. And so they reached out to me specifically his brother and asked that we again investigate whether or not we can restrain him from making such statements and hold him accountable for the misinformation that he's putting out there. How serious are they about doing something against Kanye West? I know that Clownis Floyd, for example, was bothered that I said we were considering lawsuit. He is absolutely committed to bringing lawsuit and I've heard from other members of the family who are represented by various parties saying that they are absolutely 100% moving forward with litigation against Kanye West and anyone else who would defend George Floyd in his reputation. Part of what makes this so upsetting for the family is that after George was murdered Kanye West was one of many people celebrities who reached out and I believe he even made a donation to pay for George's daughter's college tuition. So I know there was some appreciation that was expressed by the family back then and then now to hear him saying things like this. You know that that actually did come up in the conversation I had with Clownis. A part of the conversation was one of the Cooper Jones, a mod Arbiter's mother and those families that Floyd family and the Arbiter family are friends and when this kind of injury takes place when someone undermines their movement they support each other. The two of them called me together and they said that they saw Kanye West as a friend and that's why this was personal for them that it wasn't just some random person who isn't had an action family who didn't know them so far as supportive and made this thing but this was someone who was awfully supportive in the past which almost legitimizes his extreme views and you know they've asked that with that in mind that we pursue litigation against Kanye.",subjective,kanye

We fought for moral reasons. We passed laws, struck down laws for moral reasons. We waged wars on poverty enough for people. We sacrificed, we cared about our neighbors. We put our money where our mouths were, and we never beat our chests.

Congress loves getting Tiktok CEOs in front of them to ask them questions, but as we've seen before, they're not necessarily knowledgeable about the specifics. For example, Tiktok doesn't sell data, it uses it to target ads. There's also no evidence that it's shared data with the Chinese government. However, there's also not a lot of hard and fast boundaries between Tiktok's parent company bytdance, which is based in Beijing, in the Chinese government. So it's really tough to keep track of where all that data goes. Now the government might try to ban Tiktok, which is already tried on successfully once under Trump's presidency. It could also try to force a sale to an American company, which the Chinese government has said it would oppose. Or it could pass comprehensive privacy legislation, which would force Tiktok to scale down its data collection.

Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can't do a damn thing to me. Ova Chaz, I thought you were better than that. Please, remove the pedestal that you have placed under my feet. I am not perfect. I cuss like a sailor. I was raised in the street. I spend a lot of my time crafting my stories for Chick-Tok. And I have to be very careful what I say on here. You'd be surprised at what words you are not allowed to say. And while I have to say that I was assayed or I was molested as a child, whenever I'm telling those stories, by the way, would you rather hear those stories than the word fuck? I mean, like, is the word fuck so offensive after I just told you that I got molested when I was 12 by a 40-year-old man? Really? I'm not putting your comments up here. I'm not going to send people to your page to hate on you. I'm not going to do any of that. I think you're coming from a place of sincerity in which somehow you actually do think that you can tell me what to say or how to say it. And you can express your discontent for it. If you're not happy with what I say, you can scroll on. You don't have to follow me. The fact that you do follow me is nice. I appreciate it. But you don't have to. My goal here is to be as real and person as I am here on TikTok. I'm honest. I tell you the truth and it's not going to be coming to you in a candy-coded fashion. I'm going to cuss. It's going to happen from time to time. You must not watch Showtime or HBO or Netflix. Look, I get three minutes to tell a story here and I have to edit it down to meet the guidelines. And you cannot tell a whole story in just three minutes. There's always more to every story. Trust me. The main thing for me is that I am not inhibited. Not here, not anywhere. My freedom of speech is important to me and I will express myself as I see fit when I see fit. I have well over a half a million followers on here and I haven't even been here a year yet.

I wanted to hop on here really quickly in my authentic form because I wanted to express what was in my mind about me deactivating my Facebook. This video is gonna be in the role. I'm a little emotional. I don't know good ones bad ones whatever but I see now why people post videos and then crying on the internet. Yeah. So I've had the same Facebook page since 2007. I've had the same Facebook page for 16 years. I've never like started a new page. I've never gotten hacked or anything like that. And so many people who are not familiar with TikTok always talk shit about TikTok right? They're like I don't have a TikTok and whatever people have their misconception about what it is. But what they don't realize is TikTok is more of who you are and not what TikTok is. And with Facebook I feel like it's a little different. And I've been putting this all finn has been weighing heavy all me like for the last few months and the reason why I didn't want to deactivate it and create a new page yet is because my mother passed away a couple years ago and I'm the legacy holder or I'm the legacy person on her account which means I can access her account and make decisions post on her page delete friends add friends and everything like that. I didn't want to let that last connection go but it's time. I don't know about you guys but I went through a phase where most people do like where I was adding every single friend request or adding every single suggestion if I knew if I had enough mutual friends and there's like almost 5,000 people in my Facebook and I couldn't tell you how many of them I actually know. I have some important photos on there, some good content you know things like that like from my blog, from my rental, some really really important memories that I hold dear to my heart so I know that it's going to be a process and with everything already have going on I know this is going to take me maybe a week or two to actually save the things I want from my Facebook and put it to the side. But what I finally understand and what I need to understand is that like waking up and getting on social media that is putting a lot of bad things or not bad things but like a lot of emotionally draining or emotionally pulling things or triggering things like in your face and the morning or anytime of day to get a distraction you know we scroll in there for a boosa serotonin or whatever and we get a notification and we're like oh you know that just puts us in a better mood hormonally right instantly for just a moment of instant gratification but there are so many things that are like trash on my Facebook trashed me that put me in a bad headspace. Like a lot of times I would just see something and you know just keep scrolling whatever not interact with it you know because it's freedom of speech right anybody can post whatever they want on their page I'm not saying I'm better than anybody else I'm not saying that I'm not saying I'm judging anyone else like who am I to judge I have some things on my Facebook over the last 16 years that I'm sure I would not think about posting today. Like the other day there was some random guy that posted corn right I instantly unfriended unfollowed them. There was someone else that posted like the super massagingistic comment on someone's page there's someone that posted this gorgeous heavy set white girl with like piercings and pink hair and it was a new profile picture that she made for herself and somebody shared her profile picture saying why are we low in our standards so much there are people that are my real friends in my and our friends in my real life that are friends with people on social media that like just judge judge judge or talk so mean like just talk so mean about people and and it's just it's overwhelming sometimes the video that just took me out that I saw was like someone posted a video of like six guys jumping someone and jail and stabbing him to death while someone recorded and he posted it and was like damn I know that Facebook and other social media can be used like you to keep us in a loop for the news right with these new generations everyone like having you know us having that worldwide like touch where we can see what's going on all the world when it's not really covered in the news I get that and I also understand that it helps to keep connections with people that are far away that you won't see for years. My TikTok feed expresses or falls in line with who I am as a person so yes I will be deactivating my Facebook and I will be creating a new Facebook page I'm not worried about the friend count anymore I'm 33 who cares about that I'll add the people that I actually have connections with that I actually know because all those examples of those posts that I saw it was from people that I'd have no idea who they are and we're friends so anyway it's going to be like an emotional process I won't be able to again access my mom's account anymore I'll still be able to see her account you know I'm not going to deactivate her Facebook or anything like that because I could I'm not going to deactivate her Facebook back and always go back and scroll through her pictures and things like that but as far as for me I'm going to take the next couple of days or week or whatever and pull all the members that I want to keep and then I'll create a new Facebook page with everything I have going on in my life mentally and physically and everything like that and everything that you may have going on in yours it may be time for you to reflect and remove some things that you know would be triggering for that anyways happy Sunday thanks for coming to my TED Talk and I don't know have a good day",subjective,social media

They do not want us to be on TikTok where we can share ideas and communicate with each other. TikTok has been an invaluable tool for me as a neurodivergent person that has struggled making friends. It is very easy to make friends on TikTok as a neurodivergent because it unites us and creates community for us in ways that are hard to do in the real world.

In today's issue of pink news, it's featured that a Canadian family moved to Russia to escape wokeness and LGBTQ people, and it didn't go well. Weird. The YouTuber patriarch of the right-wing Canadian family, Aaron Feonstra, decided that he'd had enough of gay people existing in his country. So he decided to take his family to Russia instead. He said that they did not feel safe for their children in Canada and their children's future anymore. He's an avowedly Christian dad of eight. But there were a few little details that the Feonstras forgot to work out before they moved to Russia to get away from gay people, such as learning Russian, because once they got there, and Neesa Feonstra was faced with trying to choose which bathroom to use and didn't speak Russian. And of course in Russia, you have to use the bathroom for the sex that you were assigned to at birth. And she said, I needed to use the washroom, and on the doors it said male and female, but I didn't know which was which. In America, that wouldn't be a problem. It's a free-for-all in the bathrooms. And then there was the fact that they failed to find out whether or not their credit cards would work in Russia, which they don't. And then the fact that they plunked a large sum of cash into a Russian bank account that was subsequently seized by the Russian government because of the possibility of money laundering. This caused Neesa to throw a fairly large temper tantrum on their YouTube, criticizing the Russian government pretty heavily. And who would have thought that a government that does not allow people to express themselves in their sexual orientation or their sexual identification would actually not allow you to criticize the government openly? So this caused their Russian handlers to sort of wrap them on the knuckles according to this article. And they pulled back their criticism of the government and said, no, we're not frustrated with the government. We're just frustrated with ourselves here in this country. So now all 10 of the family members are living in a two-room apartment because all of their money was frozen in a bank account by the Russian government. They can't use their visa or their master card or any of that. And they don't have the funds to buy the farm that they had hoped to buy. And they don't speak Russian.

That's the next topic we're going to cover. Tennessee right now is in a really shit position, especially considering everything that's going on. So what is freedom of speech? You look it up, it's going to say a principal that sports the freedom of an individual or community to articulate their opinions, ideas without the fear of retaliation, censorship or legal sanctioned. Freedom of expression interchangeably is recognized as a human right by the UN. And a freedom of expression includes any activity of seeking, receiving, imparting information ideas regardless of the media amused. What that means is when Senado Conner, way back in the day, tore a picture of the Pope. That's freedom of speech. When somebody is out in corner saying, you know, everybody is going to hell holding a sign. That's freedom of speech. It's a very big deal here in the United States. But it appears lately that that is no longer an option. Freedom of speech is disappearing. Now to start with whether you want to look at the overall situation happening in Tennessee, they're ousting three members due to them standing with their constituents over gun violence. Right now, OU, in Norman has a shooting that's happening. Haven't been able to see what's going on on the flip side of it. But clearly guns are an issue. I am a gun owner. I do carry a pistol with me. That doesn't mean there's not an issue. The situation we're running into is which right takes precedence, the right of human life, the right to talk about it, or the right to own. The answer to that is all of them take precedence. But for people to be ousted from their position in the legislature for standing with their constituents is fucking crazy. Okay, freedom of speech is everything to this country. And that includes fucking drag queens. Whether or not you like them is irrelevant. Right. The definition itself is an individual or community that wants to articulate an opinion.

We're going to talk more about your rights to freedom of speech and expression under the First Amendment. If you attend public school, you generally have the same free speech rights as anyone else when it comes to what you say, right, where, or otherwise express yourself. But there are limits because of the importance of maintaining an orderly learning environment. Your school can prohibit speech that's disruptive or interferes with the rights of others. For example, your speech or expression might be something that's only okay. But if it interferes with your classmates right to an education, you probably can't do it. Schools can also limit speech that's vulgar or offensive. And the Supreme Court has even ruled in some situations, schools can limit speech they find to be inappropriate.

This is government overreach that wreaks a big brother where our politicians are telling us that they know better than we do what's good for us. But we are a free country. We're not China, North Korea or Russia. Here are some simple steps to tell our government that they should not do what they are trying to do to us. First is to send a message to your congressperson. Go to house.gov and put your zip code in here to look up who your congressperson is. That person will show up and then send an email right through here. Second is to send a message to your two senators. Go to senate.gov and then find your senators, put your state in, and it will give you your two senators. And from there you can click the contact form to send them a message. Third, you can send a message to the president himself. Go to whitehouse.gov, hit menu. It will open this menu up and then go to the contact us, portion, and leave a message. And finally, I just started petition on change.org to stop the TikTok ban. If you can take a second to sign the petition, it will tell our government that there are 100 million Americans who do not want them to ban TikTok.

Well, just personally, I was really extremely disappointed. And it's I guess a bit strange to be continually disappointed by Kanye West, but I didn't hear about it since until Sunday morning when the brother of George Floyd Clownis gave me a call and said, he was I ring. He was extremely hurt by the statements that Kanye West made. I had to go look up the interview and see that he was now blame in a drug overdose and a theory that was well debunked in court as you all pointed out, something that is clearly not the reason that George Floyd died. He died as a a bearish chauvin's knee and the other officers compressing his body in a prone position. And now he's promulgating those statements are new in a way that is it almost seemed designed to cause the family distress. And so they reached out to me specifically his brother and asked that we again investigate whether or not we can restrain him from making such statements and hold him accountable for the misinformation that he's putting out there. How serious are they about doing something against Kanye West? I know that Clownis Floyd, for example, was bothered that I said we were considering lawsuit. He is absolutely committed to bringing lawsuit and I've heard from other members of the family who are represented by various parties saying that they are absolutely 100% moving forward with litigation against Kanye West and anyone else who would defend George Floyd in his reputation. Part of what makes this so upsetting for the family is that after George was murdered Kanye West was one of many people celebrities who reached out and I believe he even made a donation to pay for George's daughter's college tuition. So I know there was some appreciation that was expressed by the family back then and then now to hear him saying things like this. You know that that actually did come up in the conversation I had with Clownis. A part of the conversation was one of the Cooper Jones, a mod Arbiter's mother and those families that Floyd family and the Arbiter family are friends and when this kind of injury takes place when someone undermines their movement they support each other. The two of them called me together and they said that they saw Kanye West as a friend and that's why this was personal for them that it wasn't just some random person who isn't had an action family who didn't know them so far as supportive and made this thing but this was someone who was awfully supportive in the past which almost legitimizes his extreme views and you know they've asked that with that in mind that we pursue litigation against Kanye.",subjective,george floyd

It is the freedom to express your political beliefs that the Constitution of the United States protects at the highest levels. It is the highest standard to meet. If you want to stop somebody from making a political statement, the courts will ask you, what is your justification and it better be damn good. Usually it falls. For example, you can have a rule that says there's no lawn signs allowed in this neighborhood or in this town. Some towns you can't have any lawn signs of any kind. That's okay. But if you say you can't have political lawn signs, that's a problem. Because that violates the expression of the people and you're singling out content. It gets very complicated.

And I was particularly perturbed when I saw a video of a guy taking videos at a post office or whatever he was doing. And I'm sure you've seen these videos. And the cop asks him, what are your journalist papers? Well, there is no such thing. Under the United States Constitution, the First Amendment, the freedom of the press. It doesn't define press. It does not give the government the ability to say, you're the press and you're not. Who is the press? Will are. Especially now, people regularly post tick talks about the government. I certainly do. I criticize CPS and bad police every day. No one gave me a license. No one could stop me from videotaping in public. CNN and Fox News don't ask the federal government for a license to broadcast what they want to broadcast. It is the freedom to express your political beliefs that the Constitution of the United States protects at the highest levels. It is the highest standard to meet. If you want to stop somebody from making a political statement, the courts will ask you, what is your justification and it better be damn good. Usually it falls. For example, you can have a rule that says there's no lawn signs allowed in this neighborhood or in this town. Some towns you can't have any lawn signs of any kind. That's okay. But if you say you can't have political lawn signs, that's a problem. Because that violates the expression of the people and you're singling out content. It gets very complicated. But let's just state with the facts that no government issues licenses for anybody to be journalist. We have the right to express our political beliefs and seek redress from government.

It's important to create safe spaces for journalists and not to tolerate any form of bullying online. Journalism, press freedom is the foundation of all our freedoms. We must hold on to it tightly and not let it go.",subjective,press freedom

This man behind me is Evan Gershkiewicz and this is our campaign to free Evan because Evan has been incarcerated in prison in Russia for the last few weeks. What's his crime? Being a reporter. This is an attack on the free press and it's also an attack on Jews because he is the child of Soviet Jews and Soviet Jews suffered for so long under the impression of the Soviets. He is the first foreign journalist to be charged with espionage in Russia since the Cold War. The White House has critiqued this calling it ridiculous and demanded for his release and we need to stay on top of the White House and Congress in the Senate to do all they can to release him. The journal where he was working was similarly denied any accusations of spying and just described his arrest as a vicious front to a free press. There is no existing evidence that Gershkiewicz was a spy. He was merely a reporter and many experts believe his detention is actually meant to intimidate foreign correspondents who remain in the country. This is an attack on the press worldwide. Friends, a record number of journalists were imprisoned in 2022. The sign of the weakening press freedom worldwide according to the committee to protect journalists saying that there were 363 journalists detained in more than 30 countries last year. With the highest number of detainees held in Iran, China and Myanmar. This is not only a global problem, it's right here in America too. The former US president constantly attacked the press and saying the press is the enemy of the people. So friends, what can we do? Number one, we need to advocate with the White House and Congress in Senate to do all possible to free Evan. We can't let any reporters ever be incarcerated from doing the job of ensuring a free press. Number two, you can email Evan. We can't guarantee it will get through, but his team will translate it to Russia and try to get it to give him strength and resolve on the inside. Email freegurishgivich at gmail.com. And thirdly, we need to plaster social media with his face and with his story until he is free so that we can ensure we can stop the evil regime of Putin who has been attacking Ukraine, is attacking the free press and not setting off a whole global trend where reporters are afraid to do their job. Let's do this for Evan. Let's do this for Soviet Jews. Let's do this for freedom of press. Let's do this for the sake of Putin's Congress.",subjective,press freedom

We also know that the oil tanker has laced to the UK and flies under the flank of the Marshall Islands. Now the Iran-backed movement says it targeted the Marlonalanda in response to American British aggression may claim. Following that attack, the US military says they acted in self-defense earlier today. After they struck and destroyed a Houthi anti-ship missile aimed at the Red Sea. US Central Command forced to say it presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels they claim. And the US Navy ships in the region saying that Yemen missile was ready to launch at any moment. Now since November the movement and the Houthis have launched dozens of attacks on commercial vessels traveling through the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, of course. Forcing companies to divert their vessels around South Africa, which has been slowing trade down significantly. The Houthis say they're targeting vessels in support of Palestinians in Gaza. In response, the US and UK have launched airstrikes on Houthi targets triggering this kind of back and forth motion that we've been seeing. Today, tens of thousands gathered in the Yemen capital, though, to reject the US British airstrikes over the Red Sea. And to show support for Palestinians in Gaza, meanwhile, national security spokesperson John Kirby saying on Wednesday that the types are effective and other countries are supporting them. Certainly, I'm also sure that you saw yesterday a joint statement from 24 countries expressing support for the action of the United States and our United Kingdom Armed Forces with support in Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Netherlands, took against the loodies on Monday.

And I was particularly perturbed when I saw a video of a guy taking videos at a post office or whatever he was doing. And I'm sure you've seen these videos. And the cop asks him, what are your journalist papers? Well, there is no such thing. Under the United States Constitution, the First Amendment, the freedom of the press. It doesn't define press. It does not give the government the ability to say, you're the press and you're not. Who is the press? Will are. Especially now, people regularly post tick talks about the government. I certainly do. I criticize CPS and bad police every day. No one gave me a license. No one could stop me from videotaping in public. CNN and Fox News don't ask the federal government for a license to broadcast what they want to broadcast. It is the freedom to express your political beliefs that the Constitution of the United States protects at the highest levels. It is the highest standard to meet. If you want to stop somebody from making a political statement, the courts will ask you, what is your justification and it better be damn good. Usually it falls. For example, you can have a rule that says there's no lawn signs allowed in this neighborhood or in this town. Some towns you can't have any lawn signs of any kind. That's okay. But if you say you can't have political lawn signs, that's a problem. Because that violates the expression of the people and you're singling out content. It gets very complicated. But let's just state with the facts that no government issues licenses for anybody to be journalist. We have the right to express our political beliefs and seek redress from government. Whichever way we believe because we are the people and that's where a law talk.",subjective,press freedom

They are 103 voices that Israel has silenced. 103 fewer witnesses because of the catastrophe unfolding in Palestine. 103 lives extinguished.

I've already gone through the key cases for freedom of speech and for freedom of religion. So now let's tackle freedom of the press. Here are some key cases. First let's talk about Gitlow, V. New York. This case was decided in 1925. And the reason this case is so important is because it's this case that incorporated freedom of press and freedom of speech to the states. I've talked about the incorporation doctrine before but just know not all rights in the Bill of Rights have been incorporated to the states. But freedom of the press was through the Gitlow case. Next we've got people V. Croswell. This case was way before that in 1804. It's an interesting case having to do with libel, Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. So take a look at that one. After that we've got near V. Minnesota and this is a particular case regarding prior restraint on publications and whether or not it's constitutional. And along with the near case we have New York Times V. U.S. and this is the 1971 case that has to do with President Nixon and the Vietnam War. Next we have New York Times V. Sullivan, which is a separate case in 1971. This has to do with the defamation test regarding public figures. Then we have Garrison V. Louisiana. This was decided in 1964 and it sets out more information on that reckless disregard for the truth when it comes to publishing something. And next we've got Hazelwood School District V. Colmeyer. This case was decided in 1988 and it's set out that school newspapers are a different animal than regular newspapers. And the way that they can be regulated is much different. And those are arguably the most important landmark freedom of the press cases.",subjective,press freedom

And basically put them on notice that providing material support to Hamas is illegal. They write quote, we will continue to follow your reporting to ensure that your organizations do not violate any federal or state laws by giving material support to terrorists abroad. Now your organizations are on notice, follow the law. Wow. So the AGs continue to define what material support would mean. They're criminalizing freedom of the press. And so it cancel culture, anti-freedom, and going after the press. If you dare criticize Israel, we might put you in jail in America. This is crazy. And I'm also curious about what this would mean for ordinary Americans, right? Let's say their ordinary Americans who are on social media, they come across certain content that they want to share, but that content is labeled or considered propaganda from Hamas and disseminating it or sharing it would amount to providing support for Hamas. Does that mean that ordinary citizens would get prosecuted or investigated? I'm serious, I know that sounds hyperbolic and crazy, but this is such a vague law. So what, you're not allowed to criticize a political movement? That's insane. Our Congress has lost its mind. Our Congress is totally and utterly corrupt. So everyone who signed on to that bill is a total disaster. Well, a lot of people did. The House voted in favor of the resolution and it passed 311 to 14, only 14 members of Congress voted against it. All 311 people of those are corrupt. They are. That's an outrageous, ridiculous, un-American, unconstitutional bill to pass. By the way, spring courts just shrank that down. So now you're not allowed to criticize political movements, because, by the way, you've criticized any political movement you like in America, but you're not allowed to criticize political movement in another country. That's insane, guys. And by the way, this helps the cause of anti-Semitism. Because then it allows people to go, well, I guess they control the United States Congress, I guess they control all the media and they control all the attorney's channel. It's actually not true. It's not true, but this doesn't help. This doesn't help. An A-packing, a Democratic majority for Israel going around threatening everybody. We'll spend millions of dollars in your primaries unless you listen to Austin Israel. That doesn't help the cause of fighting anti-Semitism. That makes it 10,000 times worse.

The president of the South Sudan Union of Journalists said the journalists are being questioned on how the video of the President urinating himself came out. The government has long denied rumors that 71-year-old President Kier, who has been in power since South Sudan's independence in 2011, is unwell. By law, authorities cannot detain someone for more than 24 hours without bringing charges against them. The journalists have been in custody for a week, and are believed to be held at the National Security Headquarters in the capital, Juba.",subjective,political scandal

How long is basic training and how much do you get paid? So basic training is 10 weeks long and you can expect to make between 5,000 and 5,500 while you're there. You're going to get paid on the first and the 15th religiously and you have really nothing to spend your money on. Your housing is paid for, your food is paid for, your clothing is covered. So when you get that check on the first and the 15th, it's really just stacking up in your bank account because you have nothing to spend. Your money on the side from soap and you know toothpaste and stuff, you want to brush teeth. But that's about it. So when you come back from training, you have this money sitting in your bank account and it's yours to do what you choose with it. So you either can, you know, do a down payment on a car. If you're starting a business, you can invest into your business. Whatever it is that you want to do with this money, you're free to do so because it is yours.

Learn to think like a lawyer for free for two months by clicking on the link in the description. Hey, Legal Eagles, it's time to think like a lawyer, because the president could use some good advice unlike the bad legal advice he seems to be getting at the moment. Today, we're going to discuss one of the newest scandals to rock the White House, the allegations of bribery and potential abuse of power by President Trump in exchange for getting dirt on presidential candidate Joe Biden. All hell seems to be breaking loose here in Washington, and although you could probably say that on any given day, this time it seems to be a little different because of one thing. House Democrats have announced that they are formally opening an inquiry into the impeachment of the president of the United States. This doesn't happen every day. To understand how we got here, you need to know the facts about Donald Trump's conversation with the president of Ukraine, a mysterious high-level whistleblower, the many faces of Rudy Giuliani, and what all that has to do with Joe Biden's son. So, to take a step back, Ukraine is a country in Eastern Europe that was formally a part of the Soviet Union. The country currently has a rocky relationship with Russia because Russian troops have invaded part of Ukraine's territory, the Crimea, back in 2014. Ukrainian citizens protested Russian involvement in their government, ousting President Viktor Yanukovych for conspiring with Russia. Now, the United States and most of the world condemned Russia and warned it against further interference in Ukrainian sovereignty. Later that same year, then Vice President Biden went to Ukraine to deliver U.S. aid. Now, fast forward a few years, in July of 2019, the Washington Post reported that a high-ranking intelligence official had filed a whistleblower complaint about promises that President Trump had made during communication and interaction with a foreign leader. Several news organizations reported that this whistleblower complaint involved President Trump promising aid to Ukraine if they dug up some dirt on Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son. Trump himself confirmed part of the story. Hunter Biden was a member of the board of a company called Berezma Holdings, the largest gas company in Ukraine. That company was known for having some ties to former President of Ukraine, Viktor Viennikoviƒá. Hunter Biden remained a board member of Berezma until 2019. So, what is the deal with this intelligence community whistleblower? Well, I probably don't need to tell you that it is incredibly unusual for a member of the intelligence community to, number one, file a whistleblower complaint. There are strict guidelines that one must follow in order to blow the whistle on the intelligence community. And it is almost unheard of that a whistleblower would blow the whistle on the President of the United States. That just has never happened before. And on September 9th, intelligence community general inspector or the ICIG, Michael Ackinson informed representatives Adam Schiff and Devon Nunez, who were on the House Intelligence Committee, that he had forwarded a whistleblower report to acting director of National Intelligence Joseph McGuire. A whistleblower is a person who exposes information that he or she believes is illegal or unethical. Governmental whistleblowers are not unusual, but a whistleblower at this level of the government in the intelligence community, making an allegation of the President absolutely is incredibly unusual. Inspector Ackinson determined that the report was, quote, an urgent concern, end quote, and quote, credible. Urgent and credible are two statutory requirements that require the ICIG to forward the complaint to Congress. Ackinson's ruling immediately made this a very serious allegation that Congress wanted to review. However, acting director of National Intelligence McGuire stepped in to claim that the complaint was not required to be released to Congress. Now remember this fact about acting DNI McGuire as we'll come back to it later. This fact could be the first indication of a cover-up by the White House and the Department of Justice. At the time of this video, we don't have all of the facts, we don't have the entire ICIG complaint, but news reports are indicating that President Trump may have threatened to withhold $400 million in military aid to Ukraine if it did not investigate Hunter Biden among other things. The Trump administration had criticized the Obama administration for not providing lethal foreign aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. So earlier this year, Congress appropriated almost $400 million in military aid, $250 million in explicit military aid and $150 million going through the State Department, that can be used for lethal force by the Ukrainians to buy military goods from the Americans. The argument, of course, being that Ukraine needs that military aid to help fight against Russia in Crimea and was approved by the Pentagon and Congress. However, for months, President Trump froze that military aid. Some reports indicate that government employees were instructed to obfuscate or lie to Congress about the reason for why that money was frozen. It's not necessarily unusual to freeze this kind of military aid, but under these circumstances it appears to be highly unusual and we'll get to why in just a moment. Although there is much speculation over the contents of the whistleblower report, President Trump and his personal lawyer and advisor Rudy Giuliani started confirming aspects of this particular story just days after it was broken. President Trump spoke with new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by telephone on July 25th, just days after Robert Mueller had testified in Congress. When President Trump allegedly mentioned his desire to have Biden investigated up to eight times. According to Trump, he summarizes phone call saying, We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption, picking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden has done, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine. Ukraine's got a lot of problems. President Trump described the phone call as, quote, perfect. It's very important to talk about corruption. If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt? So it's very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption. So President Trump agrees that he spoke about alleged corruption by the Biden's, and that he also was reluctant to give money to Ukraine because he says the country is corrupt. A potential flaw with this argument is that the United States gives military aid to many different countries, not the least of which is Saudi Arabia, but the President does not seem to be doing any kind of corruption analysis with respect to those other countries. This may be specifically geared towards Ukraine and these unusual circumstances. The President Trump wasn't done yet. Speaking a few days later at the United Nations, President Trump said, Joe Biden and his son are corrupt. All right, but the fake news doesn't want to report it because they're Democrats. If that ever happened, if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, then beginning the electric chair by right now. So what is it that President Trump alleges the Biden's did? President Trump alleges that Joe Biden used American financial aid to pressure the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor in 2016. The theory is that the prosecutor, Victor Shokin, was investigating Ukraine's largest gas company, Berizma. Although President Trump has been vague about what the Biden's did that deserved the so-called electric chair, the corruption allegations have been investigated and dismissed. Shokin was accused of being soft on corruption. The United States was not alone in calling for his ouster. Other Western nations in the entire European Union also called on Ukraine to remove him. And the Ukrainian parliament eventually voted to remove Shokin. According to Bloomberg News, which did an extensive report on the matter in 2019, the Berizma investigation had already been dead for about a year by the time the vice president Biden called for Shokin to be sacked. And there is no indication that Hunter Biden personally was being investigated for corruption. The former Ukrainian prosecutor general told Bloomberg that he found no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden. But President Trump would not let that debunked story die, stating Biden, quote, said, I'm not going to give billions of dollars to Ukraine unless they remove this prosecutor. And they removed the prosecutor supposedly in one hour. And the prosecutor was prosecuting the company of the son and the son. He just shouldn't have said that. Now as far as my conversation, it was perfect. It was a perfect conversation. As you may be aware, Joe Biden has consistently been the Democratic front runner against President Trump in the 2020 presidential election and has consistently led Donald Trump in head-to-head polls. President Trump and Rudy Giuliani have already confirmed many aspects, although not all of the aspects of this particular story. So what's going up with Rudy Giuliani, you may ask. Well, Rudy Giuliani is one of the president's personal lawyers. He has no formal job with the US government, but allegedly has been acting as a messenger for President Trump with Ukraine.

Giuliani said that during the August meeting, a Ukrainian official promised to, quote, get to the bottom, end quote, of the Biden situation.

Despite being a founding member of the Senate whistleblower protection caucus, Ron Johnson called for outing the Trump whistleblower in 2019. Is it reasonable for an anonymous informant to remain anonymous? That's not a reasonable expectation on the part of whistleblowers. They ought to realize that for the level of those charges.

Learn to think like a lawyer for free for two months by clicking on the link in the description. Hey, Legal Eagles, it's time to think like a lawyer, because the president could use some good advice unlike the bad legal advice he seems to be getting at the moment. Today, we're going to discuss one of the newest scandals to rock the White House, the allegations of bribery and potential abuse of power by President Trump in exchange for getting dirt on presidential candidate Joe Biden. All hell seems to be breaking loose here in Washington, and although you could probably say that on any given day, this time it seems to be a little different because of one thing. House Democrats have announced that they are formally opening an inquiry into the impeachment of the president of the United States. This doesn't happen every day. To understand how we got here, you need to know the facts about Donald Trump's conversation with the president of Ukraine, a mysterious high-level whistleblower, the many faces of Rudy Giuliani, and what all that has to do with Joe Biden's son. So, to take a step back, Ukraine is a country in Eastern Europe that was formally a part of the Soviet Union. The country currently has a rocky relationship with Russia because Russian troops have invaded part of Ukraine's territory, the Crimea, back in 2014. Ukrainian citizens protested Russian involvement in their government, ousting President Viktor Yanukovych for conspiring with Russia. Now, the United States and most of the world condemned Russia and warned it against further interference in Ukrainian sovereignty. Later that same year, then Vice President Biden went to Ukraine to deliver U.S. aid. Now, fast forward a few years, in July of 2019, the Washington Post reported that a high-ranking intelligence official had filed a whistleblower complaint about promises that President Trump had made during communication and interaction with a foreign leader. Several news organizations reported that this whistleblower complaint involved President Trump promising aid to Ukraine if they dug up some dirt on Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son. Trump himself confirmed part of the story. Hunter Biden was a member of the board of a company called Berezma Holdings, the largest gas company in Ukraine. That company was known for having some ties to former President of Ukraine, Viktor Viennikoviƒá. Hunter Biden remained a board member of Berezma until 2019. So, what is the deal with this intelligence community whistleblower? Well, I probably don't need to tell you that it is incredibly unusual for a member of the intelligence community to, number one, file a whistleblower complaint. There are strict guidelines that one must follow in order to blow the whistle on the intelligence community. And it is almost unheard of that a whistleblower would blow the whistle on the President of the United States. That just has never happened before. And on September 9th, intelligence community general inspector or the ICIG, Michael Ackinson informed representatives Adam Schiff and Devon Nunez, who were on the House Intelligence Committee, that he had forwarded a whistleblower report to acting director of National Intelligence Joseph McGuire. A whistleblower is a person who exposes information that he or she believes is illegal or unethical. Governmental whistleblowers are not unusual, but a whistleblower at this level of the government in the intelligence community, making an allegation of the President absolutely is incredibly unusual. Inspector Ackinson determined that the report was, quote, an urgent concern, end quote, and quote, credible. Urgent and credible are two statutory requirements that require the ICIG to forward the complaint to Congress. Ackinson's ruling immediately made this a very serious allegation that Congress wanted to review. However, acting director of National Intelligence McGuire stepped in to claim that the complaint was not required to be released to Congress. Now remember this fact about acting DNI McGuire as we'll come back to it later. This fact could be the first indication of a cover-up by the White House and the Department of Justice. At the time of this video, we don't have all of the facts, we don't have the entire ICIG complaint, but news reports are indicating that President Trump may have threatened to withhold $400 million in military aid to Ukraine if it did not investigate Hunter Biden among other things. The Trump administration had criticized the Obama administration for not providing lethal foreign aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. So earlier this year, Congress appropriated almost $400 million in military aid, $250 million in explicit military aid and $150 million going through the State Department, that can be used for lethal force by the Ukrainians to buy military goods from the Americans. The argument, of course, being that Ukraine needs that military aid to help fight against Russia in Crimea and was approved by the Pentagon and Congress. However, for months, President Trump froze that military aid. Some reports indicate that government employees were instructed to obfuscate or lie to Congress about the reason for why that money was frozen. It's not necessarily unusual to freeze this kind of military aid, but under these circumstances it appears to be highly unusual and we'll get to why in just a moment. Although there is much speculation over the contents of the whistleblower report, President Trump and his personal lawyer and advisor Rudy Giuliani started confirming aspects of this particular story just days after it was broken. President Trump spoke with new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by telephone on July 25th, just days after Robert Mueller had testified in Congress. When President Trump allegedly mentioned his desire to have Biden investigated up to eight times. According to Trump, he summarizes phone call saying, We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption, picking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden has done, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine. Ukraine's got a lot of problems. President Trump described the phone call as, quote, perfect. It's very important to talk about corruption. If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt? So it's very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption. So President Trump agrees that he spoke about alleged corruption by the Biden's, and that he also was reluctant to give money to Ukraine because he says the country is corrupt. A potential flaw with this argument is that the United States gives military aid to many different countries, not the least of which is Saudi Arabia, but the President does not seem to be doing any kind of corruption analysis with respect to those other countries. This may be specifically geared towards Ukraine and these unusual circumstances. The President Trump wasn't done yet. Speaking a few days later at the United Nations, President Trump said, Joe Biden and his son are corrupt. All right, but the fake news doesn't want to report it because they're Democrats. If that ever happened, if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, then beginning the electric chair by right now. So what is it that President Trump alleges the Biden's did? President Trump alleges that Joe Biden used American financial aid to pressure the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor in 2016. The theory is that the prosecutor, Victor Shokin, was investigating Ukraine's largest gas company, Berizma. Although President Trump has been vague about what the Biden's did that deserved the so-called electric chair, the corruption allegations have been investigated and dismissed. Shokin was accused of being soft on corruption. The United States was not alone in calling for his ouster. Other Western nations in the entire European Union also called on Ukraine to remove him. And the Ukrainian parliament eventually voted to remove Shokin. According to Bloomberg News, which did an extensive report on the matter in 2019, the Berizma investigation had already been dead for about a year by the time the vice president Biden called for Shokin to be sacked. And there is no indication that Hunter Biden personally was being investigated for corruption. The former Ukrainian prosecutor general told Bloomberg that he found no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden. But President Trump would not let that debunked story die, stating Biden, quote, said, I'm not going to give billions of dollars to Ukraine unless they remove this prosecutor. And they removed the prosecutor supposedly in one hour. And the prosecutor was prosecuting the company of the son and the son. He just shouldn't have said that. Now as far as my conversation, it was perfect. It was a perfect conversation. As you may be aware, Joe Biden has consistently been the Democratic front runner against President Trump in the 2020 presidential election and has consistently led Donald Trump in head-to-head polls. President Trump and Rudy Giuliani have already confirmed many aspects, although not all of the aspects of this particular story. So what's going up with Rudy Giuliani, you may ask. Well, Rudy Giuliani is one of the president's personal lawyers. He has no formal job with the US government, but allegedly has been acting as a messenger for President Trump with Ukraine. In another one of Mr. Giuliani's legendary TV appearances, Giuliani has admitted that he spent several months pressuring Ukraine for dirt on the Biden's, appearing on Chris Cuomo's CNN program. Giuliani said, I have the only thing I asked about Joe Biden is to get to the bottom of how it was that Wood Sanko, who was appointed, dismissed the case against Antelope. So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden? Of course I did. So we already know that Giuliani met with Ukrainian officials in May and August of this year. The August meeting was just a week after President Trump froze all of the military aid that Congress and the Pentagon had appropriated for Ukraine. Giuliani said that during the August meeting, a Ukrainian official promised to, quote, get to the bottom, end quote, of the Biden situation. The Wall Street Journal reported that this was part of an ongoing effort by President Trump to have the Ukrainians work with Giuliani to find some dirt on the Biden's in exchange for the promised aid.

Learn to think like a lawyer for free for two months by clicking on the link in the description. Hey, Legal Eagles, it's time to think like a lawyer, because the president could use some good advice unlike the bad legal advice he seems to be getting at the moment. Today, we're going to discuss one of the newest scandals to rock the White House, the allegations of bribery and potential abuse of power by President Trump in exchange for getting dirt on presidential candidate Joe Biden. All hell seems to be breaking loose here in Washington, and although you could probably say that on any given day, this time it seems to be a little different because of one thing. House Democrats have announced that they are formally opening an inquiry into the impeachment of the president of the United States. This doesn't happen every day. To understand how we got here, you need to know the facts about Donald Trump's conversation with the president of Ukraine, a mysterious high-level whistleblower, the many faces of Rudy Giuliani, and what all that has to do with Joe Biden's son. So, to take a step back, Ukraine is a country in Eastern Europe that was formally a part of the Soviet Union. The country currently has a rocky relationship with Russia because Russian troops have invaded part of Ukraine's territory, the Crimea, back in 2014. Ukrainian citizens protested Russian involvement in their government, ousting President Viktor Yanukovych for conspiring with Russia. Now, the United States and most of the world condemned Russia and warned it against further interference in Ukrainian sovereignty. Later that same year, then Vice President Biden went to Ukraine to deliver U.S. aid. Now, fast forward a few years, in July of 2019, the Washington Post reported that a high-ranking intelligence official had filed a whistleblower complaint about promises that President Trump had made during communication and interaction with a foreign leader. Several news organizations reported that this whistleblower complaint involved President Trump promising aid to Ukraine if they dug up some dirt on Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son. Trump himself confirmed part of the story. Hunter Biden was a member of the board of a company called Berezma Holdings, the largest gas company in Ukraine. That company was known for having some ties to former President of Ukraine, Viktor Viennikoviƒá. Hunter Biden remained a board member of Berezma until 2019. So, what is the deal with this intelligence community whistleblower? Well, I probably don't need to tell you that it is incredibly unusual for a member of the intelligence community to, number one, file a whistleblower complaint. There are strict guidelines that one must follow in order to blow the whistle on the intelligence community. And it is almost unheard of that a whistleblower would blow the whistle on the President of the United States. That just has never happened before. And on September 9th, intelligence community general inspector or the ICIG, Michael Ackinson informed representatives Adam Schiff and Devon Nunez, who were on the House Intelligence Committee, that he had forwarded a whistleblower report to acting director of National Intelligence Joseph McGuire. A whistleblower is a person who exposes information that he or she believes is illegal or unethical. Governmental whistleblowers are not unusual, but a whistleblower at this level of the government in the intelligence community, making an allegation of the President absolutely is incredibly unusual. Inspector Ackinson determined that the report was, quote, an urgent concern, end quote, and quote, credible. Urgent and credible are two statutory requirements that require the ICIG to forward the complaint to Congress. Ackinson's ruling immediately made this a very serious allegation that Congress wanted to review. However, acting director of National Intelligence McGuire stepped in to claim that the complaint was not required to be released to Congress. Now remember this fact about acting DNI McGuire as we'll come back to it later. This fact could be the first indication of a cover-up by the White House and the Department of Justice. At the time of this video, we don't have all of the facts, we don't have the entire ICIG complaint, but news reports are indicating that President Trump may have threatened to withhold $400 million in military aid to Ukraine if it did not investigate Hunter Biden among other things. The Trump administration had criticized the Obama administration for not providing lethal foreign aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. So earlier this year, Congress appropriated almost $400 million in military aid, $250 million in explicit military aid and $150 million going through the State Department, that can be used for lethal force by the Ukrainians to buy military goods from the Americans. The argument, of course, being that Ukraine needs that military aid to help fight against Russia in Crimea and was approved by the Pentagon and Congress. However, for months, President Trump froze that military aid. Some reports indicate that government employees were instructed to obfuscate or lie to Congress about the reason for why that money was frozen. It's not necessarily unusual to freeze this kind of military aid, but under these circumstances it appears to be highly unusual and we'll get to why in just a moment. Although there is much speculation over the contents of the whistleblower report, President Trump and his personal lawyer and advisor Rudy Giuliani started confirming aspects of this particular story just days after it was broken. President Trump spoke with new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by telephone on July 25th, just days after Robert Mueller had testified in Congress. When President Trump allegedly mentioned his desire to have Biden investigated up to eight times. According to Trump, he summarizes phone call saying, We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption, picking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden has done, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine. Ukraine's got a lot of problems. President Trump described the phone call as, quote, perfect. It's very important to talk about corruption. If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt? So it's very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption. So President Trump agrees that he spoke about alleged corruption by the Biden's, and that he also was reluctant to give money to Ukraine because he says the country is corrupt. A potential flaw with this argument is that the United States gives military aid to many different countries, not the least of which is Saudi Arabia, but the President does not seem to be doing any kind of corruption analysis with respect to those other countries. This may be specifically geared towards Ukraine and these unusual circumstances. The President Trump wasn't done yet. Speaking a few days later at the United Nations, President Trump said, Joe Biden and his son are corrupt. All right, but the fake news doesn't want to report it because they're Democrats. If that ever happened, if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, then beginning the electric chair by right now. So what is it that President Trump alleges the Biden's did? President Trump alleges that Joe Biden used American financial aid to pressure the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor in 2016. The theory is that the prosecutor, Victor Shokin, was investigating Ukraine's largest gas company, Berizma. Although President Trump has been vague about what the Biden's did that deserved the so-called electric chair, the corruption allegations have been investigated and dismissed. Shokin was accused of being soft on corruption. The United States was not alone in calling for his ouster. Other Western nations in the entire European Union also called on Ukraine to remove him. And the Ukrainian parliament eventually voted to remove Shokin. According to Bloomberg News, which did an extensive report on the matter in 2019, the Berizma investigation had already been dead for about a year by the time the vice president Biden called for Shokin to be sacked. And there is no indication that Hunter Biden personally was being investigated for corruption. The former Ukrainian prosecutor general told Bloomberg that he found no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden. But President Trump would not let that debunked story die, stating Biden, quote, said, I'm not going to give billions of dollars to Ukraine unless they remove this prosecutor. And they removed the prosecutor supposedly in one hour. And the prosecutor was prosecuting the company of the son and the son. He just shouldn't have said that. Now as far as my conversation, it was perfect. It was a perfect conversation. As you may be aware, Joe Biden has consistently been the Democratic front runner against President Trump in the 2020 presidential election and has consistently led Donald Trump in head-to-head polls. President Trump and Rudy Giuliani have already confirmed many aspects, although not all of the aspects of this particular story. So what's going up with Rudy Giuliani, you may ask. Well, Rudy Giuliani is one of the president's personal lawyers. He has no formal job with the US government, but allegedly has been acting as a messenger for President Trump with Ukraine. In another one of Mr. Giuliani's legendary TV appearances, Giuliani has admitted that he spent several months pressuring Ukraine for dirt on the Biden's, appearing on Chris Cuomo's CNN program. Giuliani said, I have the only thing I asked about Joe Biden is to get to the bottom of how it was that Wood Sanko, who was appointed, dismissed the case against Antelope. So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden? Of course I did. So we already know that Giuliani met with Ukrainian officials in May and August of this year. The August meeting was just a week after President Trump froze all of the military aid that Congress and the Pentagon had appropriated for Ukraine. Giuliani said that during the August meeting, a Ukrainian official promised to, quote, get to the bottom, end quote, of the Biden situation. The Wall Street Journal reported that this was part of an ongoing effort by President Trump to have the Ukrainians work with Giuliani to find some dirt on the Biden's in exchange for the promised aid. Now, on its face, there are major problems with Giuliani's role in all of this. Giuliani is not a member of the US government and should not be conducting US foreign policy.",subjective,political scandal

You can recall what Democrats said back in the time when and the details are thus Donald Trump simply asked Ukraine and the president of Ukraine to look in to the Biden family corruption. A series of events that looks like extortion withholding aid to an ally and then quote-unquote asking for a favor to essentially benefit yourself politically. The bride is to pledge or withhold military assistance. The idea that somebody would withhold in badly needed weaponry for political reasons at home is beyond the tale. Now of course what was Donald Trump asking them to look into? He was asking them to look into situations like this where Joe Biden openly stated on camera that he used American taxpayer dollars in order to protect his son hunter from being investigated by Ukrainian special prosecutor. Here is Joe Biden on tape using a billion dollar blackmail against the government of Ukraine and he was proud of it. He got applauded for it. It's a son of a bitch. They fired the prosecutor go. I said no I said I'm not going to give you the billion dollars. They said you have no authority you're not the president. The president said I said call him. I said I'm telling you not get the billion dollars. I said you're not getting the billion dollars. I'm going to be leaving here and I think it was about six hours. I look at it and I said we even six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired you're not getting the money. Well son of a bitch. He fired. They put in place someone who was solid. I didn't know that this is all because of Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine. Hunter Biden demanded that Joe Biden do this and Joe Biden do tofully went down and protected his crack as he always does. So the question is how long will Joe Biden remain protected? This is the clearest example in my lifetime. By the way, Donald Trump didn't withhold any spending or funding from Ukraine. Donald Trump didn't withhold anything. Ukraine decided not to open up an investigation into the Biden's hilarious. And now of course we see what's happening at that region of the world. Of course the calamity and the collapse all stemming obviously from horrible and poor political decisions would have been a lot smarter to stick with the president to brought you peace. But now ladies and gentlemen the Biden's I think and quite frankly the global football have always wanted destruction for Ukraine. It's always been a bad route to take to be in league with people who are warmongers. Okay. This is why Tulsi Gabbard left the Democratic Party this week warmongers. But hey, I didn't make the decisions. You probably should have investigated Joe Biden. If someone's get announced that he was going to investigate Joe Biden and went after and prosecuted Hunter Biden and his son. Would we be in the world we're living in today? But he chose to side with the Biden's so whatever. Okay. Listen, we're sitting here. It's looking at this situation saying this is the clearest cut could pro quo we've ever seen in our life. You give me this and I'll give you that. Joe Biden administration is out now saying it. So where are the cultural institutions calling for his impeachment? Well, we are one of them. And we hope that you also call for Joe Biden's impeachment. You have a lot of power over your elected official demand that this be investigated. This is a perfect impeachable offense. This is the abuse and obstruction via the executive branch of a foreign relationship that puts in total peril. The American dollar hegemony and the petrile dollar and this is what this administration wants ultimately they want the destruction of this country. They want to destroy the things that should be preennial right that should keep America strong forever that should be outside of the bounds of their Marxist capacity to destroy but they're going at it anyway. The relationship with Saudi Arabia is much bigger and this is much more important to the future of your kids in the future of this entire global prosperity world that is quickly collapsing and turning to dust and ashes in our hands. Joe Biden cannot be allowed to continue on the suicide mission to destroy America.",subjective,political corruption

And even after the complaint was deemed credible and later corroborated, Republicans sought to undermine the whistleblower. Now, Republicans have rediscovered their love for whistleblowers under the Biden administration, even if those claims are unverified. I'm James Rieger, and this is the flip. In 2019, Rand Paul was one of the most outspoken Republicans, calling for the unmasking of the whistleblower. We also now know the name of the whistleblower. To the media, do your job and print his name. Now, Paul's changed his tune amid multiple Republican investigations into President Biden. The whistleblowers are incredibly important, and we should hear from them. Jim Jordan repeatedly questioned the Trump whistleblower's credibility in 2019. All based on anonymous whistleblower with no first hand knowledge as a vice against the president. Now, Jordan is credibly citing an anonymous FBI source to accuse Biden of corruption. The confidential human source is telling the foreign national he says, hey, you might want to stay away from the Biden's or shady folks. Despite being a founding member of the Senate whistleblower protection caucus, Ron Johnson called for outing the Trump whistleblower in 2019. Is it reasonable for an anonymous informant to remain anonymous? That's not a reasonable expectation on the part of whistleblowers. They ought to realize that for the level of those charges. Now, Johnson is joined other Republicans in touting the anonymous Biden FBI source. We need more whistleblowers. We are seeing corruption at the highest level of so many different government agencies. Republicans have yet to provide any other corroborating details for the anonymous FBI tip.

Learn to think like a lawyer for free for two months by clicking on the link in the description. Hey, Legal Eagles, it's time to think like a lawyer, because the president could use some good advice unlike the bad legal advice he seems to be getting at the moment. Today, we're going to discuss one of the newest scandals to rock the White House, the allegations of bribery and potential abuse of power by President Trump in exchange for getting dirt on presidential candidate Joe Biden. All hell seems to be breaking loose here in Washington, and although you could probably say that on any given day, this time it seems to be a little different because of one thing. House Democrats have announced that they are formally opening an inquiry into the impeachment of the president of the United States. This doesn't happen every day. To understand how we got here, you need to know the facts about Donald Trump's conversation with the president of Ukraine, a mysterious high-level whistleblower, the many faces of Rudy Giuliani, and what all that has to do with Joe Biden's son. So, to take a step back, Ukraine is a country in Eastern Europe that was formally a part of the Soviet Union. The country currently has a rocky relationship with Russia because Russian troops have invaded part of Ukraine's territory, the Crimea, back in 2014. Ukrainian citizens protested Russian involvement in their government, ousting President Viktor Yanukovych for conspiring with Russia. Now, the United States and most of the world condemned Russia and warned it against further interference in Ukrainian sovereignty. Later that same year, then Vice President Biden went to Ukraine to deliver U.S. aid. Now, fast forward a few years, in July of 2019, the Washington Post reported that a high-ranking intelligence official had filed a whistleblower complaint about promises that President Trump had made during communication and interaction with a foreign leader. Several news organizations reported that this whistleblower complaint involved President Trump promising aid to Ukraine if they dug up some dirt on Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son. Trump himself confirmed part of the story. Hunter Biden was a member of the board of a company called Berezma Holdings, the largest gas company in Ukraine. That company was known for having some ties to former President of Ukraine, Viktor Viennikoviƒá. Hunter Biden remained a board member of Berezma until 2019. So, what is the deal with this intelligence community whistleblower? Well, I probably don't need to tell you that it is incredibly unusual for a member of the intelligence community to, number one, file a whistleblower complaint. There are strict guidelines that one must follow in order to blow the whistle on the intelligence community. And it is almost unheard of that a whistleblower would blow the whistle on the President of the United States. That just has never happened before. And on September 9th, intelligence community general inspector or the ICIG, Michael Ackinson informed representatives Adam Schiff and Devon Nunez, who were on the House Intelligence Committee, that he had forwarded a whistleblower report to acting director of National Intelligence Joseph McGuire. A whistleblower is a person who exposes information that he or she believes is illegal or unethical. Governmental whistleblowers are not unusual, but a whistleblower at this level of the government in the intelligence community, making an allegation of the President absolutely is incredibly unusual. Inspector Ackinson determined that the report was, quote, an urgent concern, end quote, and quote, credible. Urgent and credible are two statutory requirements that require the ICIG to forward the complaint to Congress. Ackinson's ruling immediately made this a very serious allegation that Congress wanted to review. However, acting director of National Intelligence McGuire stepped in to claim that the complaint was not required to be released to Congress. Now remember this fact about acting DNI McGuire as we'll come back to it later. This fact could be the first indication of a cover-up by the White House and the Department of Justice. At the time of this video, we don't have all of the facts, we don't have the entire ICIG complaint, but news reports are indicating that President Trump may have threatened to withhold $400 million in military aid to Ukraine if it did not investigate Hunter Biden among other things. The Trump administration had criticized the Obama administration for not providing lethal foreign aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. So earlier this year, Congress appropriated almost $400 million in military aid, $250 million in explicit military aid and $150 million going through the State Department, that can be used for lethal force by the Ukrainians to buy military goods from the Americans. The argument, of course, being that Ukraine needs that military aid to help fight against Russia in Crimea and was approved by the Pentagon and Congress. However, for months, President Trump froze that military aid. Some reports indicate that government employees were instructed to obfuscate or lie to Congress about the reason for why that money was frozen. It's not necessarily unusual to freeze this kind of military aid, but under these circumstances it appears to be highly unusual and we'll get to why in just a moment. Although there is much speculation over the contents of the whistleblower report, President Trump and his personal lawyer and advisor Rudy Giuliani started confirming aspects of this particular story just days after it was broken. President Trump spoke with new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by telephone on July 25th, just days after Robert Mueller had testified in Congress. When President Trump allegedly mentioned his desire to have Biden investigated up to eight times. According to Trump, he summarizes phone call saying, We had a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption, picking place, was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden has done, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine. Ukraine's got a lot of problems. President Trump described the phone call as, quote, perfect. It's very important to talk about corruption. If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt? So it's very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption. So President Trump agrees that he spoke about alleged corruption by the Biden's, and that he also was reluctant to give money to Ukraine because he says the country is corrupt. A potential flaw with this argument is that the United States gives military aid to many different countries, not the least of which is Saudi Arabia, but the President does not seem to be doing any kind of corruption analysis with respect to those other countries. This may be specifically geared towards Ukraine and these unusual circumstances. The President Trump wasn't done yet. Speaking a few days later at the United Nations, President Trump said, Joe Biden and his son are corrupt. All right, but the fake news doesn't want to report it because they're Democrats. If that ever happened, if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, then beginning the electric chair by right now. So what is it that President Trump alleges the Biden's did? President Trump alleges that Joe Biden used American financial aid to pressure the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor in 2016. The theory is that the prosecutor, Victor Shokin, was investigating Ukraine's largest gas company, Berizma. Although President Trump has been vague about what the Biden's did that deserved the so-called electric chair, the corruption allegations have been investigated and dismissed. Shokin was accused of being soft on corruption. The United States was not alone in calling for his ouster. Other Western nations in the entire European Union also called on Ukraine to remove him. And the Ukrainian parliament eventually voted to remove Shokin. According to Bloomberg News, which did an extensive report on the matter in 2019, the Berizma investigation had already been dead for about a year by the time the vice president Biden called for Shokin to be sacked. And there is no indication that Hunter Biden personally was being investigated for corruption. The former Ukrainian prosecutor general told Bloomberg that he found no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden. But President Trump would not let that debunked story die, stating Biden, quote, said, I'm not going to give billions of dollars to Ukraine unless they remove this prosecutor. And they removed the prosecutor supposedly in one hour. And the prosecutor was prosecuting the company of the son and the son. He just shouldn't have said that. Now as far as my conversation, it was perfect. It was a perfect conversation. As you may be aware, Joe Biden has consistently been the Democratic front runner against President Trump in the 2020 presidential election and has consistently led Donald Trump in head-to-head polls. President Trump and Rudy Giuliani have already confirmed many aspects, although not all of the aspects of this particular story. So what's going up with Rudy Giuliani, you may ask. Well, Rudy Giuliani is one of the president's personal lawyers. He has no formal job with the US government, but allegedly has been acting as a messenger for President Trump with Ukraine. In another one of Mr. Giuliani's legendary TV appearances, Giuliani has admitted that he spent several months pressuring Ukraine for dirt on the Biden's, appearing on Chris Cuomo's CNN program. Giuliani said, I have the only thing I asked about Joe Biden is to get to the bottom of how it was that Wood Sanko, who was appointed, dismissed the case against Antelope. So you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden? Of course I did. So we already know that Giuliani met with Ukrainian officials in May and August of this year. The August meeting was just a week after President Trump froze all of the military aid that Congress and the Pentagon had appropriated for Ukraine. Giuliani said that during the August meeting, a Ukrainian official promised to, quote, get to the bottom, end quote, of the Biden situation. The Wall Street Journal reported that this was part of an ongoing effort by President Trump to have the Ukrainians work with Giuliani to find some dirt on the Biden's in exchange for the promised aid. Now, on its face, there are major problems with Giuliani's role in all of this. Giuliani is not a member of the US government and should not be conducting US foreign policy.",subjective,political scandal

The bride is to pledge or withhold military assistance. The idea that somebody would withhold in badly needed weaponry for political reasons at home is beyond the tale. Now of course what was Donald Trump asking them to look into? He was asking them to look into situations like this where Joe Biden openly stated on camera that he used American taxpayer dollars in order to protect his son hunter from being investigated by Ukrainian special prosecutor. Here is Joe Biden on tape using a billion dollar blackmail against the government of Ukraine and he was proud of it. He got applauded for it. It's a son of a bitch. They fired the prosecutor go. I said no I said I'm not going to give you the billion dollars. They said you have no authority you're not the president. The president said I said call him. I said I'm telling you not get the billion dollars. I said you're not getting the billion dollars. I'm going to be leaving here and I think it was about six hours. I look at it and I said we even six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired you're not getting the money. Well son of a bitch. He fired. They put in place someone who was solid. I didn't know that this is all because of Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine. Hunter Biden demanded that Joe Biden do this and Joe Biden do tofully went down and protected his crack as he always does. So the question is how long will Joe Biden remain protected? This is the clearest example in my lifetime. By the way, Donald Trump didn't withhold any spending or funding from Ukraine. Donald Trump didn't withhold anything. Ukraine decided not to open up an investigation into the Biden's hilarious. And now of course we see what's happening at that region of the world. Of course the calamity and the collapse all stemming obviously from horrible and poor political decisions would have been a lot smarter to stick with the president to brought you peace. But now ladies and gentlemen the Biden's I think and quite frankly the global football have always wanted destruction for Ukraine. It's always been a bad route to take to be in league with people who are warmongers. Okay. This is why Tulsi Gabbard left the Democratic Party this week warmongers. But hey, I didn't make the decisions. You probably should have investigated Joe Biden. If someone's get announced that he was going to investigate Joe Biden and went after and prosecuted Hunter Biden and his son. Would we be in the world we're living in today? But he chose to side with the Biden's so whatever. Okay. Listen, we're sitting here. It's looking at this situation saying this is the clearest cut could pro quo we've ever seen in our life. You give me this and I'll give you that. Joe Biden administration is out now saying it. So where are the cultural institutions calling for his impeachment? Well, we are one of them. And we hope that you also call for Joe Biden's impeachment. You have a lot of power over your elected official demand that this be investigated. This is a perfect impeachable offense. This is the abuse and obstruction via the executive branch of a foreign relationship that puts in total peril. The American dollar hegemony and the petrile dollar and this is what this administration wants ultimately they want the destruction of this country. They want to destroy the things that should be preennial right that should keep America strong forever that should be outside of the bounds of their Marxist capacity to destroy but they're going at it anyway.

These discriminatory obstacles fall hardest on black, indigenous, and other people of color, people with disabilities, young people, undocumented people, people in rural communities, and those having difficulty making ends meet.

When Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison mentioned a maximum wage during a meeting with the Congressional Progressive Caucus in 2018, one reporter assumed he must have been making a joke. Whoever heard of such a thing, when asked about his joke, Ellison fired back that he was not joking at all. Ellison described the income disparity between McDonald's workers trying to get $15 an hour and the CEO who makes approximately $9,000 an hour. If we say you're incalculable greed is not acceptable, we get called communists. Why not call CEOs what they are, which is ever-ishest and greedy? There seems to be a little recognition that it is disgustingly greedy for the US ultra-rich to take so much when millions of Americans don't make nearly enough. For example, returning to the minimum wage for contrast, one 2018 study showed that even working full-time at the US minimum wage, no worker would be able to afford rent in an average priced one-bedroom home in any state in the union. According to researchers, a minimum wage worker would need to work 99 hours per week for all 52 weeks of the year or approximately 2.5 full-time jobs to afford a one-bedroom home at the National Average Fair Market Rent. It is the poverty of the minimum wage workers that makes the inflated compensation of US CEOs possible. It would take a typical McDonald's employee more than 3,000 years to earn with the CEO got paid just in 2017. But still, the idea of a maximum wage is so absurd, it must be a joke! It turns out that the idea of a maximum wage hasn't always been such a hilarious notion. In fact, the US almost got a maximum wage during World War II. On April 27, 1942, President Roosevelt asked the Congress to institute a maximum wage because of the war effort. He said, no American citizen ought to have a net income after he paid his taxes of more than 25,000 a year, the equivalent of about 486,000 in 2023. The way it would have worked is that a 100% war super tax would have taxed away all income above a certain threshold. The official proposal landed on 40,000 for individuals and 110,000 for married couples. It turns out that even during World War II, this idea was abridged too far, yet by wars and top income tax rates had climbed 94%. Here, slight post-war dip-top income tax rates for the rich stayed above 90% through the Republican Eisenhower administration and didn't drop until rich man president John F. Kennedy cut them to 77%. Today's top income tax rates for the rich max out at 37%. As author Sam Pitsigatti points out, if it's possible for us to understand the concept of a wage floor, a minimum amount of compensation for people to survive on, why not a ceiling? The thing is, this hilarious concept of a maximum wage or even tax rates of about 90% as was once brought the accepted or 70% would be really good for the American economy. You don't have to take my word for it, just look at what happened when the US had those very high tax rates on the rich. It was that period of time that conservatives loved to idealize, a single wage earner, a new car every couple of years, broad-based prosperity. It was called the Golden Age of Capitalism, the post-war period encompassing the 1950s to the 1970s. It was also a period of huge tax rates on the rich and the highest percentage of union membership in our nation's history. There was a rationale for high tax rates on the rich back then. Matthew Iglesias points out that having 90% tax rates meant that companies had to pay executives a thousand dollars for every 100 in increased pay. Rather than send 900 dollars to the tax man, there was greater incentive to spread that money around with smaller raises for less extravagantly paid workers. Making more money to more people rather than the rich stimulated the economy. This is a big part of the reason that growth rates and productivity rose with wages during that period. But the policies that made those things possible were abandoned a long time ago. Ronald Reagan and his predecessor, Jimmy Carter, blew up redistributive policies that had been around since the New Deal by slashing taxes on the rich, a trend that continues all the way to today. The idea behind the first Reagan tax cuts was that they were supposed to stimulate growth. Instead of stimulating growth, however, cutting taxes on the rich has only choked growth off to even lower levels than the US economy had before Reagan was elected. Tax cuts for the rich have made things worse. Bribing the rich has failed to increase growth for 40 years, yet both the major parties that make up the US political class stubbornly refuse to do anything different. Instead in truly insane fashion, they continue to cut taxes on the rich, in the supposed hope that doing the same thing, which also happens to be the politically expedient thing, will somehow achieve a different result. It never will. Here's what you need to know. Inequality is a political choice. There is no law of nature that says CEOs and executives need to make 400 times with the rest of their workforce makes. There is no principle in economics that says the wealthiest handful at the top should hold more wealth than the poorest half of all Americans. America's vast economic inequality has been brought to us purposefully through decades of choices and changes in American law. We live in the world that rich people want because they have bought and paid for it. But it's even more important for you to know that what has been done can also be undone. This inequality is not a law of nature. It can be reversed. We don't have to accept the status quo. I don't think a maximum wage is a hilarious joke. Taxing the rich is good for our economy. It makes sense. There's a reason that we used to do it aggressively in this country. We should do it again. Please like, follow, favorite, comment, and subscribe to my free subs deck.

Thank you so much to all of our colleagues here who have made such incredible and forceful arguments. I want to reiterate one point. The reason why anyone is asking anyone on this stage about what we would vote for is because Kevin McCarthy needs our votes. Because Kevin McCarthy doesn't have the votes. Because Kevin McCarthy is going to the White House without a majority of his caucus. He does not have what is necessary to negotiate. And for any question about what anybody would settle for, he has responsibility to concede. So if he wants any democratic support, he has to come to the table. And we have seen him over and over again say that he will not negotiate, that they are engaged in hostage-taking, not negotiation, extortion, not conversation. And that is not something we can establish. It is not something we can reinforce in this country. The proposal that we see on this table right now, that Kevin McCarthy and Republican caucus have put down has been an absolute rejection of the same reckless tax cuts that were passed in 2017, that we said at the time would explode the debt ratio that would explode the deficit. And now, several years later, we are in this scenario. And instead of them recognizing the error of their ways, they want to protect tax cuts on yachts and private jets and make single moms pay for it. And that's where we say no. That's where we say American people did not elect house progressives so that we can lay back while people's food benefits are cut. We're here to fight for working families. And so this is the last pocket to ask, what are we going to give up in terms of people's food, in terms of people's health care, in terms of veterans? And the time is now to ask the Republican caucus why they are valuing billionaires over veterans and single mothers. This is shameful. We can put an end to it.

Pramaya Jayapal's office put out a little statement, sort of, you know, like walking it back. We stand firmly with Ukraine. And then, just before the show, we now have a full on backpedaling. Here's how Glenn Greenwald features this. He says, holy shit, the humiliation of representative Jayapal in the House Progress of Caucus just got worse even when it appeared it couldn't.

I'm going to read to you. Why it's not maybe a hold on. There we go. There we go. It grew on me. There we go. So yes, this is the Congressional Progressive Caucus chair statement on the Ukraine letter. Representative Pramaya Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, issued the following statement in a letter sent regarding Ukraine. The Congressional Progressive Caucus hereby withdraws its recent letter to the White House regarding Ukraine. The letter was drafted several months ago. But unfortunately, it was released by staff members without vetting. So we're going to pick that apart in a second, right? Because I don't, I think that's total bullshit, don't you? As chair of the caucus, I accept responsibility for this. Because of the timing, our message is being conflated by some as being equivalent to the recent statement by Republican leader McCarthy threatening to end aid to Ukraine if Republicans take over. The proximity of these statements created the unfortunate appearance. The Democrats who have strongly and unanimously supported and voted for every package of military strategic and economic assistance to the Ukrainian people are somehow aligned with Republicans, who seek to pull the plug on American support for Zelensky and the Ukrainian forces.

You can recall what Democrats said back in the time when and the details are thus Donald Trump simply asked Ukraine and the president of Ukraine to look in to the Biden family corruption. A series of events that looks like extortion withholding aid to an ally and then quote-unquote asking for a favor to essentially benefit yourself politically. The bride is to pledge or withhold military assistance. The idea that somebody would withhold in badly needed weaponry for political reasons at home is beyond the tale. Now of course what was Donald Trump asking them to look into? He was asking them to look into situations like this where Joe Biden openly stated on camera that he used American taxpayer dollars in order to protect his son hunter from being investigated by Ukrainian special prosecutor. Here is Joe Biden on tape using a billion dollar blackmail against the government of Ukraine and he was proud of it. He got applauded for it. It's a son of a bitch. They fired the prosecutor go. I said no I said I'm not going to give you the billion dollars. They said you have no authority you're not the president. The president said I said call him. I said I'm telling you not get the billion dollars. I said you're not getting the billion dollars. I'm going to be leaving here and I think it was about six hours. I look at it and I said we even six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired you're not getting the money. Well son of a bitch. He fired. They put in place someone who was solid. I didn't know that this is all because of Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine. Hunter Biden demanded that Joe Biden do this and Joe Biden do tofully went down and protected his crack as he always does. So the question is how long will Joe Biden remain protected? This is the clearest example in my lifetime. By the way, Donald Trump didn't withhold any spending or funding from Ukraine. Donald Trump didn't withhold anything. Ukraine decided not to open up an investigation into the Biden's hilarious. And now of course we see what's happening at that region of the world. Of course the calamity and the collapse all stemming obviously from horrible and poor political decisions would have been a lot smarter to stick with the president to brought you peace.

It's always been a bad route to take to be in league with people who are warmongers. Okay. This is why Tulsi Gabbard left the Democratic Party this week warmongers. But hey, I didn't make the decisions. You probably should have investigated Joe Biden.

People can legally be turned away from restaurants, denied home loans or rental properties, or even denied medical care by health care providers. This is why we need the equality act. The equality act would modernize federal civil rights laws and prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. This means in key aspects of life, including education, credit, employment, public spaces, housing, and even more. The US House of Representatives passed the equality act earlier this year in a bipartisan fashion. But the Senate has still not even taken up the bill.

However, another case, 1992's Planned Parenthood versus Casey, allowed states to pass a range of limitations and restrictions. These discriminatory obstacles fall hardest on black, indigenous, and other people of color, people with disabilities, young people, undocumented people, people in rural communities, and those having difficulty making ends meet. As abortion restrictions have expanded in scope, states that impose abortion restrictions and made the substantial healthcare inaccessible have had much higher rates of maternal and infant mortality, which has been especially pronounced for black women. With Roe being overturned, 26 states and three territories are expected to immediately ban or move to enact legislation that would be an abortion.

When Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison mentioned a maximum wage during a meeting with the Congressional Progressive Caucus in 2018, one reporter assumed he must have been making a joke. Whoever heard of such a thing, when asked about his joke, Ellison fired back that he was not joking at all. Ellison described the income disparity between McDonald's workers trying to get $15 an hour and the CEO who makes approximately $9,000 an hour. If we say you're incalculable greed is not acceptable, we get called communists. Why not call CEOs what they are, which is ever-ishest and greedy? There seems to be a little recognition that it is disgustingly greedy for the US ultra-rich to take so much when millions of Americans don't make nearly enough. For example, returning to the minimum wage for contrast, one 2018 study showed that even working full-time at the US minimum wage, no worker would be able to afford rent in an average priced one-bedroom home in any state in the union. According to researchers, a minimum wage worker would need to work 99 hours per week for all 52 weeks of the year or approximately 2.5 full-time jobs to afford a one-bedroom home at the National Average Fair Market Rent. It is the poverty of the minimum wage workers that makes the inflated compensation of US CEOs possible. It would take a typical McDonald's employee more than 3,000 years to earn with the CEO got paid just in 2017. But still, the idea of a maximum wage is so absurd, it must be a joke! It turns out that the idea of a maximum wage hasn't always been such a hilarious notion. In fact, the US almost got a maximum wage during World War II. On April 27, 1942, President Roosevelt asked the Congress to institute a maximum wage because of the war effort. He said, no American citizen ought to have a net income after he paid his taxes of more than 25,000 a year, the equivalent of about 486,000 in 2023. The way it would have worked is that a 100% war super tax would have taxed away all income above a certain threshold. The official proposal landed on 40,000 for individuals and 110,000 for married couples. It turns out that even during World War II, this idea was abridged too far, yet by wars and top income tax rates had climbed 94%. Here, slight post-war dip-top income tax rates for the rich stayed above 90% through the Republican Eisenhower administration and didn't drop until rich man president John F. Kennedy cut them to 77%. Today's top income tax rates for the rich max out at 37%. As author Sam Pitsigatti points out, if it's possible for us to understand the concept of a wage floor, a minimum amount of compensation for people to survive on, why not a ceiling? The thing is, this hilarious concept of a maximum wage or even tax rates of about 90% as was once brought the accepted or 70% would be really good for the American economy. You don't have to take my word for it, just look at what happened when the US had those very high tax rates on the rich. It was that period of time that conservatives loved to idealize, a single wage earner, a new car every couple of years, broad-based prosperity. It was called the Golden Age of Capitalism, the post-war period encompassing the 1950s to the 1970s. It was also a period of huge tax rates on the rich and the highest percentage of union membership in our nation's history. There was a rationale for high tax rates on the rich back then. Matthew Iglesias points out that having 90% tax rates meant that companies had to pay executives a thousand dollars for every 100 in increased pay. Rather than send 900 dollars to the tax man, there was greater incentive to spread that money around with smaller raises for less extravagantly paid workers. Making more money to more people rather than the rich stimulated the economy. This is a big part of the reason that growth rates and productivity rose with wages during that period. But the policies that made those things possible were abandoned a long time ago. Ronald Reagan and his predecessor, Jimmy Carter, blew up redistributive policies that had been around since the New Deal by slashing taxes on the rich, a trend that continues all the way to today. The idea behind the first Reagan tax cuts was that they were supposed to stimulate growth. Instead of stimulating growth, however, cutting taxes on the rich has only choked growth off to even lower levels than the US economy had before Reagan was elected. Tax cuts for the rich have made things worse. Bribing the rich has failed to increase growth for 40 years, yet both the major parties that make up the US political class stubbornly refuse to do anything different. Instead in truly insane fashion, they continue to cut taxes on the rich, in the supposed hope that doing the same thing, which also happens to be the politically expedient thing, will somehow achieve a different result. It never will. Here's what you need to know. Inequality is a political choice. There is no law of nature that says CEOs and executives need to make 400 times with the rest of their workforce makes. There is no principle in economics that says the wealthiest handful at the top should hold more wealth than the poorest half of all Americans. America's vast economic inequality has been brought to us purposefully through decades of choices and changes in American law. We live in the world that rich people want because they have bought and paid for it. But it's even more important for you to know that what has been done can also be undone. This inequality is not a law of nature. It can be reversed. We don't have to accept the status quo. I don't think a maximum wage is a hilarious joke. Taxing the rich is good for our economy. It makes sense. There's a reason that we used to do it aggressively in this country. We should do it again. Please like, follow, favorite, comment, and subscribe to my free subs deck.

Thank you so much to all of our colleagues here who have made such incredible and forceful arguments. I want to reiterate one point. The reason why anyone is asking anyone on this stage about what we would vote for is because Kevin McCarthy needs our votes. Because Kevin McCarthy doesn't have the votes. Because Kevin McCarthy is going to the White House without a majority of his caucus. He does not have what is necessary to negotiate. And for any question about what anybody would settle for, he has responsibility to concede. So if he wants any democratic support, he has to come to the table. And we have seen him over and over again say that he will not negotiate, that they are engaged in hostage-taking, not negotiation, extortion, not conversation. And that is not something we can establish. It is not something we can reinforce in this country. The proposal that we see on this table right now, that Kevin McCarthy and Republican caucus have put down has been an absolute rejection of the same reckless tax cuts that were passed in 2017, that we said at the time would explode the debt ratio that would explode the deficit. And now, several years later, we are in this scenario. And instead of them recognizing the error of their ways, they want to protect tax cuts on yachts and private jets and make single moms pay for it. And that's where we say no. That's where we say American people did not elect house progressives so that we can lay back while people's food benefits are cut. We're here to fight for working families. And so this is the last pocket to ask, what are we going to give up in terms of people's food, in terms of people's health care, in terms of veterans? And the time is now to ask the Republican caucus why they are valuing billionaires over veterans and single mothers. This is shameful. We can put an end to it. And it only takes five of the 18 Republicans that are in Biden-carried seats.",subjective,government spending

Pramaya Jayapal's office put out a little statement, sort of, you know, like walking it back. We stand firmly with Ukraine. And then, just before the show, we now have a full on backpedaling. Here's how Glenn Greenwald features this. He says, holy shit, the humiliation of representative Jayapal in the House Progress of Caucus just got worse even when it appeared it couldn't. Her degrading reversal of their Ukraine letter after one day wasn't enough. Now they're formally, formally retracting it and blaming staff members. That's ridiculous. Yeah.

Yes. That's true. Or they were pressured into it by their, you know, kind of kid junior lackeys. I mean, it was staff members fall. I mean, it's unbelievable. And so let me just read to you. This is the letter that was now the retraction letter. And if I can pull this now, I can't, I'll just read it to you because I can't get it up here closer. But this is the actual retraction letter. I'm going to read to you. Why it's not maybe a hold on. There we go. There we go. It grew on me. There we go. So yes, this is the Congressional Progressive Caucus chair statement on the Ukraine letter. Representative Pramaya Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, issued the following statement in a letter sent regarding Ukraine. The Congressional Progressive Caucus hereby withdraws its recent letter to the White House regarding Ukraine. The letter was drafted several months ago. But unfortunately, it was released by staff members without vetting. So we're going to pick that apart in a second, right? Because I don't, I think that's total bullshit, don't you? As chair of the caucus, I accept responsibility for this. Because of the timing, our message is being conflated by some as being equivalent to the recent statement by Republican leader McCarthy threatening to end aid to Ukraine if Republicans take over. The proximity of these statements created the unfortunate appearance. The Democrats who have strongly and unanimously supported and voted for every package of military strategic and economic assistance to the Ukrainian people are somehow aligned with Republicans, who seek to pull the plug on American support for Zelensky and the Ukrainian forces.

And the president even came to give an address which has since gone pretty viral but we'll talk about that another time. But stay to get ready with me and learn more about the Congressional Black Caucus aka the CBC. So the CBC was established in 1971 shortly after the huge legislative wins of the Civil Rights Movement. It's founding members include Shirley Chizoum who was the first Black woman elected to Congress and who introduced more than 50 pieces of legislation including some to end the Vietnam War. It also included Ralph Metcalf who was an Olympic gold medalist and who introduced the Congressional resolution that officially established Black History Month. Right now in the 118th Congress, the CBC has 58 members more than ever before. And while it's high Republican members in the past, the current makeup of the CBC is entirely Democrat. GOP members like Trump supporter representative Byron Donalds have been refused entry while other Black Republicans like Senator Tim Scott have the client invitation. But according to the caucus, the CBC aims to be nonpartisan and they want to work across the aisle and policy issues. Right now, the CBC is most significantly credited with pushing voting rights legislation and currently they're prioritizing passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to modernizing strength in the Voting Rights Act of 1965. They've also pushed for education investment especially in HBCUs as well as pushed for federal holidays like MLK Day and June 10th. Internally though, CBC members have various policy priorities and agendas from Congressman Horseford who is pushing for more diverse military to Congresswoman Cory Bush who have personally worked with the push for federal reparations. And just because the CBC is called the Congressional Black Caucus doesn't necessarily mean that all Black Americans feel represented by every single piece of legislation they've put forward. For example, I actually wrote my senior thesis in college on how in the past, the CBC almost universally supported the infamous 1994 crime bill which was a part of the devastating war on crime. How did you feel about the CBC and how do you feel about this fit? Let me know in the comments and follow for more.",subjective,civil rights

That also came against the backdrop of Congressman Dean Phillips announcing he is running against President Biden. Are you concerned that in a general election, both of these things, could weaken President Biden's chances? Well, let me say, Kristen, that I have been one of President Biden's biggest supporters. I have been proud to be a partner as he has been courageous and strong on the domestic front. He has really called out the injustices for average working Americans across this country. But is he going to be weakened, conversely, with new age-up workers? Well, I feel like I need to say this because what I think is that the President needs to be just as courageous on this issue so that we keep the unity within our country for the support of the incredible things he has done. He is, I think, going to be challenged to explain an issue of this moral significance to people. The American people are actually quite far away from where the President and even Congress, the majority of Congress, has been on Israel and Gaza. They support the right for Israel to defend itself, to exist, but they do not support a war crime exchanged for another war crime. And I think the President has to be careful about that. And I would call him, because I know him well. I've had breakfast with him. I've had the honor of working with him. I would call him to bring us to a higher place, to let the American people, to really call to the American people on a moral issue of this nature.

Rightly called out the attacks on the power infrastructure, the refusal to provide food and water and fuel to the Ukrainians.

Black banks have never been invested in in the way that, let's say, the Bank of Italy was invested in, that now has become Bank of America one of our largest banks. You've had Jim Crow, Black laws, KKK, mass incarceration. You've had globalization where we, with the race to the bottom, chasing low-cost labor all over the world, taking industrial jobs out of the black communities. You know what they brought back in? Cops and drugs and the numbers game. You gave us an illegal economy and cops, but never repaired the harm that you have caused, which is why black mostly gun trafficking is trafficking the black and brown communities, and black and brown people are killing each other with it. So when I talk about dealing with the racial poverty, I'm talking about reparations, repairing the historic harm, investing in schools equitably. Right now, if you live in a wealthy community, you'll get more money for your school than you live in the poor community. And the poor community is only poor, because they were red-lined by the United States government via the GI bill. Come on now. Now, let me address a couple of your things. The first thing you said is about income inequality. Listen, of course, incomes are not equal, because everybody has different levels of talent, ability. People have started in different parts in life. We both acknowledge that. Yes. I will never sit here and say, but, oh, no. No, come on. Let me tell you what I'm saying.

These discriminatory obstacles fall hardest on black, indigenous, and other people of color, people with disabilities, young people, undocumented people, people in rural communities, and those having difficulty making ends meet.

When Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison mentioned a maximum wage during a meeting with the Congressional Progressive Caucus in 2018, one reporter assumed he must have been making a joke. Whoever heard of such a thing, when asked about his joke, Ellison fired back that he was not joking at all. Ellison described the income disparity between McDonald's workers trying to get $15 an hour and the CEO who makes approximately $9,000 an hour. If we say you're incalculable greed is not acceptable, we get called communists. Why not call CEOs what they are, which is ever-ishest and greedy? There seems to be a little recognition that it is disgustingly greedy for the US ultra-rich to take so much when millions of Americans don't make nearly enough. For example, returning to the minimum wage for contrast, one 2018 study showed that even working full-time at the US minimum wage, no worker would be able to afford rent in an average priced one-bedroom home in any state in the union. According to researchers, a minimum wage worker would need to work 99 hours per week for all 52 weeks of the year or approximately 2.5 full-time jobs to afford a one-bedroom home at the National Average Fair Market Rent. It is the poverty of the minimum wage workers that makes the inflated compensation of US CEOs possible. It would take a typical McDonald's employee more than 3,000 years to earn with the CEO got paid just in 2017. But still, the idea of a maximum wage is so absurd, it must be a joke! It turns out that the idea of a maximum wage hasn't always been such a hilarious notion. In fact, the US almost got a maximum wage during World War II. On April 27, 1942, President Roosevelt asked the Congress to institute a maximum wage because of the war effort. He said, no American citizen ought to have a net income after he paid his taxes of more than 25,000 a year, the equivalent of about 486,000 in 2023. The way it would have worked is that a 100% war super tax would have taxed away all income above a certain threshold. The official proposal landed on 40,000 for individuals and 110,000 for married couples. It turns out that even during World War II, this idea was abridged too far, yet by wars and top income tax rates had climbed 94%. Here, slight post-war dip-top income tax rates for the rich stayed above 90% through the Republican Eisenhower administration and didn't drop until rich man president John F. Kennedy cut them to 77%. Today's top income tax rates for the rich max out at 37%. As author Sam Pitsigatti points out, if it's possible for us to understand the concept of a wage floor, a minimum amount of compensation for people to survive on, why not a ceiling? The thing is, this hilarious concept of a maximum wage or even tax rates of about 90% as was once brought the accepted or 70% would be really good for the American economy. You don't have to take my word for it, just look at what happened when the US had those very high tax rates on the rich. It was that period of time that conservatives loved to idealize, a single wage earner, a new car every couple of years, broad-based prosperity. It was called the Golden Age of Capitalism, the post-war period encompassing the 1950s to the 1970s. It was also a period of huge tax rates on the rich and the highest percentage of union membership in our nation's history. There was a rationale for high tax rates on the rich back then. Matthew Iglesias points out that having 90% tax rates meant that companies had to pay executives a thousand dollars for every 100 in increased pay. Rather than send 900 dollars to the tax man, there was greater incentive to spread that money around with smaller raises for less extravagantly paid workers. Making more money to more people rather than the rich stimulated the economy. This is a big part of the reason that growth rates and productivity rose with wages during that period. But the policies that made those things possible were abandoned a long time ago. Ronald Reagan and his predecessor, Jimmy Carter, blew up redistributive policies that had been around since the New Deal by slashing taxes on the rich, a trend that continues all the way to today. The idea behind the first Reagan tax cuts was that they were supposed to stimulate growth. Instead of stimulating growth, however, cutting taxes on the rich has only choked growth off to even lower levels than the US economy had before Reagan was elected. Tax cuts for the rich have made things worse. Bribing the rich has failed to increase growth for 40 years, yet both the major parties that make up the US political class stubbornly refuse to do anything different. Instead in truly insane fashion, they continue to cut taxes on the rich, in the supposed hope that doing the same thing, which also happens to be the politically expedient thing, will somehow achieve a different result. It never will. Here's what you need to know. Inequality is a political choice. There is no law of nature that says CEOs and executives need to make 400 times with the rest of their workforce makes. There is no principle in economics that says the wealthiest handful at the top should hold more wealth than the poorest half of all Americans. America's vast economic inequality has been brought to us purposefully through decades of choices and changes in American law. We live in the world that rich people want because they have bought and paid for it. But it's even more important for you to know that what has been done can also be undone. This inequality is not a law of nature. It can be reversed. We don't have to accept the status quo. I don't think a maximum wage is a hilarious joke. Taxing the rich is good for our economy. It makes sense. There's a reason that we used to do it aggressively in this country. We should do it again. Please like, follow, favorite, comment, and subscribe to my free subs deck.

Thank you so much to all of our colleagues here who have made such incredible and forceful arguments. I want to reiterate one point. The reason why anyone is asking anyone on this stage about what we would vote for is because Kevin McCarthy needs our votes. Because Kevin McCarthy doesn't have the votes. Because Kevin McCarthy is going to the White House without a majority of his caucus. He does not have what is necessary to negotiate. And for any question about what anybody would settle for, he has responsibility to concede. So if he wants any democratic support, he has to come to the table. And we have seen him over and over again say that he will not negotiate, that they are engaged in hostage-taking, not negotiation, extortion, not conversation. And that is not something we can establish. It is not something we can reinforce in this country. The proposal that we see on this table right now, that Kevin McCarthy and Republican caucus have put down has been an absolute rejection of the same reckless tax cuts that were passed in 2017, that we said at the time would explode the debt ratio that would explode the deficit. And now, several years later, we are in this scenario. And instead of them recognizing the error of their ways, they want to protect tax cuts on yachts and private jets and make single moms pay for it. And that's where we say no. That's where we say American people did not elect house progressives so that we can lay back while people's food benefits are cut. We're here to fight for working families. And so this is the last pocket to ask, what are we going to give up in terms of people's food, in terms of people's health care, in terms of veterans? And the time is now to ask the Republican caucus why they are valuing billionaires over veterans and single mothers. This is shameful. We can put an end to it.

Representative Pramaya Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, issued the following statement in a letter sent regarding Ukraine. The Congressional Progressive Caucus hereby withdraws its recent letter to the White House regarding Ukraine. The letter was drafted several months ago. But unfortunately, it was released by staff members without vetting. So we're going to pick that apart in a second, right? Because I don't, I think that's total bullshit, don't you? As chair of the caucus, I accept responsibility for this. Because of the timing, our message is being conflated by some as being equivalent to the recent statement by Republican leader McCarthy threatening to end aid to Ukraine if Republicans take over. The proximity of these statements created the unfortunate appearance. The Democrats who have strongly and unanimously supported and voted for every package of military strategic and economic assistance to the Ukrainian people are somehow aligned with Republicans, who seek to pull the plug on American support for Zelensky and the Ukrainian forces.

Former President Donald Trump and his supporters refused to accept the outcome, alleging widespread voter fraud without providing substantial evidence. This baseless claim intensified the polarization in the country, leading to widespread mistrust in the democratic process and setting the stage for the events that unfolded on January 6. On January 6, as Congress gathered to certify the Electoral College results at the Capitol in Washington, DC, thousands of Trump supporters gathered for a rally near the White House. Trump, in a speech, continued to dispute the election results and urged his followers to march to the Capitol in protest. The situation quickly escalated into chaos, as a mob breached security barriers, stormed the Capitol building, vandalized offices, and clashed with law enforcement. The rioters disrupted the constitutional process and forced lawmakers to evacuate, delaying the certification of the election results. The violent attack resulted in multiple injuries, including law enforcement officers and civilians, and tragically led to the deaths of several individuals. The National Guard and additional law enforcement were deployed to restore order, eventually clearing the Capitol of rioters. The aftermath of the attack saw widespread condemnation from political leaders, both domestic and international, who denounced the assault on the heart of American democracy. The events of January 6 prompted increased security measures at the Capitol and raised concerns about the state of democracy and the need for unity in the United States. . #otd #ushistory #americanhistory #history #washingtondc #dc #republican #democrat #politics #january6 ",False,,histories.fyi,hiStories.fyi,,,,,,False,"Storming of the US Capitol (Jan, 2021)",2021,@histories.fyi_video_7321204538491407658.txt," This way, we're going to do it.

Just ahead, officers guarding the building are understaffed and ill-equipped for what's coming their way. You're the biggest! The building is more than two football fields in length.

You took a nose! Does that not mean a damn thing to you, does it? Metro Police will arrive within 15 minutes, but for reasons we'll explain later, the National Guard will arrive for over four hours. Meanwhile, more Capitol Police come to reinforce the line. It's the first time we see officers in riot here. Still, no BLM, Antifa, or the FBI, just a angry mob of Trump supporters who are now attacking the police officers. Yes, they are attacking the blue. And it's later reinforcements from the Metro Police arrive. A high ranking Metro officer immediately calls for more backup. Did you just go up to help make a line? They're pulling five pounds. They struggle to subjuge rioters who respond with their own chemical spray. And within 30 minutes, the police already have casualties. Multiple Capitol injuries in all caused by Donald Trump's supporters. Wow! The Capitol is now surrounded. The rioters haven't made it inside yet, but around the time that the mob on the east pushed forward, rioters on the west were making a pivotal move. Wow. This scaffolding was erected for the upcoming inauguration of Joe Biden. MAGA has no respect for law enforcement and it's very clear. Just look, no respect for the rule of law at all. And yes, once again, these are Trump supporters. It's an auto mayhem and it's about to get worse. The scene is being filmed from countless angles, allowing us to piece together moment by moment what comes next. The police shield is still to bash in a window. At 2.13 pm, the Capitol is breached. Michael Sparks, a Trump supporter from Kentucky, is the first person inside. A police officer seems unsure of what to do and backs off. Sparks is followed by proud boys and other far-right extremists. One carrying a Confederate flag, another armed with a baseball bat. When rioters break open the locked doors, hundreds more rushing. This is a critical moment. Officers must now defend the outside and inside of the building, stretching them even further. Yeah, no matter how many hours of footage, Mike Johnson or the man before him, Kevin McCarthy releases. It will not erase what we all just saw. Donald Trump instigated his supporters to get them to attack the United States Capitol. This is definitely Donald Trump's fault and the fault of all of the supporters that went along with this. So no more of this BLM Antifa or FBI nonsense. You can go watch this footage right here and see all the Trump flags. All right. Trump supporters! Get those knee pads and those elbow pads ready.

You're going to break it. Take the Capitol and make it happen. Take the Capitol and make it happen. The Capitol right now! We're going to be marching over to the Capitol building. Two hours before this, the proud boys were already heading for the Capitol. They're clearly spoiling for a fight with far left agitators like Antifa, who they believe are in DC. Where's Antifa? But there are moments that suggest that... Come on. Where is Antifa? And while we're at it, where's the FBI? Where is BLM? It looks to me like... That's a bunch of Trump supporters, right? He's joined by other well-known proud boys like Joe Biggs, an organizer from Florida, Dominic Pazola, a former Marine, and Billy Christman.

And the tone is becoming menacing. We're going to destroy the fucking Capitol! Fuck you, fuckers! You are safe! Just ahead, officers guarding the building are understaffed and ill-equipped for what's coming their way. You're the biggest! The building is more than two football fields in length. The barricades erected on the east side are defended by just a few dozen officers. The west side, facing Trump's rally, is even lighter. The fencing has been extended, and on the northwest approach only five officers stand guard. Around five also defend the southwest approach, a few more dot the lawn, and about a dozen officers are behind them. Hmm. Fans to storm the Capitol.

You took a nose! Does that not mean a damn thing to you, does it? Metro Police will arrive within 15 minutes, but for reasons we'll explain later, the National Guard will arrive for over four hours. Meanwhile, more Capitol Police come to reinforce the line. It's the first time we see officers in riot here. Still, no BLM, Antifa, or the FBI, just a angry mob of Trump supporters who are now attacking the police officers. Yes, they are attacking the blue. And it's later reinforcements from the Metro Police arrive. A high ranking Metro officer immediately calls for more backup. Did you just go up to help make a line? They're pulling five pounds. They struggle to subjuge rioters who respond with their own chemical spray. And within 30 minutes, the police already have casualties. Multiple Capitol injuries in all caused by Donald Trump's supporters. Wow! The Capitol is now surrounded. The rioters haven't made it inside yet, but around the time that the mob on the east pushed forward, rioters on the west were making a pivotal move. Wow. This scaffolding was erected for the upcoming inauguration of Joe Biden. MAGA has no respect for law enforcement and it's very clear. Just look, no respect for the rule of law at all. And yes, once again, these are Trump supporters. It's an auto mayhem and it's about to get worse. The scene is being filmed from countless angles, allowing us to piece together moment by moment what comes next. The police shield is still to bash in a window. At 2.13 pm, the Capitol is breached. Michael Sparks, a Trump supporter from Kentucky, is the first person inside. A police officer seems unsure of what to do and backs off. Sparks is followed by proud boys and other far-right extremists. One carrying a Confederate flag, another armed with a baseball bat. When rioters break open the locked doors, hundreds more rushing. This is a critical moment. Officers must now defend the outside and inside of the building, stretching them even further. Yeah, no matter how many hours of footage, Mike Johnson or the man before him, Kevin McCarthy releases. It will not erase what we all just saw. Donald Trump instigated his supporters to get them to attack the United States Capitol. This is definitely Donald Trump's fault and the fault of all of the supporters that went along with this. So no more of this BLM Antifa or FBI nonsense. You can go watch this footage right here and see all the Trump flags. All right. Trump supporters! Get those knee pads and those elbow pads ready.

Former President Donald Trump and his supporters refused to accept the outcome, alleging widespread voter fraud without providing substantial evidence. This baseless claim intensified the polarization in the country, leading to widespread mistrust in the democratic process and setting the stage for the events that unfolded on January 6. On January 6, as Congress gathered to certify the Electoral College results at the Capitol in Washington, DC, thousands of Trump supporters gathered for a rally near the White House. Trump, in a speech, continued to dispute the election results and urged his followers to march to the Capitol in protest. The situation quickly escalated into chaos, as a mob breached security barriers, stormed the Capitol building, vandalized offices, and clashed with law enforcement. The rioters disrupted the constitutional process and forced lawmakers to evacuate, delaying the certification of the election results. The violent attack resulted in multiple injuries, including law enforcement officers and civilians, and tragically led to the deaths of several individuals. The National Guard and additional law enforcement were deployed to restore order, eventually clearing the Capitol of rioters. The aftermath of the attack saw widespread condemnation from political leaders, both domestic and international, who denounced the assault on the heart of American democracy.

And the tone is becoming menacing. We're going to destroy the fucking Capitol! Fuck you, fuckers! You are safe! Just ahead, officers guarding the building are understaffed and ill-equipped for what's coming their way. You're the biggest! The building is more than two football fields in length. The barricades erected on the east side are defended by just a few dozen officers. The west side, facing Trump's rally, is even lighter.

You took a nose! Does that not mean a damn thing to you, does it? Metro Police will arrive within 15 minutes, but for reasons we'll explain later, the National Guard will arrive for over four hours. Meanwhile, more Capitol Police come to reinforce the line. It's the first time we see officers in riot here. Still, no BLM, Antifa, or the FBI, just a angry mob of Trump supporters who are now attacking the police officers. Yes, they are attacking the blue. And it's later reinforcements from the Metro Police arrive. A high ranking Metro officer immediately calls for more backup. Did you just go up to help make a line? They're pulling five pounds. They struggle to subjuge rioters who respond with their own chemical spray. And within 30 minutes, the police already have casualties. Multiple Capitol injuries in all caused by Donald Trump's supporters. Wow! The Capitol is now surrounded. The rioters haven't made it inside yet, but around the time that the mob on the east pushed forward, rioters on the west were making a pivotal move. Wow. This scaffolding was erected for the upcoming inauguration of Joe Biden. MAGA has no respect for law enforcement and it's very clear. Just look, no respect for the rule of law at all. And yes, once again, these are Trump supporters. It's an auto mayhem and it's about to get worse. The scene is being filmed from countless angles, allowing us to piece together moment by moment what comes next. The police shield is still to bash in a window. At 2.13 pm, the Capitol is breached. Michael Sparks, a Trump supporter from Kentucky, is the first person inside. A police officer seems unsure of what to do and backs off. Sparks is followed by proud boys and other far-right extremists. One carrying a Confederate flag, another armed with a baseball bat. When rioters break open the locked doors, hundreds more rushing. This is a critical moment. Officers must now defend the outside and inside of the building, stretching them even further. Yeah, no matter how many hours of footage, Mike Johnson or the man before him, Kevin McCarthy releases. It will not erase what we all just saw. Donald Trump instigated his supporters to get them to attack the United States Capitol. This is definitely Donald Trump's fault and the fault of all of the supporters that went along with this. So no more of this BLM Antifa or FBI nonsense. You can go watch this footage right here and see all the Trump flags. All right. Trump supporters! Get those knee pads and those elbow pads ready.

The United States of America just won the battle. I want you to look at the history of the United States post-civil war and really think about it for a second. We're going to distill a lot of information into a very small space and if anybody wants me to expand upon this, we will do so. The Confederate States rejoined the Union on their own terms. The only thing the South ceded to the Union was its right to own slaves. The initial concept of the Civil Rights Act was not passed. Abraham Lincoln was murdered. The South glossed over the notions of reconstruction and instead enacted and were allowed to operate for 99 years under their own racist and racially segregated bylaws that we call Jim Crow. Civil war ended April 9th, 1865. The United States signed the Civil Rights Act into law in 1964. If you look around today, do you see a United States? Or do you still see a country divided? Previously, the division of our country was somewhat geographical. They called it the Mason-Dixon Line. It was the North and the South. Our country is now divided along a political line, Democrat and Republican. But the ideas, the ideology, the principles of the Confederate States is alive and well today and it may not hold a popular position, American political space. It holds a pretty powerful position in our current American political space. Do not forget that just months ago, the constitutional protection against women's rights to bodily autonomy and medically safe abortions was removed. It is extremely easy to be dismissive of the Confederacy and the South and to proclaim that they lost the war, that they're losers and that it was a four-year, traitorous, treasonous run, all of which is true. But when I really sit back here and look at the history, it seems like the ideological demagogues of the South were playing chess. In the United States of America was playing checkers. And if we're not careful against the ideas and machinations of the Confederate ideology, we're going to see ourselves on the losing side of the war we didn't know we were even fighting.",subjective,american history

The United States of America just won the battle. I want you to look at the history of the United States post-civil war and really think about it for a second. We're going to distill a lot of information into a very small space and if anybody wants me to expand upon this, we will do so. The Confederate States rejoined the Union on their own terms. The only thing the South ceded to the Union was its right to own slaves. The initial concept of the Civil Rights Act was not passed. Abraham Lincoln was murdered. The South glossed over the notions of reconstruction and instead enacted and were allowed to operate for 99 years under their own racist and racially segregated bylaws that we call Jim Crow. Civil war ended April 9th, 1865. The United States signed the Civil Rights Act into law in 1964. If you look around today, do you see a United States? Or do you still see a country divided? Previously, the division of our country was somewhat geographical. They called it the Mason-Dixon Line. It was the North and the South. Our country is now divided along a political line, Democrat and Republican. But the ideas, the ideology, the principles of the Confederate States is alive and well today and it may not hold a popular position, American political space. It holds a pretty powerful position in our current American political space. Do not forget that just months ago, the constitutional protection against women's rights to bodily autonomy and medically safe abortions was removed. It is extremely easy to be dismissive of the Confederacy and the South and to proclaim that they lost the war, that they're losers and that it was a four-year, traitorous, treasonous run, all of which is true. But when I really sit back here and look at the history, it seems like the ideological demagogues of the South were playing chess. In the United States of America was playing checkers. And if we're not careful against the ideas and machinations of the Confederate ideology, we're going to see ourselves on the losing side of the war we didn't know we were even fighting.",subjective,american history

Oh, Civil War, the South was in shambles. They were suffering economically and enslaved people were freed. Some Confederates were wanted, others could not stand the idea of living under Yankee rule, and many still wanted to enslaved people, and they were willing to cross the border to live their dream lives. Confederates like Matthew Fontaine Mori made plans in advance to colonize with tens of thousands of southerners and they're enslaved people in foreign lands. The amount of southerners who actually left foreign lands will never be known, but it was enough to catch the attention of the media and highly ranked Confederates like Robert Lee, who opposed it. In Mexico, there were many settlements, but the largest one was in September of 1865, which was midway between Mexico City and Veracruz. The town was called Garlota, and it was a part of the new Virginia colony plan. Families there could purchase 640 acres each, and each acre cost them $1. Single men could buy 320 acres each, and within a year the town reached at least 3,000 southerners, many of which brought their enslaved people with them, because while slavery was illegal in Mexico at that point, P&H wasn't. The town's prosperity was short-lived, which forced the settlers to move elsewhere in Mexico or back to the United States. Brazil was the Latin American country that attracted the most Confederates because up until 1888 slavery was legal. In fact, Brazil was the last country of the Americas to abolish slavery. Here is an actual picture of one of the Confederate settlements in Brazil. Confederates initially settled in Sao Paolo, and many were able to buy acres for less than a quarter each. Their descendants are still waving the Confederate flag. They have intermarried and speak Portuguese now. They have an annual festival that still celebrates their Confederate history. Over the years, the descendants have faced criticism over their showing of the Confederate flag, and they've had historians, students, Americans, and vacationers visit them.

The United States of America just won the battle. I want you to look at the history of the United States post-civil war and really think about it for a second. We're going to distill a lot of information into a very small space and if anybody wants me to expand upon this, we will do so. The Confederate States rejoined the Union on their own terms. The only thing the South ceded to the Union was its right to own slaves. The initial concept of the Civil Rights Act was not passed. Abraham Lincoln was murdered. The South glossed over the notions of reconstruction and instead enacted and were allowed to operate for 99 years under their own racist and racially segregated bylaws that we call Jim Crow. Civil war ended April 9th, 1865. The United States signed the Civil Rights Act into law in 1964. If you look around today, do you see a United States? Or do you still see a country divided? Previously, the division of our country was somewhat geographical. They called it the Mason-Dixon Line. It was the North and the South. Our country is now divided along a political line, Democrat and Republican. But the ideas, the ideology, the principles of the Confederate States is alive and well today and it may not hold a popular position, American political space. It holds a pretty powerful position in our current American political space. Do not forget that just months ago, the constitutional protection against women's rights to bodily autonomy and medically safe abortions was removed. It is extremely easy to be dismissive of the Confederacy and the South and to proclaim that they lost the war, that they're losers and that it was a four-year, traitorous, treasonous run, all of which is true. But when I really sit back here and look at the history, it seems like the ideological demagogues of the South were playing chess. In the United States of America was playing checkers. And if we're not careful against the ideas and machinations of the Confederate ideology, we're going to see ourselves on the losing side of the war we didn't know we were even fighting.",subjective,american history

It will have one of the biggest and strongest economies in the world, with an impressive $7 trillion economy, which will rank Old Dixie as the third biggest economy, just after the United States and China. The United States will still maintain the first spot, despite losing $7 trillion of its economy. However, the per capita income of the Confederacy will be around 85.4K, making Dixies the sixth richest people, just after Qatar but above Singaporeans. The official language will obviously be English, and the capital will be Houston.

So they had a secret meeting and wheeling of Morgantown or somewhere ever again, but they held a vote to secede from Virginia back into the Union and had passed.

I cannot rank you any higher until you recognize a real-born shine It does not have a barcode number two Mississippi this one was tough. I love Mississippi It's one of the most beautiful states in the country and don't even get me started on how good their food is Do you remember in the blindside when coach shows said that you could stop it any Mississippi gas station and get the best Barber Cucayla of your life he wasn't joking But he also wasn't telling the whole truth because that gas station also has the best biscuit You've ever had as well as knockoff sunglasses tanning beds and accountant mechanic a notary.

Who was working that farm? My family was. My family was. Who was working the farm? They were poor. Do you know how much a slave cost back in? There's actually a noble answer to that question. By 1860 at the time of the Civil War, enslaved people's value was somewhere between $200 on the low end all the way up to $2,000. We're talking about in today's dollars, maybe somewhere between $2,400 and $50,000. There are even some estimates that say that some enslaved people were valued at somewhere around $180,000 in today's dollars. So you can think of it basically like owning a car. And about 1.6% of southern families owned more than 200 slaves, like having a whole car dealership. But about 20 to 25% of southerners at the time of the Civil War owned at least one enslaved person. It's like basically living in a society where wealthy people all have cars. Well, what do all the people who don't have cars want? A car. And even if a family worked on a small farm and didn't have enslaved people, what do you think their goal was? Their goal was to earn enough money to be able to buy people, to buy humans to do the work. It's not like families didn't aspire to have enslaved people. Why do you think that southern whites were willing to go to war? To literally go to war against the United States for slavery? Because remember every single state that's associated all 11 of them said explicitly, we're doing this to preserve slavery. Well, why would somebody who's on a small farm want to fight to preserve slavery? Because their aspiration was to become a major planter, which means a major slave owner. That's what they all wanted to do. That's what they all aspired to do. And they also wanted to defend the system whereby they couldn't be enslaved. Only Africans could. Only black people. And so that system of hierarchy that allowed any white person, no matter how rich or poor, to be superior to any black person, and for that black person to be captured and treated as property, and their children and their children's children owned by a white person. This is a system that benefited every single white person in this out. And by the way, every white person in the north too. Because even if you weren't a slave owner, you benefited from the economy that cotton production, that rice production, that all of these industries generated, you could benefit by being an insurance owner. Slaves were insured, like cars. And slave people also produced goods that were sold. So if you were somebody who was in the shipping business, or the cotton milling business, all of them benefited from slavery. So whether you were a small farmer or a big farmer, the slavery system benefited you. And you were willing to go to war to preserve it and to preserve white supremacy, because that was the whole basis of your society. And by the way, a lot of people in this out went to war simply because they were told to, and because they're rich people around them, made sure that the poor kids were doing the fighting. And so it doesn't matter whether your family was rich, poor, had one slave or ten or none. It doesn't matter. Everyone in the south benefited from that economy in that system, and they went toward a preserve it and to preserve white supremacy forever. So that's the answer to your question. You also told on yourself just by saying that at all, because like, why are you curious about how much they cost? You missed that system, right? You think things were better than? One last note, that flag is not even the flag that your forefathers fought under for their farm. That was not the flag of the Confederacy. That's a flag that they created afterwards. It's literally just a symbol of racism and white supremacy. And you're flying it because... ...mega. Peace out.",subjective,slavery

Let's talk about the layers of an image. If you're a fan of drag, you're familiar with the phrase drag is political. If you're not a fan of drag, you might not understand what that means. Some people think that drag is just pretty close and prancing around, and while thankfully a lot of it is, thank God. But many times through these close-up performances, people are able to make incredible political statements. Since drag is a performance art, a visual art, and there's an entertainment aspect to it, and it's, you know, someone's physical body. Drag queens are able to make images and statements that just aren't possible in any other art form. Cut to RuPaul in this dress when she was playing the drag queen Rachel Tension in two long-food things for everything, Julie Neumacher. The first layer of this image is, ah, black man, Confederate dress does not mix. This is the most shocking layer, so this is usually where a lot of people just stop. They just go, oh my God, Confederate, bad, black person should not be around Confederate nothing. But that's not their only layer. The first image of drag is never the only layer because drag is self-aware, and it's aware of what they're doing, and it's aware of how other people are going to perceive it. RuPaul did not wear the dress because she's the fan of the Confederacy. She didn't wear the dress because she wants the self to rise again. That's not why she wore the dress. She wore the dress to say, your little symbol means nothing to me, and I'm going to wear no one's going to be my ass. She knew racist white people. We're going to see this and just be confused, even the fact that the Confederate flag is in the drag space is taking the power out of it, taking the piss out of it. It's really all about taking the piss out of it, and showing that it's not that scary, defanging the monsters in the dark. That's what drag's all about.",subjective,drag performance

I'm in line and this younger white dude says, man, I got to ask you why you buying the Confederate flag and I can tell he asked what a lot of people were wondering. So a lot of ears start to tune in and I asked him, what do you think I got it for? And he said hopefully to burn it or wipe your ass with it. I got a teammate. The room was full of people that were like his racist grandparents. He didn't like immediately after he says that a older white lady says that's so unpactriotic. Why would you want to be disrespectful to American heritage? And I'm like youngsters, stand down. I got this. Ma'am, you are right and you are completely wrong about something. You are right about the fact that it is American heritage, but it is a side of American heritage. And that side wanted to preserve the institution of slavery and felt that blacks were subhuman. So it is American heritage, but it is reflective of the team that you are playing on when it comes to American heritage. And what you are completely wrong about is the Confederacy is the most unpatriotic group of people in American history. Patriotism is loyalty to your country and the person chosen to run your country. In this case, Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the United States and the United States had chosen a direction and the Confederacy did not agree with that and wanted to succeed from the United States. They engaged in an act of war against the government. If the Confederates were patriots, they would have followed the direction that the country was going and the leader that was elected to run this country. What they did was they chose to pick up arms and go to war against the United States of America. That is the most treasonous, unpatriotic thing in American history. Then an older white guy chimes in and he says this, Why do you always blame America for slavery? slavery was in Africa. slavery was in Rome. Slavery existed a lot of other places outside of America. Youngster, they fucking with the wrong one. Sir, there is one ingredients in American slavery that made it completely different from any other form of slavery that existed on the planet before it. That ingredients was based on a pseudo sign saying that the people being subjugated were not even a part of the human race. They were not homo sapiens. They were subhuman. The people being enslaved were not even being considered human beings. Slavery and other places never had that element in Rome and Africa. The people being subjugated were not seen as not being human. It was based solely on might is right. I defeated you. You can't beat me. Go take care of my cattle. But the idea that Africans were not even humans made American slavery totally different. It was more dehumanizing than any other form of slavery that existed on the planet before. This is an American ingenuity. If I own you and you have a kid, I own your kid. And if your kid has a kid, I own that kid. I own your whole bloodline. It is an egregious miscalculation to equate slavery in Africa, slavery in Rome and what the fuck was going on in America. Then I heard this. I got a lot of those flags around my house and I don't understand why people get all in a tizzy about this. Okay, man. Let me ask you this. If we was in Germany and somebody was flying the little mustache guys flag and saying that it was a part of German heritage, do you think that would be right? It is a part of German heritage. I don't see why it would be disrespectful. Youngster, this bit super racist. She had a little boy with her and I asked her was that her grandson or something. She says yes, he was autistic. So I told her, ma'am, do you realize that if you lived in Germany at that time, your grandson would have been euthanized under the Nazi regime. Shut her ass up.

Who was working that farm? My family was. My family was. Who was working the farm? They were poor. Do you know how much a slave cost back in? There's actually a noble answer to that question. By 1860 at the time of the Civil War, enslaved people's value was somewhere between $200 on the low end all the way up to $2,000. We're talking about in today's dollars, maybe somewhere between $2,400 and $50,000. There are even some estimates that say that some enslaved people were valued at somewhere around $180,000 in today's dollars. So you can think of it basically like owning a car. And about 1.6% of southern families owned more than 200 slaves, like having a whole car dealership. But about 20 to 25% of southerners at the time of the Civil War owned at least one enslaved person. It's like basically living in a society where wealthy people all have cars. Well, what do all the people who don't have cars want? A car. And even if a family worked on a small farm and didn't have enslaved people, what do you think their goal was? Their goal was to earn enough money to be able to buy people, to buy humans to do the work. It's not like families didn't aspire to have enslaved people. Why do you think that southern whites were willing to go to war? To literally go to war against the United States for slavery? Because remember every single state that's associated all 11 of them said explicitly, we're doing this to preserve slavery. Well, why would somebody who's on a small farm want to fight to preserve slavery? Because their aspiration was to become a major planter, which means a major slave owner. That's what they all wanted to do. That's what they all aspired to do. And they also wanted to defend the system whereby they couldn't be enslaved. Only Africans could. Only black people. And so that system of hierarchy that allowed any white person, no matter how rich or poor, to be superior to any black person, and for that black person to be captured and treated as property, and their children and their children's children owned by a white person. This is a system that benefited every single white person in this out. And by the way, every white person in the north too. Because even if you weren't a slave owner, you benefited from the economy that cotton production, that rice production, that all of these industries generated, you could benefit by being an insurance owner. Slaves were insured, like cars. And slave people also produced goods that were sold. So if you were somebody who was in the shipping business, or the cotton milling business, all of them benefited from slavery. So whether you were a small farmer or a big farmer, the slavery system benefited you. And you were willing to go to war to preserve it and to preserve white supremacy, because that was the whole basis of your society. And by the way, a lot of people in this out went to war simply because they were told to, and because they're rich people around them, made sure that the poor kids were doing the fighting. And so it doesn't matter whether your family was rich, poor, had one slave or ten or none. It doesn't matter. Everyone in the south benefited from that economy in that system, and they went toward a preserve it and to preserve white supremacy forever. So that's the answer to your question. You also told on yourself just by saying that at all, because like, why are you curious about how much they cost? You missed that system, right? You think things were better than? One last note, that flag is not even the flag that your forefathers fought under for their farm. That was not the flag of the Confederacy. That's a flag that they created afterwards. It's literally just a symbol of racism and white supremacy. And you're flying it because... ...mega. Peace out.",subjective,slavery

Let's talk about the layers of an image. If you're a fan of drag, you're familiar with the phrase drag is political. If you're not a fan of drag, you might not understand what that means. Some people think that drag is just pretty close and prancing around, and while thankfully a lot of it is, thank God. But many times through these close-up performances, people are able to make incredible political statements. Since drag is a performance art, a visual art, and there's an entertainment aspect to it, and it's, you know, someone's physical body. Drag queens are able to make images and statements that just aren't possible in any other art form. Cut to RuPaul in this dress when she was playing the drag queen Rachel Tension in two long-food things for everything, Julie Neumacher. The first layer of this image is, ah, black man, Confederate dress does not mix. This is the most shocking layer, so this is usually where a lot of people just stop. They just go, oh my God, Confederate, bad, black person should not be around Confederate nothing. But that's not their only layer. The first image of drag is never the only layer because drag is self-aware, and it's aware of what they're doing, and it's aware of how other people are going to perceive it. RuPaul did not wear the dress because she's the fan of the Confederacy. She didn't wear the dress because she wants the self to rise again. That's not why she wore the dress. She wore the dress to say, your little symbol means nothing to me, and I'm going to wear no one's going to be my ass. She knew racist white people. We're going to see this and just be confused, even the fact that the Confederate flag is in the drag space is taking the power out of it, taking the piss out of it. It's really all about taking the piss out of it, and showing that it's not that scary, defanging the monsters in the dark. That's what drag's all about.",subjective,drag politics

Who was working that farm? My family was. My family was. Who was working the farm? They were poor. Do you know how much a slave cost back in? There's actually a noble answer to that question. By 1860 at the time of the Civil War, enslaved people's value was somewhere between $200 on the low end all the way up to $2,000. We're talking about in today's dollars, maybe somewhere between $2,400 and $50,000. There are even some estimates that say that some enslaved people were valued at somewhere around $180,000 in today's dollars. So you can think of it basically like owning a car. And about 1.6% of southern families owned more than 200 slaves, like having a whole car dealership. But about 20 to 25% of southerners at the time of the Civil War owned at least one enslaved person. It's like basically living in a society where wealthy people all have cars. Well, what do all the people who don't have cars want? A car. And even if a family worked on a small farm and didn't have enslaved people, what do you think their goal was? Their goal was to earn enough money to be able to buy people, to buy humans to do the work. It's not like families didn't aspire to have enslaved people. Why do you think that southern whites were willing to go to war? To literally go to war against the United States for slavery? Because remember every single state that's associated all 11 of them said explicitly, we're doing this to preserve slavery. Well, why would somebody who's on a small farm want to fight to preserve slavery? Because their aspiration was to become a major planter, which means a major slave owner. That's what they all wanted to do. That's what they all aspired to do. And they also wanted to defend the system whereby they couldn't be enslaved. Only Africans could. Only black people. And so that system of hierarchy that allowed any white person, no matter how rich or poor, to be superior to any black person, and for that black person to be captured and treated as property, and their children and their children's children owned by a white person. This is a system that benefited every single white person in this out. And by the way, every white person in the north too. Because even if you weren't a slave owner, you benefited from the economy that cotton production, that rice production, that all of these industries generated, you could benefit by being an insurance owner. Slaves were insured, like cars. And slave people also produced goods that were sold. So if you were somebody who was in the shipping business, or the cotton milling business, all of them benefited from slavery. So whether you were a small farmer or a big farmer, the slavery system benefited you. And you were willing to go to war to preserve it and to preserve white supremacy, because that was the whole basis of your society. And by the way, a lot of people in this out went to war simply because they were told to, and because they're rich people around them, made sure that the poor kids were doing the fighting. And so it doesn't matter whether your family was rich, poor, had one slave or ten or none. It doesn't matter. Everyone in the south benefited from that economy in that system, and they went toward a preserve it and to preserve white supremacy forever. So that's the answer to your question. You also told on yourself just by saying that at all, because like, why are you curious about how much they cost? You missed that system, right? You think things were better than? One last note, that flag is not even the flag that your forefathers fought under for their farm. That was not the flag of the Confederacy. That's a flag that they created afterwards. It's literally just a symbol of racism and white supremacy. And you're flying it because... ...mega. Peace out.",subjective,slavery

Let's talk about the layers of an image. If you're a fan of drag, you're familiar with the phrase drag is political. If you're not a fan of drag, you might not understand what that means. Some people think that drag is just pretty close and prancing around, and while thankfully a lot of it is, thank God. But many times through these close-up performances, people are able to make incredible political statements. Since drag is a performance art, a visual art, and there's an entertainment aspect to it, and it's, you know, someone's physical body. Drag queens are able to make images and statements that just aren't possible in any other art form. Cut to RuPaul in this dress when she was playing the drag queen Rachel Tension in two long-food things for everything, Julie Neumacher. The first layer of this image is, ah, black man, Confederate dress does not mix. This is the most shocking layer, so this is usually where a lot of people just stop. They just go, oh my God, Confederate, bad, black person should not be around Confederate nothing. But that's not their only layer. The first image of drag is never the only layer because drag is self-aware, and it's aware of what they're doing, and it's aware of how other people are going to perceive it. RuPaul did not wear the dress because she's the fan of the Confederacy. She didn't wear the dress because she wants the self to rise again. That's not why she wore the dress. She wore the dress to say, your little symbol means nothing to me, and I'm going to wear no one's going to be my ass. She knew racist white people. We're going to see this and just be confused, even the fact that the Confederate flag is in the drag space is taking the power out of it, taking the piss out of it. It's really all about taking the piss out of it, and showing that it's not that scary, defanging the monsters in the dark. That's what drag's all about.",subjective,drag politics

So I get a call from one of my friends who had just visited this flea market and he said that they have a bunch of cool stuff. Me, flea markets, cool shit, I'm in there. I go to this flea market in this very rural area in Indiana. Now this is deep red Indiana territory. It fits perfectly down there with Alabama and Mississippi. I walk in and I see it is a large crowd of older white people, 50 and up. They are looking at me like I just walked off of a UFO. As I'm walking around, I'm seeing a lot of Confederate flag themed memoravile. So with all these white people here, I said I'm going to buy one of these flags because I want to see what their reaction is to a black guy buying a Confederate flag. So I got it and I'm carrying it very visibly so everybody can see that I have it. And I definitely got their attention. I'm in line and this younger white dude says, man, I got to ask you why you buying the Confederate flag and I can tell he asked what a lot of people were wondering. So a lot of ears start to tune in and I asked him, what do you think I got it for? And he said hopefully to burn it or wipe your ass with it. I got a teammate. The room was full of people that were like his racist grandparents. He didn't like immediately after he says that a older white lady says that's so unpactriotic. Why would you want to be disrespectful to American heritage? And I'm like youngsters, stand down. I got this. Ma'am, you are right and you are completely wrong about something. You are right about the fact that it is American heritage, but it is a side of American heritage. And that side wanted to preserve the institution of slavery and felt that blacks were subhuman. So it is American heritage, but it is reflective of the team that you are playing on when it comes to American heritage. And what you are completely wrong about is the Confederacy is the most unpatriotic group of people in American history. Patriotism is loyalty to your country and the person chosen to run your country. In this case, Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the United States and the United States had chosen a direction and the Confederacy did not agree with that and wanted to succeed from the United States. They engaged in an act of war against the government. If the Confederates were patriots, they would have followed the direction that the country was going and the leader that was elected to run this country. What they did was they chose to pick up arms and go to war against the United States of America. That is the most treasonous, unpatriotic thing in American history. Then an older white guy chimes in and he says this, Why do you always blame America for slavery? slavery was in Africa. slavery was in Rome. Slavery existed a lot of other places outside of America. Youngster, they fucking with the wrong one. Sir, there is one ingredients in American slavery that made it completely different from any other form of slavery that existed on the planet before it. That ingredients was based on a pseudo sign saying that the people being subjugated were not even a part of the human race. They were not homo sapiens. They were subhuman. The people being enslaved were not even being considered human beings. Slavery and other places never had that element in Rome and Africa. The people being subjugated were not seen as not being human. It was based solely on might is right. I defeated you. You can't beat me. Go take care of my cattle. But the idea that Africans were not even humans made American slavery totally different. It was more dehumanizing than any other form of slavery that existed on the planet before. This is an American ingenuity. If I own you and you have a kid, I own your kid. And if your kid has a kid, I own that kid. I own your whole bloodline. It is an egregious miscalculation to equate slavery in Africa, slavery in Rome and what the fuck was going on in America. Then I heard this. I got a lot of those flags around my house and I don't understand why people get all in a tizzy about this. Okay, man. Let me ask you this. If we was in Germany and somebody was flying the little mustache guys flag and saying that it was a part of German heritage, do you think that would be right? It is a part of German heritage. I don't see why it would be disrespectful. Youngster, this bit super racist. She had a little boy with her and I asked her was that her grandson or something. She says yes, he was autistic. So I told her, ma'am, do you realize that if you lived in Germany at that time, your grandson would have been euthanized under the Nazi regime. Shut her ass up. The rest of them are looking dumbfounded and youngster looking like we just wanted a super bowl. Got to the parking lot, chopped it up with youngster. He's super cool. He invited me to his bonfire where we burned in this damn thing.",subjective,american heritage

We happened to do what all my friends were doing. They were my friends. And we were just acting like everybody we knew acted. Oh.

Who was working that farm? My family was. My family was. Who was working the farm? They were poor. Do you know how much a slave cost back in? There's actually a noble answer to that question. By 1860 at the time of the Civil War, enslaved people's value was somewhere between $200 on the low end all the way up to $2,000. We're talking about in today's dollars, maybe somewhere between $2,400 and $50,000. There are even some estimates that say that some enslaved people were valued at somewhere around $180,000 in today's dollars. So you can think of it basically like owning a car. And about 1.6% of southern families owned more than 200 slaves, like having a whole car dealership. But about 20 to 25% of southerners at the time of the Civil War owned at least one enslaved person. It's like basically living in a society where wealthy people all have cars. Well, what do all the people who don't have cars want? A car. And even if a family worked on a small farm and didn't have enslaved people, what do you think their goal was? Their goal was to earn enough money to be able to buy people, to buy humans to do the work. It's not like families didn't aspire to have enslaved people. Why do you think that southern whites were willing to go to war? To literally go to war against the United States for slavery? Because remember every single state that's associated all 11 of them said explicitly, we're doing this to preserve slavery. Well, why would somebody who's on a small farm want to fight to preserve slavery? Because their aspiration was to become a major planter, which means a major slave owner. That's what they all wanted to do. That's what they all aspired to do. And they also wanted to defend the system whereby they couldn't be enslaved. Only Africans could. Only black people. And so that system of hierarchy that allowed any white person, no matter how rich or poor, to be superior to any black person, and for that black person to be captured and treated as property, and their children and their children's children owned by a white person. This is a system that benefited every single white person in this out. And by the way, every white person in the north too. Because even if you weren't a slave owner, you benefited from the economy that cotton production, that rice production, that all of these industries generated, you could benefit by being an insurance owner. Slaves were insured, like cars. And slave people also produced goods that were sold. So if you were somebody who was in the shipping business, or the cotton milling business, all of them benefited from slavery. So whether you were a small farmer or a big farmer, the slavery system benefited you. And you were willing to go to war to preserve it and to preserve white supremacy, because that was the whole basis of your society. And by the way, a lot of people in this out went to war simply because they were told to, and because they're rich people around them, made sure that the poor kids were doing the fighting. And so it doesn't matter whether your family was rich, poor, had one slave or ten or none. It doesn't matter. Everyone in the south benefited from that economy in that system, and they went toward a preserve it and to preserve white supremacy forever. So that's the answer to your question. You also told on yourself just by saying that at all, because like, why are you curious about how much they cost? You missed that system, right? You think things were better than? One last note, that flag is not even the flag that your forefathers fought under for their farm. That was not the flag of the Confederacy. That's a flag that they created afterwards. It's literally just a symbol of racism and white supremacy. And you're flying it because... ...mega. Peace out.",subjective,slavery

Let's talk about the layers of an image. If you're a fan of drag, you're familiar with the phrase drag is political. If you're not a fan of drag, you might not understand what that means. Some people think that drag is just pretty close and prancing around, and while thankfully a lot of it is, thank God. But many times through these close-up performances, people are able to make incredible political statements. Since drag is a performance art, a visual art, and there's an entertainment aspect to it, and it's, you know, someone's physical body. Drag queens are able to make images and statements that just aren't possible in any other art form. Cut to RuPaul in this dress when she was playing the drag queen Rachel Tension in two long-food things for everything, Julie Neumacher. The first layer of this image is, ah, black man, Confederate dress does not mix. This is the most shocking layer, so this is usually where a lot of people just stop. They just go, oh my God, Confederate, bad, black person should not be around Confederate nothing. But that's not their only layer. The first image of drag is never the only layer because drag is self-aware, and it's aware of what they're doing, and it's aware of how other people are going to perceive it. RuPaul did not wear the dress because she's the fan of the Confederacy. She didn't wear the dress because she wants the self to rise again. That's not why she wore the dress. She wore the dress to say, your little symbol means nothing to me, and I'm going to wear no one's going to be my ass. She knew racist white people. We're going to see this and just be confused, even the fact that the Confederate flag is in the drag space is taking the power out of it, taking the piss out of it. It's really all about taking the piss out of it, and showing that it's not that scary, defanging the monsters in the dark. That's what drag's all about.",subjective,drag politics

So I get a call from one of my friends who had just visited this flea market and he said that they have a bunch of cool stuff. Me, flea markets, cool shit, I'm in there. I go to this flea market in this very rural area in Indiana. Now this is deep red Indiana territory. It fits perfectly down there with Alabama and Mississippi. I walk in and I see it is a large crowd of older white people, 50 and up. They are looking at me like I just walked off of a UFO. As I'm walking around, I'm seeing a lot of Confederate flag themed memoravile. So with all these white people here, I said I'm going to buy one of these flags because I want to see what their reaction is to a black guy buying a Confederate flag. So I got it and I'm carrying it very visibly so everybody can see that I have it. And I definitely got their attention. I'm in line and this younger white dude says, man, I got to ask you why you buying the Confederate flag and I can tell he asked what a lot of people were wondering. So a lot of ears start to tune in and I asked him, what do you think I got it for? And he said hopefully to burn it or wipe your ass with it. I got a teammate. The room was full of people that were like his racist grandparents. He didn't like immediately after he says that a older white lady says that's so unpactriotic. Why would you want to be disrespectful to American heritage? And I'm like youngsters, stand down. I got this. Ma'am, you are right and you are completely wrong about something. You are right about the fact that it is American heritage, but it is a side of American heritage. And that side wanted to preserve the institution of slavery and felt that blacks were subhuman. So it is American heritage, but it is reflective of the team that you are playing on when it comes to American heritage. And what you are completely wrong about is the Confederacy is the most unpatriotic group of people in American history. Patriotism is loyalty to your country and the person chosen to run your country. In this case, Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the United States and the United States had chosen a direction and the Confederacy did not agree with that and wanted to succeed from the United States. They engaged in an act of war against the government. If the Confederates were patriots, they would have followed the direction that the country was going and the leader that was elected to run this country. What they did was they chose to pick up arms and go to war against the United States of America. That is the most treasonous, unpatriotic thing in American history. Then an older white guy chimes in and he says this, Why do you always blame America for slavery? slavery was in Africa. slavery was in Rome. Slavery existed a lot of other places outside of America. Youngster, they fucking with the wrong one. Sir, there is one ingredients in American slavery that made it completely different from any other form of slavery that existed on the planet before it. That ingredients was based on a pseudo sign saying that the people being subjugated were not even a part of the human race. They were not homo sapiens. They were subhuman. The people being enslaved were not even being considered human beings. Slavery and other places never had that element in Rome and Africa. The people being subjugated were not seen as not being human. It was based solely on might is right. I defeated you. You can't beat me. Go take care of my cattle. But the idea that Africans were not even humans made American slavery totally different. It was more dehumanizing than any other form of slavery that existed on the planet before. This is an American ingenuity. If I own you and you have a kid, I own your kid. And if your kid has a kid, I own that kid. I own your whole bloodline. It is an egregious miscalculation to equate slavery in Africa, slavery in Rome and what the fuck was going on in America. Then I heard this. I got a lot of those flags around my house and I don't understand why people get all in a tizzy about this. Okay, man. Let me ask you this. If we was in Germany and somebody was flying the little mustache guys flag and saying that it was a part of German heritage, do you think that would be right? It is a part of German heritage. I don't see why it would be disrespectful. Youngster, this bit super racist. She had a little boy with her and I asked her was that her grandson or something. She says yes, he was autistic. So I told her, ma'am, do you realize that if you lived in Germany at that time, your grandson would have been euthanized under the Nazi regime. Shut her ass up. The rest of them are looking dumbfounded and youngster looking like we just wanted a super bowl. Got to the parking lot, chopped it up with youngster. He's super cool. He invited me to his bonfire where we burned in this damn thing.",subjective,american heritage

A lot of people have asked and also sometimes are surprised to know that Democrats serve as chairman in the Texas House and that's 100% true. We spend a lot of money in the general election to defeat Democrats. We a lot of narratives are written about how bad they are, how we don't want them in leadership. We don't want them to have the elected office, but yet in the Texas House, we literally give them chairmanship, which means they have more leverage and more power than they earn on election day. I don't think other members necessarily hide it. I think they just accept it. A lot of it is the legislature is treated as just a club. I mean, there's a lot of nice people. We have to hang out together and we go to meals and other things with each other a lot. So of course, they want to come lottery. And I think the Republican members don't want to mess that up. I think they're hoping that if the Democrats take over, the Democrats will make sure they're chairman, or they just want to have this persona as being bipartisan. The problem is what we lose while they're gaining the friendship, the bipartisan persona, and all that, we're losing good conservative public policy being implemented in our life. And I've been asked, you know, what conservative legislation is killed? Well, any is possible. Any on day one, because as bills removing, like I say, these Democrat chairman can say, hey, y'all have this important bill in these committees. Those are dead on arrival, because why? These are moving. And it just holds our bills hostage. And, you know, we don't get hearings on the Trump wall. We don't get hearings on banning in-state tuition for illegals. And on and on and on, we see problems. The CRT bill we had in the regular session got watered down by the Democrats. People say that if we don't allow Democrats to be chairman, then somehow we're going to look just like DC. Because when you see up in Congress, we're trying to win the House back. That's the talk up in DC. Guess what? If Republicans around the country show up and vote, and we have the majority in the U.S. Congress, we aren't punished with Nancy Pelosi's leadership. That seems like a pretty common sense strategy, common sense, you know, a result of a Republican showing up to vote. In Texas, you're about to see what, six or seven, eight, nine months, bashing Beto, bashing AOC, the Democrats, and Joe Biden's failed policies. But what they don't want to tell you is that if Beto was running for Texas House Representatives, he could be a chairman. Nancy Pelosi could be a chairman. All these Democrats they want a point to could be a chairman in the Texas House Representatives. So in a way, we look worse than DC. What does it say about our Republican leadership? That there are Republicans that instead of them becoming an actual chairman in the Texas House, they would rather vote to give it away to Democrats. Because there's 30-something committees. There's Republicans that are not going to be chairman in the Texas House. And a lot of members down there live for that title. Let me tell you, they live for the title being called Chairman. And the reason they're not is because they themselves vote and support giving the chairmanship to Democrats. It doesn't make sense to me or a lot of Republican voters why we do this to ourselves. And I don't really care if someone thinks we look like DC. We need to stand up for Texas period. And if that means making sure Republicans are the chairman, we should do that. So if this passes, if we wind up getting in the rules that only the majority party can be chairman, implementing conservative public policy in our lives has just increased dramatically. The second thing it does is it puts more pressure on us for Republicans. Because now we're not going to be able to say, oh, it died in committee or it died in the process. We ran out of time. We are literally in control of what's happening in that body. No one can mess up the plans by killing these other bills because they're a chairman. We literally are going to be in the driver's seat and the Democrats will have to fight as though they don't have the votes to stop a lot of things. So it has the potential for great things to happen in Texas, but it also puts way more of a burden on the Republican elected official and our leadership caucus chair speaker of the House.

So we had our first funnel deadline, bills that don't make it through these committees are not eligible for their consideration, so everyone tries to shove a bunch of things through quickly. Their priority seems to be a bunch of bills aimed at trans kids. One example, school district employees would need parental permission to use a nickname or pronoun for a student that's not on the child's birth certificate. A camera on his lobbyist says that parents should have the ultimate responsibility and right to decide what is in the best interest of their children, including when it comes to their education. None related news, committee passed a bill banning gender-forming care for minors, moved that contradicts the guidance of doctors in state and national medical association, so much for the parents having the right to decide. Lawmakers advance the bill at limits eminent domain power for companies looking to run CO2 pipelines in Iowa. This bill might not be awful, but I'm hesitant to give any credit because I doubt it'll stop anything that will benefit ethanol. Lawmakers at the State House introduced proposed constitutional amendment on Tuesday to ban gay marriage in Iowa. Sounds like it's not going anywhere, but it shows you where some Iowa Republicans are at. This week, a bill introduced at the State House with ban abortion in Iowa. It's called the Iowa Human Life Protection Act. It would penalize doctors and anyone who helps trying to get an abortion. It would also require internet providers to block Iowa's access to websites related to abortion care. A child labor bill got through with 16 to 17 year olds in Iowa could work in bars and sell or serve drinks. With parental permission, 15 year olds could perform light assembly work, provided it is not on a machine or in an area with machines, but somehow 14 year olds could work in meat lockers. In unrelated news, a new report from the Iowa Cancer Registry shows the state is protected to have the second highest incident rate of cancer cases in the country this year. Doesn't look like there's going to be any action taken on that though. I'll leave you with a quote from Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Confirst. If you were to look at this legislator's work, you would think the biggest problem facing our state is trans kids in gay marriage. Instead, the problems facing our state are rising cancer rates, our homeless kids, our schools at new additional help, our mental health crisis that I've heard about over and over. We've done nothing to address these issues, but it looks like all we can do is sign petitions. We can do better. Thanks for watching.",subjective,transgender

This practice, embraced by current House Leadership, gives Democrats more leverage than they earn from voters on Election Day. The reason? Camaraderie  and cooperation and prioritized over advancing Republican priorities.",False,,texasscorecard,Texas Scorecard,,,,,,False,Republican State Leadership Committee,2021,@texasscorecard_video_7187242756404727082.txt," It is 100% on us and we don't get to blame the Democrats. I'm Brian Slayton, I'm state representative, House District 2, which is Hunt, Hopkins, and Van St. Kent's. A lot of people have asked and also sometimes are surprised to know that Democrats serve as chairman in the Texas House and that's 100% true. We spend a lot of money in the general election to defeat Democrats. We a lot of narratives are written about how bad they are, how we don't want them in leadership. We don't want them to have the elected office, but yet in the Texas House, we literally give them chairmanship, which means they have more leverage and more power than they earn on election day. I don't think other members necessarily hide it. I think they just accept it. A lot of it is the legislature is treated as just a club. I mean, there's a lot of nice people. We have to hang out together and we go to meals and other things with each other a lot. So of course, they want to come lottery. And I think the Republican members don't want to mess that up. I think they're hoping that if the Democrats take over, the Democrats will make sure they're chairman, or they just want to have this persona as being bipartisan. The problem is what we lose while they're gaining the friendship, the bipartisan persona, and all that, we're losing good conservative public policy being implemented in our life. And I've been asked, you know, what conservative legislation is killed? Well, any is possible. Any on day one, because as bills removing, like I say, these Democrat chairman can say, hey, y'all have this important bill in these committees. Those are dead on arrival, because why? These are moving. And it just holds our bills hostage. And, you know, we don't get hearings on the Trump wall. We don't get hearings on banning in-state tuition for illegals. And on and on and on, we see problems. The CRT bill we had in the regular session got watered down by the Democrats. People say that if we don't allow Democrats to be chairman, then somehow we're going to look just like DC. Because when you see up in Congress, we're trying to win the House back. That's the talk up in DC. Guess what? If Republicans around the country show up and vote, and we have the majority in the U.S. Congress, we aren't punished with Nancy Pelosi's leadership. That seems like a pretty common sense strategy, common sense, you know, a result of a Republican showing up to vote. In Texas, you're about to see what, six or seven, eight, nine months, bashing Beto, bashing AOC, the Democrats, and Joe Biden's failed policies. But what they don't want to tell you is that if Beto was running for Texas House Representatives, he could be a chairman. Nancy Pelosi could be a chairman. All these Democrats they want a point to could be a chairman in the Texas House Representatives. So in a way, we look worse than DC. What does it say about our Republican leadership? That there are Republicans that instead of them becoming an actual chairman in the Texas House, they would rather vote to give it away to Democrats. Because there's 30-something committees. There's Republicans that are not going to be chairman in the Texas House. And a lot of members down there live for that title. Let me tell you, they live for the title being called Chairman. And the reason they're not is because they themselves vote and support giving the chairmanship to Democrats. It doesn't make sense to me or a lot of Republican voters why we do this to ourselves. And I don't really care if someone thinks we look like DC. We need to stand up for Texas period. And if that means making sure Republicans are the chairman, we should do that. So if this passes, if we wind up getting in the rules that only the majority party can be chairman, implementing conservative public policy in our lives has just increased dramatically. The second thing it does is it puts more pressure on us for Republicans. Because now we're not going to be able to say, oh, it died in committee or it died in the process. We ran out of time. We are literally in control of what's happening in that body. No one can mess up the plans by killing these other bills because they're a chairman. We literally are going to be in the driver's seat and the Democrats will have to fight as though they don't have the votes to stop a lot of things. So it has the potential for great things to happen in Texas, but it also puts way more of a burden on the Republican elected official and our leadership caucus chair speaker of the House. Because now if we don't pass these items, it is 100% on us and we don't get to blame the Democrats. Do you want to get your news from people who share your values? Texas scorecard.

This practice, embraced by current House Leadership, gives Democrats more leverage than they earn from voters on Election Day. The reason? Camaraderie  and cooperation and prioritized over advancing Republican priorities.",False,,texasscorecard,Texas Scorecard,,,,,,False,Republican State Leadership Committee,2021,@texasscorecard_video_7187242756404727082.txt," It is 100% on us and we don't get to blame the Democrats. I'm Brian Slayton, I'm state representative, House District 2, which is Hunt, Hopkins, and Van St. Kent's. A lot of people have asked and also sometimes are surprised to know that Democrats serve as chairman in the Texas House and that's 100% true. We spend a lot of money in the general election to defeat Democrats. We a lot of narratives are written about how bad they are, how we don't want them in leadership. We don't want them to have the elected office, but yet in the Texas House, we literally give them chairmanship, which means they have more leverage and more power than they earn on election day. I don't think other members necessarily hide it. I think they just accept it. A lot of it is the legislature is treated as just a club. I mean, there's a lot of nice people. We have to hang out together and we go to meals and other things with each other a lot. So of course, they want to come lottery. And I think the Republican members don't want to mess that up. I think they're hoping that if the Democrats take over, the Democrats will make sure they're chairman, or they just want to have this persona as being bipartisan. The problem is what we lose while they're gaining the friendship, the bipartisan persona, and all that, we're losing good conservative public policy being implemented in our life. And I've been asked, you know, what conservative legislation is killed? Well, any is possible. Any on day one, because as bills removing, like I say, these Democrat chairman can say, hey, y'all have this important bill in these committees. Those are dead on arrival, because why? These are moving. And it just holds our bills hostage. And, you know, we don't get hearings on the Trump wall. We don't get hearings on banning in-state tuition for illegals. And on and on and on, we see problems. The CRT bill we had in the regular session got watered down by the Democrats. People say that if we don't allow Democrats to be chairman, then somehow we're going to look just like DC. Because when you see up in Congress, we're trying to win the House back. That's the talk up in DC. Guess what? If Republicans around the country show up and vote, and we have the majority in the U.S. Congress, we aren't punished with Nancy Pelosi's leadership. That seems like a pretty common sense strategy, common sense, you know, a result of a Republican showing up to vote. In Texas, you're about to see what, six or seven, eight, nine months, bashing Beto, bashing AOC, the Democrats, and Joe Biden's failed policies. But what they don't want to tell you is that if Beto was running for Texas House Representatives, he could be a chairman. Nancy Pelosi could be a chairman. All these Democrats they want a point to could be a chairman in the Texas House Representatives. So in a way, we look worse than DC. What does it say about our Republican leadership? That there are Republicans that instead of them becoming an actual chairman in the Texas House, they would rather vote to give it away to Democrats. Because there's 30-something committees. There's Republicans that are not going to be chairman in the Texas House. And a lot of members down there live for that title. Let me tell you, they live for the title being called Chairman. And the reason they're not is because they themselves vote and support giving the chairmanship to Democrats. It doesn't make sense to me or a lot of Republican voters why we do this to ourselves. And I don't really care if someone thinks we look like DC. We need to stand up for Texas period. And if that means making sure Republicans are the chairman, we should do that. So if this passes, if we wind up getting in the rules that only the majority party can be chairman, implementing conservative public policy in our lives has just increased dramatically. The second thing it does is it puts more pressure on us for Republicans. Because now we're not going to be able to say, oh, it died in committee or it died in the process. We ran out of time. We are literally in control of what's happening in that body. No one can mess up the plans by killing these other bills because they're a chairman. We literally are going to be in the driver's seat and the Democrats will have to fight as though they don't have the votes to stop a lot of things. So it has the potential for great things to happen in Texas, but it also puts way more of a burden on the Republican elected official and our leadership caucus chair speaker of the House. Because now if we don't pass these items, it is 100% on us and we don't get to blame the Democrats. Do you want to get your news from people who share your values? Texas scorecard.

So we had our first funnel deadline, bills that don't make it through these committees are not eligible for their consideration, so everyone tries to shove a bunch of things through quickly. Their priority seems to be a bunch of bills aimed at trans kids. One example, school district employees would need parental permission to use a nickname or pronoun for a student that's not on the child's birth certificate. A camera on his lobbyist says that parents should have the ultimate responsibility and right to decide what is in the best interest of their children, including when it comes to their education. None related news, committee passed a bill banning gender-forming care for minors, moved that contradicts the guidance of doctors in state and national medical association, so much for the parents having the right to decide. Lawmakers advance the bill at limits eminent domain power for companies looking to run CO2 pipelines in Iowa. This bill might not be awful, but I'm hesitant to give any credit because I doubt it'll stop anything that will benefit ethanol. Lawmakers at the State House introduced proposed constitutional amendment on Tuesday to ban gay marriage in Iowa. Sounds like it's not going anywhere, but it shows you where some Iowa Republicans are at. This week, a bill introduced at the State House with ban abortion in Iowa. It's called the Iowa Human Life Protection Act. It would penalize doctors and anyone who helps trying to get an abortion. It would also require internet providers to block Iowa's access to websites related to abortion care. A child labor bill got through with 16 to 17 year olds in Iowa could work in bars and sell or serve drinks. With parental permission, 15 year olds could perform light assembly work, provided it is not on a machine or in an area with machines, but somehow 14 year olds could work in meat lockers. In unrelated news, a new report from the Iowa Cancer Registry shows the state is protected to have the second highest incident rate of cancer cases in the country this year. Doesn't look like there's going to be any action taken on that though. I'll leave you with a quote from Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Confirst. If you were to look at this legislator's work, you would think the biggest problem facing our state is trans kids in gay marriage. Instead, the problems facing our state are rising cancer rates, our homeless kids, our schools at new additional help, our mental health crisis that I've heard about over and over. We've done nothing to address these issues, but it looks like all we can do is sign petitions. We can do better. Thanks for watching.",subjective,transgender

In case you're unfamiliar, Liberty University is by far the biggest and most influential Christian college in the nation. It was founded by the famous pastor Jerry Falwell and has grown to be one of the most prominent Christian organizations in the country. The Clary Act is a law that requires colleges and universities that receive federal funding to collect data on campus crime and notify students of threats. Schools must disseminate an annual security report that includes crime reports and information to improve campus safety. And as the article says, Liberty has marketed itself for years as having one of the safest campuses in the nation with 15,000 students enrolled in the school in Lynchburg. Its police department had one single officer with little to no oversight investigating all crimes for just under a decade for 15,000 students plus residents plus faculty. And the U.S. Department of Education said it identified numerous cases that resulted in misclassification or underreporting of crimes. Instead of just underreporting crimes or trying to hide sexual crimes, many victims of sexual crimes feared reporting because of concerns of reprisal. The final program review stated several were punished for violating the student cone of conduct known as the Liberty Way while there are salents were left unpunished. There's a story up here. I'm not going to get into too much of the details up, but it's it's basically that, but I'm not going to read it for you here on TikTok. It's a little nasty. Consequently, many victims of sexual assault felt dissuaded by Liberty administration's reputation for punishing sexual assault survivors rather than helping them. Such fears created a culture of silence where sexual assaults commonly went unreported at Liberty University. Liberty University has admitted some fault here, paying the fines, they're cooperating, they're trying to clean this up. And I think one of the main reasons they're doing that is because they don't want the university to get a bad reputation. If a Christian college gets a reputation for being a rape school, it's going to completely implode. However, they're also dealing with issues above lawsuits by former students and employees who accuse the school of all of these things. And they just recently settled a civil suit with 12 women after they accused the school of fostering an unsafe environment and mishandling cases of sexual assault. So yeah, the the private Christian University at Lynchburg, Virginia, maybe not the safest campus to go to.",subjective,campus

I'm like low key referencing the Liberty way which is like our honor code system. So here are some things about our dress code. There's technically two different types of dress code. So like just like dress for like class dress and then like gym and like other stuff. You have to be covering your whole chest sides of your body midsection all that. And if you're gonna wear like skirts or a dress they have to be down to your mid thigh which like is never really enforced and there's a lot of people who wear like yeah.

You can't wear shorts to class and you're technically supposed to wear long pants to class and you have to have on shoes obviously. If you're ever wearing a bikini on campus it has to be not a bikini. It has to be a tan-kini or a one-piece which we can make a one-piece work. tan-kini-young. You can't wear shorts to class. I don't know if you I've said that already but then at the gym it's very like sometimes it's super strict and sometimes it's more lenient. Basically you can't be showing any of your like midsection and one time I got dress coated for being in stuff that was like everything was tight.

So the Ring By Spring culture is that you literally get married while you're going to school there. Like fresh man of roles. Oh, that's not a rule but that's how it's done. It's not a rule but it always happens. But it's not a rule but it's the answer. You have to be over 21 to move off campus unless you feel like an exemption form for mental health or some other... Some other reason. ...thing that would get you approved to move off campus. Which we did! Which we did! So we have something called convocation every Wednesday and Friday from 10.30 to 12. Where you have to go with basically like charge for those of you who don't know what that is. And while you are at combo, your arrays will go into your room, make sure it's clean, your beds made. Your bed has to be made. Your stuff is together. Garbage taken out. No, above the floor. Nothing on the floor. Nothing. Clean up your laundry. And if this isn't, you get points taken away and points will get you out of the university. And what are points equal? Money that you are. Fine. Come back for a part two. I have more on your mind. Also disclaimer, we love our university and these are just the rules. We're not bashing it. Where we go, like actually come here, we love it so much and the rules me out, I think so, guys.

In case you're unfamiliar, Liberty University is by far the biggest and most influential Christian college in the nation. It was founded by the famous pastor Jerry Falwell and has grown to be one of the most prominent Christian organizations in the country. The Clary Act is a law that requires colleges and universities that receive federal funding to collect data on campus crime and notify students of threats. Schools must disseminate an annual security report that includes crime reports and information to improve campus safety. And as the article says, Liberty has marketed itself for years as having one of the safest campuses in the nation with 15,000 students enrolled in the school in Lynchburg. Its police department had one single officer with little to no oversight investigating all crimes for just under a decade for 15,000 students plus residents plus faculty. And the U.S. Department of Education said it identified numerous cases that resulted in misclassification or underreporting of crimes. Instead of just underreporting crimes or trying to hide sexual crimes, many victims of sexual crimes feared reporting because of concerns of reprisal. The final program review stated several were punished for violating the student cone of conduct known as the Liberty Way while there are salents were left unpunished. There's a story up here. I'm not going to get into too much of the details up, but it's it's basically that, but I'm not going to read it for you here on TikTok. It's a little nasty. Consequently, many victims of sexual assault felt dissuaded by Liberty administration's reputation for punishing sexual assault survivors rather than helping them. Such fears created a culture of silence where sexual assaults commonly went unreported at Liberty University. Liberty University has admitted some fault here, paying the fines, they're cooperating, they're trying to clean this up. And I think one of the main reasons they're doing that is because they don't want the university to get a bad reputation. If a Christian college gets a reputation for being a rape school, it's going to completely implode. However, they're also dealing with issues above lawsuits by former students and employees who accuse the school of all of these things. And they just recently settled a civil suit with 12 women after they accused the school of fostering an unsafe environment and mishandling cases of sexual assault. So yeah, the the private Christian University at Lynchburg, Virginia, maybe not the safest campus to go to.",subjective,campus

That's an honor. When you go to the gym. For example, this wouldn't be a lot of... Dress code! You would get dressed coded and kicked out of the gym because you're showing your mid-dirt! No, a bad draft. You cannot drink alcohol in or outside of the university. Even if you're 21. Even if you're at home with your family and you're 21. You cannot drink alcohol while you are involved in the university. Or else you get called on the Liberty University Police Department. It can't solve! Get married. So we do have a culture called Ring By Spring. Am I precious roommates? I asked me to talk about this because they're probably going to be married next year at the age of 20. So the Ring By Spring culture is that you literally get married while you're going to school there. Like fresh man of roles. Oh, that's not a rule but that's how it's done.

In case you're unfamiliar, Liberty University is by far the biggest and most influential Christian college in the nation. It was founded by the famous pastor Jerry Falwell and has grown to be one of the most prominent Christian organizations in the country. The Clary Act is a law that requires colleges and universities that receive federal funding to collect data on campus crime and notify students of threats. Schools must disseminate an annual security report that includes crime reports and information to improve campus safety. And as the article says, Liberty has marketed itself for years as having one of the safest campuses in the nation with 15,000 students enrolled in the school in Lynchburg. Its police department had one single officer with little to no oversight investigating all crimes for just under a decade for 15,000 students plus residents plus faculty. And the U.S. Department of Education said it identified numerous cases that resulted in misclassification or underreporting of crimes. Instead of just underreporting crimes or trying to hide sexual crimes, many victims of sexual crimes feared reporting because of concerns of reprisal. The final program review stated several were punished for violating the student cone of conduct known as the Liberty Way while there are salents were left unpunished. There's a story up here. I'm not going to get into too much of the details up, but it's it's basically that, but I'm not going to read it for you here on TikTok. It's a little nasty. Consequently, many victims of sexual assault felt dissuaded by Liberty administration's reputation for punishing sexual assault survivors rather than helping them. Such fears created a culture of silence where sexual assaults commonly went unreported at Liberty University. Liberty University has admitted some fault here, paying the fines, they're cooperating, they're trying to clean this up. And I think one of the main reasons they're doing that is because they don't want the university to get a bad reputation. If a Christian college gets a reputation for being a rape school, it's going to completely implode. However, they're also dealing with issues above lawsuits by former students and employees who accuse the school of all of these things. And they just recently settled a civil suit with 12 women after they accused the school of fostering an unsafe environment and mishandling cases of sexual assault. So yeah, the the private Christian University at Lynchburg, Virginia, maybe not the safest campus to go to.",subjective,campus

Even though you haven't committed any crime or been formally charged with one, you are repeatedly questioned about your political views, accused of disloyalty, and asked to incriminate your friends and associates. If you don't cooperate, you risk jail or losing your job. This is exactly what happened in the United States in the 1950s, as part of a campaign to expose suspected communists. Named after its most notorious practitioner, the phenomenon known as McCarthyism destroyed thousands of lives and careers. For over a decade, American political leaders trampled democratic freedoms in the name of protecting them. During the 1930s and 1940s, there had been an active but small communist party in the United States. Its record was mixed. While it played crucial roles in wider progressive struggles for labor and civil rights, it also supported the Soviet Union. From the start, the American Communist Party faced attacks from conservatives and business leaders, as well as from liberals who criticized its ties to the oppressive Soviet regime. In World War II, when the USA and USSR were allied against Hitler, some American communists actually spied for the Russians. When the Cold War escalated and this espionage became known, domestic communism came to be seen as a threat to national security. But the attempt to eliminate that threat soon turned into the longest-lasting and most widespread episode of political repression in American history. Bird on by a network of bureaucrats, politicians, journalists, and businessmen, the campaign wildly exaggerated the danger of communist subversion. The people behind it harassed anyone suspected of holding left-of-center political views or associating with those who did. If you hung modern art on your walls, had a multiracial social circle, or signed petitions against nuclear weapons, you might just have been a communist. Following in the late 1940s, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover used the resources of his agency to hunt down such supposed communists and eliminate them from any position of influence with an American society. And the narrow criteria that Hoover and his allies used to screen federal employees spread to the rest of the country. Soon, Hollywood studios, universities, car manufacturers, and thousands of other public and private employers were imposing the same political tests on the men and women who worked for them. Meanwhile, Congress conducted its own witch hunt, subpoenaing hundreds of people to testify before investigative bodies like the House Un-American Activities Committee. If they refused to cooperate, they could be jailed for contempt, or more commonly fired and blacklisted. Obitious politicians like Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy used such hearings as a partisan weapon, accusing Democrats of being soft on communism and deliberately losing China to the communist block. McCarthy, a Republican senator from Wisconsin, became notorious by flaunting ever-changing lists of alleged communists within the State Department. Meg Don by other politicians, he continued to make outrageous accusations while distorting or fabricating evidence. Many citizens reviled McCarthy while others praised him. And when the Korean War broke out, McCarthy seemed vindicated. Once he became chair of the Senate's permanent subcommittee on investigations in 1953, McCarthy's recklessness increased. It was his investigation of the army that finally turned public opinion against him and diminished his power. McCarthy's colleagues in the Senate censured him, and he died less than three years later, probably from alcoholism. McCarthyism ended as well. It had ruined hundreds if not thousands of lives and drastically narrowed the American political spectrum. Its damage to democratic institutions would be long-lasting. In all likelihood, there were both Democrats and Republicans who knew that the anti-communist purges were deeply unjust, but feared that directly opposing them would hurt their careers. Even the Supreme Court failed to stop the witch hunt, condoning serious violations of constitutional rights in the name of national security. Was domestic communism an actual threat to the American government? Perhaps, though a small one. But the reaction to it was so extreme that it caused far more damage than the threat itself. And if new demagogues appeared in uncertain times to attack unpopular minorities in the name of patriotism, could it all happen again?",subjective,political rep

Even though you haven't committed any crime or been formally charged with one, you are repeatedly questioned about your political views, accused of disloyalty, and asked to incriminate your friends and associates. If you don't cooperate, you risk jail or losing your job. This is exactly what happened in the United States in the 1950s, as part of a campaign to expose suspected communists. Named after its most notorious practitioner, the phenomenon known as McCarthyism destroyed thousands of lives and careers. For over a decade, American political leaders trampled democratic freedoms in the name of protecting them. During the 1930s and 1940s, there had been an active but small communist party in the United States. Its record was mixed. While it played crucial roles in wider progressive struggles for labor and civil rights, it also supported the Soviet Union. From the start, the American Communist Party faced attacks from conservatives and business leaders, as well as from liberals who criticized its ties to the oppressive Soviet regime. In World War II, when the USA and USSR were allied against Hitler, some American communists actually spied for the Russians. When the Cold War escalated and this espionage became known, domestic communism came to be seen as a threat to national security. But the attempt to eliminate that threat soon turned into the longest-lasting and most widespread episode of political repression in American history. Bird on by a network of bureaucrats, politicians, journalists, and businessmen, the campaign wildly exaggerated the danger of communist subversion. The people behind it harassed anyone suspected of holding left-of-center political views or associating with those who did. If you hung modern art on your walls, had a multiracial social circle, or signed petitions against nuclear weapons, you might just have been a communist. Following in the late 1940s, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover used the resources of his agency to hunt down such supposed communists and eliminate them from any position of influence with an American society. And the narrow criteria that Hoover and his allies used to screen federal employees spread to the rest of the country. Soon, Hollywood studios, universities, car manufacturers, and thousands of other public and private employers were imposing the same political tests on the men and women who worked for them. Meanwhile, Congress conducted its own witch hunt, subpoenaing hundreds of people to testify before investigative bodies like the House Un-American Activities Committee. If they refused to cooperate, they could be jailed for contempt, or more commonly fired and blacklisted. Obitious politicians like Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy used such hearings as a partisan weapon, accusing Democrats of being soft on communism and deliberately losing China to the communist block. McCarthy, a Republican senator from Wisconsin, became notorious by flaunting ever-changing lists of alleged communists within the State Department. Meg Don by other politicians, he continued to make outrageous accusations while distorting or fabricating evidence. Many citizens reviled McCarthy while others praised him. And when the Korean War broke out, McCarthy seemed vindicated. Once he became chair of the Senate's permanent subcommittee on investigations in 1953, McCarthy's recklessness increased. It was his investigation of the army that finally turned public opinion against him and diminished his power. McCarthy's colleagues in the Senate censured him, and he died less than three years later, probably from alcoholism. McCarthyism ended as well. It had ruined hundreds if not thousands of lives and drastically narrowed the American political spectrum. Its damage to democratic institutions would be long-lasting. In all likelihood, there were both Democrats and Republicans who knew that the anti-communist purges were deeply unjust, but feared that directly opposing them would hurt their careers. Even the Supreme Court failed to stop the witch hunt, condoning serious violations of constitutional rights in the name of national security. Was domestic communism an actual threat to the American government? Perhaps, though a small one. But the reaction to it was so extreme that it caused far more damage than the threat itself.

The era saw aggressive investigations and hearings led by McCarthy himself, as chairman of the Senate's Subcommittee on Investigations, and by other entities such as the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). The methods employed during this period were often controversial, involving guilt by association, unsubstantiated accusations, and attacks on the character of individuals without sufficient evidence. Many careers and lives were ruined as a result of McCarthy‚Äôs and others‚Äô actions, with people in government, academia, the entertainment industry, and other fields being blacklisted or otherwise penalized on often flimsy or nonexistent evidence of communist affiliations. McCarthyism came to an end in the mid-1950s, particularly after the televised Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954, which exposed McCarthy's tactics to the public and led to his censure by the United States Senate later that year. Despite the end of McCarthy's influence, the era remains a cautionary tale about the dangers of political persecution and the importance of due process and civil liberties.

So I'm gonna be reading it so I'm probably not gonna be making any eye contact with my phone. Anyways, a first part of it goes over that bill that equated anti-zainism and anti-semitism. And when that was going through, like my initially I thought like this is what our Congress is spending time on right now like definitions and semantics.

So anyways one of the things that was interesting was when they're talking about this bill that basically was saying anything anti-zainism is anti-semitic. One thing that passed I was one thing that they said that was interesting is that only the day before democratic rep, Jerry Nadler of New York who is a staunch supporter of Israel and a pillar of the American Jewish community made a speech on the House floor clarifying that anti-zainism is a position that Jews have held as long as some of their fellows have embraced Zionism. He noted but the religious objections including that of the largest Hatsidic sect in the world the Sathomar as well as a long tradition of labor activists and others that could reduce who had and have political objections to Zionism. However when the bill did come up for vote Nadler like 91 other Democrats voted present on the bill. So I know apparently 95 Democrats voted yes only 13 Democrats voted no. So anyways the whole point of the bill was defining anti-zainism as anti-semitism but this is now setting it up for another bill okay so let me get to that part. So this bill is HR 6578 and it is titled quote to establish the Commission to study acts of anti-semitism in the United States and here's another quote attributed to Lara Friedman says the intention of the bill is quote exclusively to target criticism of Israel and Zionism. This is clear from the where-as clauses which are 100% about October 7th and its aftermath and from the press release. So it says there is already a well-known presidential initiative to combat anti-semitism that was presented with great fanfare and widespread approval. The bill itself makes no mention of the white nationalism that is a source of the overwhelming majority of anti-semitism but focuses exclusively on incidents since October. Both the bill itself and the comments in the press release that announced a focus entirely on support for Palestinians as anti-semitism. So it's ignoring like white supremacy groups and such it is focused on anyone who's propostive. Then it goes on to say in case it goes any doubt about the legitimacy of this Commission Congress hopes to create a clause in the bill that bars any witness a peanut for the commission from invoking their fifth amendment right to avoid self-incomination. That is particularly problematic in an atmosphere where criticism of Israel is corining toward being categorized as hate speech. Anti-semitism in this bill is defined even more loosely than the one in the House passed Tuesday. So in this act of the term anti-semitism means a certain perception of Jews which may be expressed as and then it defines these in these qualities. So number one is hatred towards Jews and two by rhetorical and physical manifestations directed to where and then has these subcategories.

So now this whole thing where it says a certain perception of Jews is white open to interpretation.

Like I said, you know, bydance has owns Chinese businesses and they operate in China. You don't know how many, but you acknowledge many must be card-carrying members of the CCP, use this data to influence narratives and trends, create misinformation, campaigns, encourage self-destructive behavior, purposely allow drug cartels to communicate freely and organize human and drug trafficking, and to be fair all social media companies could do that.

No. Okay, I thought you'd say that. I disagree, as you thought I might say. Here's why I disagree. You have to share data with Bydance. If the CCP says, hey, Bydance, you're going to do what we say.

They can encourage you to engage in behavior that will destroy your life. Even if it is not happening yet, it could in the future. The long-term goal of the Chinese Communist Party is the demise of the American power and that starts with our youth. At any moment, they could demand that all of TikTok's data be used to design an AI algorithm with the sole purpose of promoting Chinese interests and destroying our society from within.

Named after its most notorious practitioner, the phenomenon known as McCarthyism destroyed thousands of lives and careers. For over a decade, American political leaders trampled democratic freedoms in the name of protecting them. During the 1930s and 1940s, there had been an active but small communist party in the United States. Its record was mixed. While it played crucial roles in wider progressive struggles for labor and civil rights, it also supported the Soviet Union. From the start, the American Communist Party faced attacks from conservatives and business leaders, as well as from liberals who criticized its ties to the oppressive Soviet regime. In World War II, when the USA and USSR were allied against Hitler, some American communists actually spied for the Russians. When the Cold War escalated and this espionage became known, domestic communism came to be seen as a threat to national security. But the attempt to eliminate that threat soon turned into the longest-lasting and most widespread episode of political repression in American history. Bird on by a network of bureaucrats, politicians, journalists, and businessmen, the campaign wildly exaggerated the danger of communist subversion. The people behind it harassed anyone suspected of holding left-of-center political views or associating with those who did. If you hung modern art on your walls, had a multiracial social circle, or signed petitions against nuclear weapons, you might just have been a communist. Following in the late 1940s, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover used the resources of his agency to hunt down such supposed communists and eliminate them from any position of influence with an American society. And the narrow criteria that Hoover and his allies used to screen federal employees spread to the rest of the country. Soon, Hollywood studios, universities, car manufacturers, and thousands of other public and private employers were imposing the same political tests on the men and women who worked for them. Meanwhile, Congress conducted its own witch hunt, subpoenaing hundreds of people to testify before investigative bodies like the House Un-American Activities Committee. If they refused to cooperate, they could be jailed for contempt, or more commonly fired and blacklisted. Obitious politicians like Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy used such hearings as a partisan weapon, accusing Democrats of being soft on communism and deliberately losing China to the communist block. McCarthy, a Republican senator from Wisconsin, became notorious by flaunting ever-changing lists of alleged communists within the State Department. Meg Don by other politicians, he continued to make outrageous accusations while distorting or fabricating evidence. Many citizens reviled McCarthy while others praised him. And when the Korean War broke out, McCarthy seemed vindicated. Once he became chair of the Senate's permanent subcommittee on investigations in 1953, McCarthy's recklessness increased. It was his investigation of the army that finally turned public opinion against him and diminished his power. McCarthy's colleagues in the Senate censured him, and he died less than three years later, probably from alcoholism. McCarthyism ended as well. It had ruined hundreds if not thousands of lives and drastically narrowed the American political spectrum. Its damage to democratic institutions would be long-lasting. In all likelihood, there were both Democrats and Republicans who knew that the anti-communist purges were deeply unjust, but feared that directly opposing them would hurt their careers. Even the Supreme Court failed to stop the witch hunt, condoning serious violations of constitutional rights in the name of national security. Was domestic communism an actual threat to the American government? Perhaps, though a small one. But the reaction to it was so extreme that it caused far more damage than the threat itself. And if new demagogues appeared in uncertain times to attack unpopular minorities in the name of patriotism, could it all happen again?",subjective,political rep

This is who the term is referring to Joseph McCarthy. He was a Republican senator from Wisconsin in 1950s and he had like one goal in his entire life and I was getting rid of communism in America and in his eyes everyone was a communist. I would probably accuse him first because I'm wearing a red t-shirt but he would accuse labor leaders, teachers, military officials and he would especially go after the Hollywood elite. Charlie Chaplin, he was a communist. And so was Lillian Helman, Dalton Turbo, Paul Robson and countless others. And a political climate of witch hunts against communists that McCarthy created did have real life consequences. Paul Robson was a prominent figure in the African-American community and he had his passport revoked just on the grounds of being accused for being a communist. It essentially ended his international career. And this is Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. They were executed in 1953 on the grounds of being communist spies. There was almost no evidence against them besides testimonies from people like Julius' brother-in-law David. So yeah, it got bad and of course those are only extreme cases but people in general lost friendships, jobs, marriages, they got blacklisted from certain communities all because of blameless accusations. But of course in 1993 my card is a bit of more than he can chew when he started to hunting non-communists in the army. The army did not take kindly to that. The army started pushing back and this led to the army McCarthy hearings in 1954. That was televised for millions of Americans to see exactly what type of tactics McCarthy used when he was making his accusations. They also saw the army officials and their chief counsel Joseph Welch respond to accusations in a calm and composed manner. This led to the public seeing McCarthy more as a bully and the Senate then voted to censure his conduct for being opposed to senatorial traditions.

And this loyalty oath was a direct reaction to the Red Scar, aka the sphere of communism infiltrating America. Instead she went to work at a youth center to teach theater and at this youth center several of the board members were listed as communists by the government. So one thing led to another and she decided to put on a Elizabethan County fair that was part educational and part theatrical for her theater students to take part in. This went so well that they decided to do it again next year but bigger and so on and so on with it growing.

The era saw aggressive investigations and hearings led by McCarthy himself, as chairman of the Senate's Subcommittee on Investigations, and by other entities such as the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). The methods employed during this period were often controversial, involving guilt by association, unsubstantiated accusations, and attacks on the character of individuals without sufficient evidence. Many careers and lives were ruined as a result of McCarthy‚Äôs and others‚Äô actions, with people in government, academia, the entertainment industry, and other fields being blacklisted or otherwise penalized on often flimsy or nonexistent evidence of communist affiliations. McCarthyism came to an end in the mid-1950s, particularly after the televised Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954, which exposed McCarthy's tactics to the public and led to his censure by the United States Senate later that year.

Today's hearing is focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion and its impact on the Department of Defense and the Armed Services. I want to thank our witnesses for being with us today. I hope this hearing provides the opportunity for our members to have a productive exchange with our witnesses and provide answers to their questions. Let me set the stage by saying the military services continue to be one of the most merit-cratic organizations in the United States of America. Thanks to the principles established by President Truman in Executive Order 9981, that there shall be equal treatment and opportunity for all persons in the Armed Services without regard to race, color, religion, or national origin. These principles enabled me a working-class kid from Indiana to be the first of my family to go to college and later joined the Navy Reserves and served my country in uniform. That is what meritocracy provides, an opportunity for everyone, regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, or gender, to raise your right hand to serve your country and to succeed on hard work and determination alone. And that is why I've what I found in the Navy. No evidence of widespread racism, just sailors of every color background of religion, working hard to get the mission done. But we are now in danger of losing those merit-cratic principles to the politicization of our armed forces. Thanks first and foremost to the ever-expanding bureaucracy of diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, regulations, and trainings. This DEI apparatus is based in faulty science and misguided principles. In fact, anti-biased training efforts may be, quote, having literally any effect, including to actually increase bias. In a review of 418 prejudice reduction experiments, Elizabeth Levy Palak and her co-authors concluded that much of the anti-basis training is, quote, misguided. And even in the few studies that showed any effect at all of reducing bias, those effects actually disappeared over a short period of time. Yet the Department of Defense and the services have embraced DEI training full cloth without empirical evidence. And worse, they very well may be increasing racism and division in our military. This comes at a time when existential threats from China and Russia have never been as pronounced as what they are. And at a time when recruiting struggles, put our all-volunteer force on the brink. With these looming threats, we must emphasize the readiness of our armed forces. In a response to then-ranking member Senator James Inhoff of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Chairman Milley reported that DOD expended $359,311 man hours for Secretary Austin's extremism stand-down, and an additional 529,711 man hours for DEI-specific training. That is a lot of training hours spent away from honing, war fighting capabilities, knowledge and skills. Chairman Control the military is the bedrock of our system, and avoiding partisan political ideology is essential to the strength and viability of our military. Chairman Milley crossed the line during an armed services committee hearing in the summer of 2021. He testified that it's important to study critical race theory because, quote, I want to understand the white rage. What is it that made thousands of people assault this building and try to overturn the constitution of the United States of America, end quote? The highest-ranking military officer in our armed forces interrupted the Secretary of Defense, connected racism to the Capitol riot, all to score partisan political points while wearing the uniform. And we be surprised by the erosion of trust between the administration and our service members, or between our military and the American public. This cannot continue. Our service members and our nation deserve a military that does not make ideological judgments. I agree with Secretary Austin, who testified in the same hearing that all service members and DOD civilians, quote, deserve an environment free of discrimination, hate, and harassment. I want us to work together to develop a system that remains true to our meritocratic values that ensures the performance of all service members provide opportunity, not because of the color of their skin or the God that they pray to, but because they have worked hard and identify as soldiers, sailors, Marines, airmen, and guardians. This is very personal for me. I was the product of a meritocratic system that afforded a boy from Indiana an opportunity to go to college and serve my country in uniform later and now to become a member of Congress. And I want to make sure that we do everything we can to preserve that system, the American system. That is a difficult topic with passionate voices all around, not because we hate each other but because we all want what is best for our country and the men and women in uniform. Before hearing from our witnesses, let me offer ranking member Kim an opportunity to make any opening remarks.",subjective,military diversity

And my last job we planned to release a report on aerospace and defense in the year 2050, and I wanted to do it at South by Southwest, the nation's largest technology and innovation festival. To reach that type of educated creative workforce at South by, we needed to compete for attention with consumer facing brands that often spent millions to launch their products or TV shows. I thought we could get noticed by giving away cool swag alongside the report, and my idea was branded socks. We spent some time debating the color of the socks, the logo, and just how many to order. And just before finalizing the plan, a young woman in my team came in and asked if she could speak to me privately. She confided, Alex, you know women don't really wear crew socks. I asked, well, what do they wear? And she responded, ankle socks. It never occurred to me to order any other kind of socks than the kind that I was familiar with. Her suggestion had merit and we ended up ordering half ankle and half crew socks. Of course, the socks were a hit. But what was telling was that demand for the ankle socks by both women and men was higher than for the crew socks and substantially so. Our entire project was more effective because a woman on my team was comfortable sharing her perspective with a pretty opinionated mailbox and that I was open to that input. Intentionally, building a diverse team and then creating an environment where everyone feels like their voices are valued and heard is not only the right thing to do, but it gets you better outcomes. Given the Daff's high-stake mission, we need every tool available to defend the nation and our interests and maximizing the talents and unleashing the problem-sconce-solving skills of all of our people.

Tom Cruise's agent, Mahadekio, almost lost her job as an agent, but she did get fired as co-chief of Motion Pictures Department. A lot of people are currently comparing it to the McCarthyist era of the Cold War and the Hollywood Blacklist, but what does this mean? During the Cold War, the Hollywood Blacklist was designed to keep people out of the film industry, whether they deemed them to be communist or sympathising to the cause. It was tied with the House Committee of Un-American Activities, and it was originally designed to stop the spread of fascism. So 10 Hollywood figures, otherwise known as the Hollywood Ten, were called out for their ties to communism. They were imprisoned, and after they were released, they were blacklisted. It wasn't just these ten, anyone who had affiliations with them were them barred from the film and entertainment industry. Thousands of people who had affiliations or connections suffered setbacks to their careers. This suffocated creativity, it eliminated countless artists, and it changed Hollywood forever. It's Hollywood's collective desire to do what's best for the studios, and they'd rather leave collectives hanging dry. Think about what the WGA and SAG after it was striking for. The workers have always been the sharpest thorn in the side of studio execs. The execs don't want to potentially disrupt their bottom line and alienate movie goers. And since the Hollywood Blacklist, the anti-leftist sentiment continues in Hollywood and America today. Back then, any impact on an individual American was deemed irrelevant in the face of fighting the great threat of Russia or communism. But now instead of communism, replace it with being scared of saying words like genocide. This is why so many celebrities are scared to speak out. There is a concerted effort to punish anybody that speaks out about this ethnostate. Hollywood is willing to uphold their status quo in any way that they can. To maintain their imperial media hegemony, keep profiting and not disrupt their bottom line, and most of all, to continue their narrative to manufacture consent and justify their actions on their involvement in Palestine. Solidarity to everyone who's willing to put themselves on the line for this, and to speak up about these atrocities.",subjective,hollywood

Let me set the stage by saying the military services continue to be one of the most merit-cratic organizations in the United States of America. Thanks to the principles established by President Truman in Executive Order 9981, that there shall be equal treatment and opportunity for all persons in the Armed Services without regard to race, color, religion, or national origin. These principles enabled me a working-class kid from Indiana to be the first of my family to go to college and later joined the Navy Reserves and served my country in uniform. That is what meritocracy provides, an opportunity for everyone, regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, or gender, to raise your right hand to serve your country and to succeed on hard work and determination alone. And that is why I've what I found in the Navy. No evidence of widespread racism, just sailors of every color background of religion, working hard to get the mission done. But we are now in danger of losing those merit-cratic principles to the politicization of our armed forces. Thanks first and foremost to the ever-expanding bureaucracy of diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, regulations, and trainings. This DEI apparatus is based in faulty science and misguided principles. In fact, anti-biased training efforts may be, quote, having literally any effect, including to actually increase bias. In a review of 418 prejudice reduction experiments, Elizabeth Levy Palak and her co-authors concluded that much of the anti-basis training is, quote, misguided. And even in the few studies that showed any effect at all of reducing bias, those effects actually disappeared over a short period of time. Yet the Department of Defense and the services have embraced DEI training full cloth without empirical evidence. And worse, they very well may be increasing racism and division in our military. This comes at a time when existential threats from China and Russia have never been as pronounced as what they are. And at a time when recruiting struggles, put our all-volunteer force on the brink. With these looming threats, we must emphasize the readiness of our armed forces. In a response to then-ranking member Senator James Inhoff of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Chairman Milley reported that DOD expended $359,311 man hours for Secretary Austin's extremism stand-down, and an additional 529,711 man hours for DEI-specific training. That is a lot of training hours spent away from honing, war fighting capabilities, knowledge and skills. Chairman Control the military is the bedrock of our system, and avoiding partisan political ideology is essential to the strength and viability of our military. Chairman Milley crossed the line during an armed services committee hearing in the summer of 2021. He testified that it's important to study critical race theory because, quote, I want to understand the white rage. What is it that made thousands of people assault this building and try to overturn the constitution of the United States of America, end quote? The highest-ranking military officer in our armed forces interrupted the Secretary of Defense, connected racism to the Capitol riot, all to score partisan political points while wearing the uniform. And we be surprised by the erosion of trust between the administration and our service members, or between our military and the American public. This cannot continue. Our service members and our nation deserve a military that does not make ideological judgments. I agree with Secretary Austin, who testified in the same hearing that all service members and DOD civilians, quote, deserve an environment free of discrimination, hate, and harassment. I want us to work together to develop a system that remains true to our meritocratic values that ensures the performance of all service members provide opportunity, not because of the color of their skin or the God that they pray to, but because they have worked hard and identify as soldiers, sailors, Marines, airmen, and guardians. This is very personal for me. I was the product of a meritocratic system that afforded a boy from Indiana an opportunity to go to college and serve my country in uniform later and now to become a member of Congress. And I want to make sure that we do everything we can to preserve that system, the American system. That is a difficult topic with passionate voices all around, not because we hate each other but because we all want what is best for our country and the men and women in uniform. Before hearing from our witnesses, let me offer ranking member Kim an opportunity to make any opening remarks.",subjective,military diversity

The diversity of the U.S. Armed Forces is one of our greatest strengths, as a chief diversity and inclusion officer for the department. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are essential to unit cohesion and trust. A diverse and talented force of trained and cohesive teams is the most important indicator of our readiness. Intentional diversity and inclusion efforts allow us to tap into the full talents of the American people and then leverage those talents to defend the nation. Our diversity, inclusion, and initiatives are focused on talent acquisition and development and informed by science and business best practices. Congressional mandates, data-focused policy reviews and assessments, and the lived experiences of Airmen and Guardians working together every single day.

And my last job we planned to release a report on aerospace and defense in the year 2050, and I wanted to do it at South by Southwest, the nation's largest technology and innovation festival. To reach that type of educated creative workforce at South by, we needed to compete for attention with consumer facing brands that often spent millions to launch their products or TV shows. I thought we could get noticed by giving away cool swag alongside the report, and my idea was branded socks. We spent some time debating the color of the socks, the logo, and just how many to order. And just before finalizing the plan, a young woman in my team came in and asked if she could speak to me privately. She confided, Alex, you know women don't really wear crew socks. I asked, well, what do they wear? And she responded, ankle socks. It never occurred to me to order any other kind of socks than the kind that I was familiar with. Her suggestion had merit and we ended up ordering half ankle and half crew socks. Of course, the socks were a hit. But what was telling was that demand for the ankle socks by both women and men was higher than for the crew socks and substantially so. Our entire project was more effective because a woman on my team was comfortable sharing her perspective with a pretty opinionated mailbox and that I was open to that input. Intentionally, building a diverse team and then creating an environment where everyone feels like their voices are valued and heard is not only the right thing to do, but it gets you better outcomes. Given the Daff's high-stake mission, we need every tool available to defend the nation and our interests and maximizing the talents and unleashing the problem-sconce-solving skills of all of our people.

What does codacity mean? I have no idea, Congressman. You took six months to investigate one tweet. You didn't even figure out the words, Matt. I didn't investigate the thing. She's a DOD. Well, you said in a Fox North article that you were going to take 30 days and investigate it and it took you six months. In a six month investigation, you guys didn't learn what codacity meant? I think you know. I think every person that's going to watch this exchange knows you know. She's trying to lash audaciousness with someone being Caucasian, isn't she? I have no idea, Congressman. Wow. What an investigation. Well, I did not do the investigation. I will say I did not do the investigation. She is a GS employee that's employed by Dodia. Well, Dodia conducted the investigation. Gosh, the Pentagon told Fox News Digital that Gilsis Narrows would provide a final decision in 30 days. So they gave, so someone at the Pentagon is throwing your name out there as being responsible for this and now it looks foolish that you're suggesting you don't know what that means. Well, I would say that. Hold on. That quote in that comfort. Let's go to this, Mr. Narrows. What's a PD session? My guess would be personal development. Personal development. You don't think it's professional development? Another open matter for the investigation that it didn't resolve. So you don't know what codacity means. He's obviously talking about professional development there. And like when she says, I had to stop or let's go to the next claim. The codacity to say that black people can be racist too. Mr. Narrows, can black people be racist too? I've already stated, Congressman, that I didn't agree with her statements. But I'm asked about that. But I'm asked about that. Can black people be racist? This question is about me or my personal beliefs. But again, I don't. I don't know eating official over DEI. I don't agree. A racist person who works for you puts out these tweets. And you won't say whether you agree or disagree with me. I told you I said, Chairman, I don't remind members of the reserve standards of decorum and their statements. This is decorum. It's my time. Can black people be racist? I do not agree with that tweet. Do you agree with that statement? I'm asking you a statement. Can black people be racist? I'm not going to answer that, Congressman. Why not? Because it's you're asking me a personal opinion. And that's not what this is about. Actually, I'm asking you in your capacity as a senior DOD official in the Biden administration who is where we see recruiting falling off the table, whether or not the embrace of racist tweets, whether shuffling these people around rather than firing them, and whether this little exchange here is helping or hurting recruiting, let's go ahead and put up the recovery. I will tell you we do not support racist tweets. We do not support racism. Well, did you fire this lady? Again. You hired her? As I say, I did not hire her. As she was. You hired her? As it was stated earlier, she's a DOD employee. She's a GS employee. The inquiry that was done said these tweets were done on a personal matter. Oh, a personal matter. How do you know it's a personal matter? It was done on a personal matter. You don't know that the PD stands for professional development. And Mr. Cisneros, this is a professional development session where she attacked white colleagues and took the position that black people can't be racist. Now, you can't answer basic questions about it. And here's what I would propose to you. This is what we're looking at in recruiting right now. It's fallen off the table. And when you have employees that you don't fire who do racist things and say racist things, then you really hurt the ability to recruit people who want to be part of an inclusive and diverse force. I would say the data that we have is not, the recruiting is not falling off because of that. But again, the Department of Defense, DUDIA does not agree with the tweets that she made. It was in the re-adclostering the work day. You didn't fire her. If someone puts out racist things, do you fire them or do you just move them around? That was not an official. That was not an official. That's her own personal account. Here's the problem with the double standard, Mr. Cisneros, when Caucasian members of the military post about the Second Amendment or supporting building the wall, you all seem to be on a white supremacy snipe hunt. You seem to take people's personal views and weaponize them against them. And I've had people in my district to serve that wonder whether or not some joke that they forwarded or mean that they liked is going to result in the ruining of their careers. But you have no such interest when it's a person like this. You delayed the investigation. Your own name was what DOD put out is conducted the investigation. You delayed it. This lady makes like $160,000 a year. Do you really think today the taxpayer should be paying this lady that amount of money? The investigation was not conducted by me. That was never- But the Pentagon said it was you. I don't know who the Pentagon said that, but I will tell you it was a misstatement. Mr. Chairman, I seek to enter- The investigation was conducted by DOD because she's a DOD employee. If you just fired racist people, then maybe you wouldn't have to go through this. Mr. Chairman, I have a series of Units consent requests. Without objection. So first is Pentagon drags out decision after probe into woke diversity chief accused of anti-white people's tweets.

There's no feature of anything we've passed that exempts what we've given to Ukraine from those requirements in the arms control act, right? Not exempts their different provisions as to how that plays out, different circumstances. But that is controlling law, controlling policy. And here's the upshot. As you testify here today, you cannot testify truthfully under oath that the DOD has complied with the policy and law regarding end-use monitoring all times in this conflict, isn't that right? So I want to be careful here when I respond to you, Congressman, to make sure that I'm clear. We are conducting a series of evaluations that look at the controls that DOD has in place to ensure that they are taking the steps that are required. And I get all that. But here's the operative question. We haven't complied with end-use monitoring, according to the law, with everything we've sent to Ukraine to date, have we? So our 2020 report, which is our last public report on this, made a number of recommendations. All of those have been made. I know. I know, but you're sort of dodging the question. You cannot testify that we have complied with the end-use monitoring requirements at all times during this conflict, can you? So are we have an ongoing evaluation? I get that it's ongoing. I'm looking backwards. You cannot testify that everything is complied with the law in the end-use monitoring, can you? So some of that gets into the classified report that we should previously.

Today's hearing is focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion and its impact on the Department of Defense and the Armed Services. I want to thank our witnesses for being with us today. I hope this hearing provides the opportunity for our members to have a productive exchange with our witnesses and provide answers to their questions. Let me set the stage by saying the military services continue to be one of the most merit-cratic organizations in the United States of America. Thanks to the principles established by President Truman in Executive Order 9981, that there shall be equal treatment and opportunity for all persons in the Armed Services without regard to race, color, religion, or national origin. These principles enabled me a working-class kid from Indiana to be the first of my family to go to college and later joined the Navy Reserves and served my country in uniform. That is what meritocracy provides, an opportunity for everyone, regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, or gender, to raise your right hand to serve your country and to succeed on hard work and determination alone. And that is why I've what I found in the Navy. No evidence of widespread racism, just sailors of every color background of religion, working hard to get the mission done. But we are now in danger of losing those merit-cratic principles to the politicization of our armed forces. Thanks first and foremost to the ever-expanding bureaucracy of diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, regulations, and trainings. This DEI apparatus is based in faulty science and misguided principles. In fact, anti-biased training efforts may be, quote, having literally any effect, including to actually increase bias. In a review of 418 prejudice reduction experiments, Elizabeth Levy Palak and her co-authors concluded that much of the anti-basis training is, quote, misguided. And even in the few studies that showed any effect at all of reducing bias, those effects actually disappeared over a short period of time. Yet the Department of Defense and the services have embraced DEI training full cloth without empirical evidence. And worse, they very well may be increasing racism and division in our military. This comes at a time when existential threats from China and Russia have never been as pronounced as what they are. And at a time when recruiting struggles, put our all-volunteer force on the brink. With these looming threats, we must emphasize the readiness of our armed forces. In a response to then-ranking member Senator James Inhoff of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Chairman Milley reported that DOD expended $359,311 man hours for Secretary Austin's extremism stand-down, and an additional 529,711 man hours for DEI-specific training. That is a lot of training hours spent away from honing, war fighting capabilities, knowledge and skills. Chairman Control the military is the bedrock of our system, and avoiding partisan political ideology is essential to the strength and viability of our military. Chairman Milley crossed the line during an armed services committee hearing in the summer of 2021. He testified that it's important to study critical race theory because, quote, I want to understand the white rage. What is it that made thousands of people assault this building and try to overturn the constitution of the United States of America, end quote? The highest-ranking military officer in our armed forces interrupted the Secretary of Defense, connected racism to the Capitol riot, all to score partisan political points while wearing the uniform. And we be surprised by the erosion of trust between the administration and our service members, or between our military and the American public. This cannot continue. Our service members and our nation deserve a military that does not make ideological judgments. I agree with Secretary Austin, who testified in the same hearing that all service members and DOD civilians, quote, deserve an environment free of discrimination, hate, and harassment. I want us to work together to develop a system that remains true to our meritocratic values that ensures the performance of all service members provide opportunity, not because of the color of their skin or the God that they pray to, but because they have worked hard and identify as soldiers, sailors, Marines, airmen, and guardians. This is very personal for me. I was the product of a meritocratic system that afforded a boy from Indiana an opportunity to go to college and serve my country in uniform later and now to become a member of Congress. And I want to make sure that we do everything we can to preserve that system, the American system. That is a difficult topic with passionate voices all around, not because we hate each other but because we all want what is best for our country and the men and women in uniform. Before hearing from our witnesses, let me offer ranking member Kim an opportunity to make any opening remarks.",subjective,military diversity

And my last job we planned to release a report on aerospace and defense in the year 2050, and I wanted to do it at South by Southwest, the nation's largest technology and innovation festival. To reach that type of educated creative workforce at South by, we needed to compete for attention with consumer facing brands that often spent millions to launch their products or TV shows. I thought we could get noticed by giving away cool swag alongside the report, and my idea was branded socks. We spent some time debating the color of the socks, the logo, and just how many to order. And just before finalizing the plan, a young woman in my team came in and asked if she could speak to me privately. She confided, Alex, you know women don't really wear crew socks. I asked, well, what do they wear? And she responded, ankle socks. It never occurred to me to order any other kind of socks than the kind that I was familiar with. Her suggestion had merit and we ended up ordering half ankle and half crew socks. Of course, the socks were a hit. But what was telling was that demand for the ankle socks by both women and men was higher than for the crew socks and substantially so. Our entire project was more effective because a woman on my team was comfortable sharing her perspective with a pretty opinionated mailbox and that I was open to that input. Intentionally, building a diverse team and then creating an environment where everyone feels like their voices are valued and heard is not only the right thing to do, but it gets you better outcomes. Given the Daff's high-stake mission, we need every tool available to defend the nation and our interests and maximizing the talents and unleashing the problem-sconce-solving skills of all of our people.

Again, we did not handle this right, and I did not handle it right. If we want to talk about what's going on in national security and the greatest threats in national security, it's not that the Secretary of Defense screwed up and is cleaning up the mess. I wouldn't equate my going to the hospital and receiving treatment. And being capacitated as a Secretary here, yes, is going AWOL. And back in December, I should have promptly informed the president, my team in Congress, and the American people of my cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment. Again, we did not handle this right, and I did not handle it right. As you know, I apologize, including directly to the president, and I take full responsibility. I want to again make one thing very clear. At no time during my treatment or recovery were there any gaps in authorities, and there were no risk to the department's command and control. And from the time that I resumed my duties on January 5th, I fully participated in national security decision making on events in the Middle East, and about military operations in self defense to protect our troops and our facilities over there. Secretary, the reason we've asked you here today is not to discuss your health. We're here today to determine why the president was not immediately informed of your incapacitation. The timeline as we understand it is this. On the evening of January 1st, Secretary Austin was transported to the hospital via ambulance for complications stemming from a surgical procedure he had on December 22nd. On the afternoon of January 2nd, the secretary's authorities were transferred to Deputy Secretary Hicks without her even being informed as to why. On January 4th, three days after the secretary's hospitalization, Deputy Secretary Hicks and the president were first informed that Secretary Austin was in the hospital. On January 5th, Congress is informed of the secretary's hospitalization. It's totally unacceptable that it took three days to inform the president of the United States that the secretary of defense was in the hospital and not in control of the Pentagon. Who will be held accountable for this embarrassment? Again, I take full responsibility and we put measures in place to address the shortcomings. Are you surprised the president didn't call for your resignation? I'm surprised, but are you surprised that he didn't call for your resignation? The president has expressed full faith in confidence in me. So you're not surprised that he didn't call for your resignation? Is it typical that the president would go three days without talking to his secretary of defense? Is that typical or is that a regular posture? Do you usually go days without talking to the commander in the office? I mean, that can happen. It depends on whether or not the president is on travel. If I'm on travel, there are times when we do go days without direct communication. So the big issue for me here is either the president is that aloof or you are irrelevant? Which one is it, Mr. Secretary? That you would go three days without knowing that his secretary of defense is not on the job. It's neither. The president is not aloof. Was there any time during this process in the first days of January when you were in the hospital? Any time whatsoever when the deputy secretary wasn't in a position to fully carry out the responsibilities of the secretary of defense? She is legally and logistically positioned to assume the functions and she was your right in a position to be able to support the president as chief of staff as he made decisions. So, commander in chief. So, she always has secure communications with her just like me. And she has a situational awareness that that's needed to be able to make effective recommendations to the president. She working with the chairman of the joint chiefs and also the combat commander would propose options for the president in any situation. You said something very important. You said there was never a break in command and control. But yet the president of the United States was not aware that you were outside of the chain of the command. So, is the president not a part of this command and control? Don't you believe that the commander in chief and the sect of that is critical for command and control? He is clearly at the top of the chain in terms of command and control. But what's important is that we provide him with credible options that he can pursue to address any situation. And it would have happened in this case because... Except he was unaware. So, what's important is the president was unaware of this breakdown and command and control. And you were not there in terms of who he would come from. Hillary, I'm just sorry. What prevented you at that initial hospitalization, which was a planned procedure from telling the president, albeit privately, about your condition that you had cancer? As I said, you know, diagnosis of cancer is a very personal and deeply troubling issue. And it's one that quite frankly, you know, I described it as a gut punch. And again, I didn't want to burden the president with one of my personal issues. But I've also said that I didn't get this right. I should have informed him. I should have talked to him about it. And I have since talked to the president. I have apologized. And he responded with a warmth and empathy that anybody knows you'll buy. I have limited time. I'm sorry. You, I don't mean to be rude. You said you, or you just said you expect your organization in early questioning to do the right thing and notify higher. But when you initially went in, it was not your intent or expectation to notify higher. You didn't expect your organization to notify the president, correct? You know, as I said, I didn't get that right. And I, that was not done appropriately. I appreciate that, that canter. But just, just so I have clarity, your initial intent was to go in, have the procedure for there to be not any complications in the White House would be none the wiser in the process, correct? We, we, we didn't, I didn't instruct anybody to notify anyone. That's right. I will note that while we are spending our precious time, at least I think it's precious. On taking you and the administration to task, we are failing in our responsibility to fund the Department of Defense. We're now five months late in the appropriation process. It is the responsibility of the Congress to provide the appropriations and we are not doing so. We're on our fourth or fifth continuing resolution. We are derelict, not usur. It is the Congress of the United States and the leadership in this house that is failing to meet the national security needs of this nation. In the appropriation process, October, November, December, January and February have passed. And we've not done our work. And we're spending our time here taking you to task. That's wrong. We're failing. When a soldier goes AWOL, when they wear the uniform, when they put their lives on the line for our nation for you, what happens when they go AWOL? What is the punishment? I wouldn't equate my going to the hospital and receiving treatment. Being capacitated as a secretary here, yes, is going AWOL. So you don't equate. Disappearing being incapacitated with being AWOL. I didn't disappear. I was in a military hospital. You didn't tell your secretary. You just testified. You didn't tell your staff. Did you not? You just testified. What happens when a soldier goes AWOL? I have 20 seconds. What happens when they go AWOL? We have to realize that I have a fairly large, or they honorably are disonably discharged. They put into the break. What happens? Seriously, you're not even answering the questions. I'm not going to rest until someone we should not rest until someone is held accountable. Look, you made a mistake. You admitted it. You're taking steps to address it. And you want to know what accountability is. Accountability is having to come and sit in front of people and their outrage and their drama in public about your health issues. And the mistakes you've admitted you made when the entire world is wondering what the hell is going on with the United States of America. So, if we want to talk about what's going on in national security and the greatest threat to national security, it's not that the Secretary of Defense screwed up and is cleaning up the mess. The greatest threat to national security is the polarization of the country and the fact that we can't explain to the world who we are and what kind of leadership role we want.

Times just dropped a story. Under this headline, Mark Meadows has testified to Grand Jury in Special Counsel investigation of Trump. We will read from it, Mark Meadows, the final White House chief of staff under President Donald Trump and a potentially key figure. An inquiry is related to Trump has testified before a federal grand jury hearing evidence in the investigations being led by the Special Counsel's office that is according to two people briefed on the matter. Trump's is a figure in both of the two distinct lines of inquiry being pursued by the Special Counsel appointed to oversee the Justice Department's scrutiny of Trump. And, of course, Jack Smith, the Times goes on to report this. One inquiry is focused on Trump's efforts to cling to power after losing the 2020 election culminating in the attack by a pro-Trump mob on the Capitol. During congressional certification of the Electoral College results on January 6th, the other is an investigation into Trump's handling of hundreds of classified documents after he left office and whether he obstructed efforts to retrieve them.

In many ways, a perfunctory response, and it doesn't confirm anything, but in Trump's world where a loyalty is such an important thing, and anyone who turns on Trump is seen as disloyal or anyone following legal procedures, the scene is disloyal.

It starts with this documentary right here, raising the Allysor, the true story of a rare dinosaur, and the homeschooler who found it. That homeschooler? Mark Meadows' daughter. It follows a team of young homeschoolers, including Mark Meadows' 9-year-old daughter, as they're looking for dinosaurs that will prove the Earth is young and dinosaurs died in a worldwide flood, only a mere 6,000 years ago or so. Well, they're running out of time and they haven't found anything, so they decide to pray. And would you know it? Just after that, Mark Meadows' 9-year-old daughter finds the first fossil. Then they really hit the jackpot because over the next four days they were able to excavate an Allysor, a Stegosaurus, and a 120-foot-long sauropod. Now, that obviously didn't really happen, but it didn't stop them from marketing this to other kids as a true story. The reason, because in that documentary, they also are somehow able to prove, granted there is no evidence of this, except for some scripture, I believe, but they were able to prove that that dinosaur they found died in a worldwide flood, a mere 4-6,000 years ago. They're ended up being a lot of drama that you can read about online, and the creationist who actually dug up the Allysor came forward, admitting that he had dug it up.

New York Times reported seven minutes ago that Mark Meadows, he was Donald Trump's chief of staff at the end of the presidency when the documents were taken as well as on January 6th, as events also under investigation by Jack Smith. Times just dropped a story. Under this headline, Mark Meadows has testified to Grand Jury in Special Counsel investigation of Trump. We will read from it, Mark Meadows, the final White House chief of staff under President Donald Trump and a potentially key figure. An inquiry is related to Trump has testified before a federal grand jury hearing evidence in the investigations being led by the Special Counsel's office that is according to two people briefed on the matter. Trump's is a figure in both of the two distinct lines of inquiry being pursued by the Special Counsel appointed to oversee the Justice Department's scrutiny of Trump. And, of course, Jack Smith, the Times goes on to report this. One inquiry is focused on Trump's efforts to cling to power after losing the 2020 election culminating in the attack by a pro-Trump mob on the Capitol. During congressional certification of the Electoral College results on January 6th, the other is an investigation into Trump's handling of hundreds of classified documents after he left office and whether he obstructed efforts to retrieve them.

Mr. Meadows has maintained a commitment to tell the truth where he has a legal obligation to do so. In many ways, a perfunctory response, and it doesn't confirm anything, but in Trump's world where a loyalty is such an important thing, and anyone who turns on Trump is seen as disloyal or anyone following legal procedures, the scene is disloyal.

It starts with this documentary right here, raising the Allysor, the true story of a rare dinosaur, and the homeschooler who found it. That homeschooler? Mark Meadows' daughter. It follows a team of young homeschoolers, including Mark Meadows' 9-year-old daughter, as they're looking for dinosaurs that will prove the Earth is young and dinosaurs died in a worldwide flood, only a mere 6,000 years ago or so. Well, they're running out of time and they haven't found anything, so they decide to pray. And would you know it? Just after that, Mark Meadows' 9-year-old daughter finds the first fossil. Then they really hit the jackpot because over the next four days they were able to excavate an Allysor, a Stegosaurus, and a 120-foot-long sauropod. Now, that obviously didn't really happen, but it didn't stop them from marketing this to other kids as a true story. The reason, because in that documentary, they also are somehow able to prove, granted there is no evidence of this, except for some scripture, I believe, but they were able to prove that that dinosaur they found died in a worldwide flood, a mere 4-6,000 years ago. They're ended up being a lot of drama that you can read about online, and the creationist who actually dug up the Allysor came forward, admitting that he had dug it up. A few years previously, maybe a year or two, I don't remember the exact year, and then they had reburied it for this documentary.

To say, I was acting in an official capacity of the federal government when all of this was taking place. That's how he can get the case moved. But if he does that, then he has to testify. He has to take the stand and then allow cross-examination by Fanny Willis, which he is never going to do. He can't introduce that defense by saying I was acting in an official capacity, with him saying it has to come from an outside source. Is he going to get that? Probably not because he has to do all of this stuff and then meet with the judge on Monday. So when Monday comes, and he goes before the judge to the hearing that's already been set by the judge to say you have to come in, he's assumed response, meaning like the thing that's most likely to happen is for him to get that rejected. But should set a precedent for basically all of the other defendants. I'm not saying that it's going to happen that way. I'm just saying it's more likely than not, this is not going to get granted.

Now, one thing that I read in some of the reporting yesterday in this immunity deal news is that Mark Metta supposedly said that he never heard Donald Trump actually say that he knew the election was stolen. And this is important because this goes to Trump's defense. And I use air quotes for that because for a lot of these charges, it's really no defense at all. But Donald Trump's defense that, oh, I did, I really believed that the election was stolen. I really thought I won. Therefore, I didn't have the requisite intent for this crime. Now, number one, I've told you that's a bogus defense. It's actually no defense at all to most of these charges because whether or not you believed, whether or not Trump believed that he had won the election is completely irrelevant. Even if he thought he won the election, that doesn't give him a right to commit the crimes that he committed. Like, for example, obstructing an official proceeding of Congress, right?

New York Times reported seven minutes ago that Mark Meadows, he was Donald Trump's chief of staff at the end of the presidency when the documents were taken as well as on January 6th, as events also under investigation by Jack Smith. Times just dropped a story. Under this headline, Mark Meadows has testified to Grand Jury in Special Counsel investigation of Trump. We will read from it, Mark Meadows, the final White House chief of staff under President Donald Trump and a potentially key figure. An inquiry is related to Trump has testified before a federal grand jury hearing evidence in the investigations being led by the Special Counsel's office that is according to two people briefed on the matter. Trump's is a figure in both of the two distinct lines of inquiry being pursued by the Special Counsel appointed to oversee the Justice Department's scrutiny of Trump. And, of course, Jack Smith, the Times goes on to report this. One inquiry is focused on Trump's efforts to cling to power after losing the 2020 election culminating in the attack by a pro-Trump mob on the Capitol. During congressional certification of the Electoral College results on January 6th, the other is an investigation into Trump's handling of hundreds of classified documents after he left office and whether he obstructed efforts to retrieve them.

In many ways, a perfunctory response, and it doesn't confirm anything, but in Trump's world where a loyalty is such an important thing, and anyone who turns on Trump is seen as disloyal or anyone following legal procedures, the scene is disloyal.

It starts with this documentary right here, raising the Allysor, the true story of a rare dinosaur, and the homeschooler who found it. That homeschooler? Mark Meadows' daughter. It follows a team of young homeschoolers, including Mark Meadows' 9-year-old daughter, as they're looking for dinosaurs that will prove the Earth is young and dinosaurs died in a worldwide flood, only a mere 6,000 years ago or so. Well, they're running out of time and they haven't found anything, so they decide to pray. And would you know it? Just after that, Mark Meadows' 9-year-old daughter finds the first fossil. Then they really hit the jackpot because over the next four days they were able to excavate an Allysor, a Stegosaurus, and a 120-foot-long sauropod. Now, that obviously didn't really happen, but it didn't stop them from marketing this to other kids as a true story. The reason, because in that documentary, they also are somehow able to prove, granted there is no evidence of this, except for some scripture, I believe, but they were able to prove that that dinosaur they found died in a worldwide flood, a mere 4-6,000 years ago. They're ended up being a lot of drama that you can read about online, and the creationist who actually dug up the Allysor came forward, admitting that he had dug it up. A few years previously, maybe a year or two, I don't remember the exact year, and then they had reburied it for this documentary.

To say, I was acting in an official capacity of the federal government when all of this was taking place. That's how he can get the case moved. But if he does that, then he has to testify. He has to take the stand and then allow cross-examination by Fanny Willis, which he is never going to do. He can't introduce that defense by saying I was acting in an official capacity, with him saying it has to come from an outside source. Is he going to get that? Probably not because he has to do all of this stuff and then meet with the judge on Monday. So when Monday comes, and he goes before the judge to the hearing that's already been set by the judge to say you have to come in, he's assumed response, meaning like the thing that's most likely to happen is for him to get that rejected. But should set a precedent for basically all of the other defendants. I'm not saying that it's going to happen that way. I'm just saying it's more likely than not, this is not going to get granted.

Mark Meadows. Now we have learned that Mark Meadows has cut a deal with the special counsel, Jack Smith, to testify against Donald Trump in exchange for a grant of immunity. Now, I don't know the complete contours of that agreement. What exactly it means for Mark Meadows and possible criminal charges against him in the future at the federal level.

Now, one thing that I read in some of the reporting yesterday in this immunity deal news is that Mark Metta supposedly said that he never heard Donald Trump actually say that he knew the election was stolen. And this is important because this goes to Trump's defense. And I use air quotes for that because for a lot of these charges, it's really no defense at all. But Donald Trump's defense that, oh, I did, I really believed that the election was stolen. I really thought I won. Therefore, I didn't have the requisite intent for this crime. Now, number one, I've told you that's a bogus defense. It's actually no defense at all to most of these charges because whether or not you believed, whether or not Trump believed that he had won the election is completely irrelevant.

You could even see some of them grasping at even further stretching conspiracy theories. You know, like maybe it was China, maybe it was this, maybe it was that. But I mean, we already knew that. Everybody's saying that that's the shocking part. To me, what's new is how much malice was proven in those texts. The aftermath texts. Like the During the January 6th texts, the aftermath texts, where people were texting Mark Meadows and asking him, we should spin it like this. We should spin it like that. We should spin it like this. There was an active cover up going on, which proves malice. It proves the intent of what they wanted to do. It also proves motive. It proves they actually wanted it to happen the way they tried to make it happen. And they knew what they were doing was wrong. It proves malice and motive. There's like, I've said a couple of times when talking about law. And particularly when you're talking about rich people with very expensive lawyers and politicians trying to prove corruption, that the hardest things to do and why a lot of these people don't get charged because a lot of these laws have attached to it and malice, intent, motive, things that are very difficult to prove. These texts do that. They prove intent. They prove motive. They prove malice. So this is the smoking gun. This is what was very difficult legally to charge people with. And I'm pretty sure the Department of Justice has already had these texts, which is why those specific texts were kind of kept in the background. We know January 6 had those texts. The aftermath of their attempt to spin and cover up what their involvement in January 6 was proves that hard part of the law. Now the question is, is will they have the balls? Are they going to hide behind this whole, oh, well, it's going to look political. They're politicians. Of course it is. They still did legal stuff.",subjective,political corruption

So I'm sure the bulk of his testimony is about January 6th, as well as the 30 or 35 members of Congress who he was texting back and forth with in the days leading up to January 6th, about efforts to overturn the election, about January 6th itself, about their bullshit schemes on fake electors, on every... Mark Meadows was running all of these various conspiracies out of the Oval Office. For two or three solid months before Joe Biden's inauguration, Mark Meadows was at the center of every single one of them because he was the gatekeeper to Trump. I would imagine he has maybe some testimony to offer about the Mar-a-Lago documents. It would be my theory that Mark... Or that Jack Smith doesn't need anything from Mark Meadows relative to the Mar-a-Lago documents. He's got that thing locked down regardless of Mark Meadows. But as it relates to the six or seven different conspiracies that they were running out of the Oval Office to overturn the 2020 election results, Mark Meadows was at the center of every single one of those. He was working with John Eastman. He was working with the attorney that Trump wanted to install as acting attorney general. I can't remember that guy's name, the nerdy looking guy with the glasses going bald. And he testified twice in front of the grand jury. And there's no privilege between him and Trump. Trump, you know, Trump could try to assert, you know, like executive privilege or executive communication privilege, whatever that's called. I can't remember off the top of my head. But I know that's been litigated a bunch as well. Never from that, there's no privilege. Meadows was not his attorney.

My old account with almost 15,000 followers was recently permanently banned for posting this exact type of content so I'm gonna try to be careful and use my pig Latin. Up on the wall of shame today we have Richard Bailey Granger who is 40 years old, 40. He was currently living in Panama City and is in the Bay County jail awaiting extra diction to Alabama. He is charged with seven counts of essay against a child and one count of automisay. Remember your pig Latin for middle school. Helena Alabama Police Department started an investigation in December after a victim came forward with allegations of past abuse. That investigation went on for several months and a grand jury was presented with the information in August and handed down indictments. We're unsure how long Granger had been living in Florida but he was arrested in Panama City on fugitive from justice charges and will be extradited back to Alabama to face these charges. We don't know how old the child was, we do know that it was not a child from Helena Elementary School which is where Granger was a teacher formerly. This narrative of youth pastors being abusive has been going on since since at least I was you know in youth groups in the 90s and there always seems to be people that shove the information under the rug, people that protect them, people in the Christian community, in the church community that protect them. Tuesday of next week I'm actually going to be on Facebook Live interviewing and an adult lady who was abused in her youth group in the 90s. I grew up with this woman I believe every part of her story I would love to be able to do it on TikTok Live however I lost my following so I'm not yet eligible to do TikTok Lives.

So yesterday, Alabama House representatives passed House Bill 194, which is being campaigned by State Rep West Allen. If the bill becomes a law, then government officials won't be able to provide or receive funds from individuals or non-profit during campaign's or election. Now, you may be wondering why this matters or how this affects you. Until you take into consideration the type of candidates who need support from the community and from nonprofits. Mind you, this includes lecture seminars, meet and read some voter registrations, anything, having to do with voter outreach at all. We would then be left with the two options of either relying on a government to funny sort of events or for non-profits and individuals to host these types of events just on their own. Mind you, most non-profits are extremely underfunded, especially by the government. PSS be in no exception. Please donate. And honestly, if they were having these events before, why would they start having them now? Talking about individuals and non-profits cannot even donate to the campaign. It's a misdemeanor. You won't have jail if you want to support a candidate financially. At all so, again, think about it. Who actually needs the support from the people and who already has the money and the backing by the government? So this is what we can do to prevent this bill from becoming a bond. Basically, blow up your legislators. I'm going to drop all of their information for other than that. I'm going to put the effects information there too.

Well, Laura, since your father-in-law is about to install you into one of the most important GOP jobs in the entire country, let's take a quick look at your merits. You made the most terrifying cakes I've ever seen. You were a personal trainer and a producer over at Inside Edition. Then you married Eric Trump. And it just so happened, your father-in-law then decided to run for president and based off your extensive resume in all of your experience, they hired you to be their political surrogate on TV, where you then complained about people getting jobs. They supposedly weren't qualified for. She's an embarrassment. She was not chosen based on merit. She was chosen based on virtue signaling and pandering to get votes from women and minorities. Now, obviously, Donald Trump has no problem with installing his family loyalists into any official position. I don't express my views on policy. Our policies have created a pro-growth environment. So ensuring Laura as the co-chair for the Republican National Committee is not that surprising. But she's not even in the position yet and she's already promising to turn the RNC into a de facto Trump machine, giving the Trump family a whole new level of resource and reach. Every single penny will go to the number one and the only job of the RNC. That is electing Donald J. Trump as president of the United States. We have to ensure that every single penny of every dollar donated goes to the causes people care about. We are going to make sure that every single penny of every dollar raised goes towards one goal which is winning. And what exactly matters to the Trump camp? Now, the Merriam Webster Dictionary definition of merit is a person's qualities, actions, etc. regarded as indicating what the person deserves to receive. So I guess in some messed up way as the GOP turns into the MAGA party, Laura Trump has all the merit needed for the position, unyielding loyalty to Donald Trump.

You made the most terrifying cakes I've ever seen. You were a personal trainer and a producer over at Inside Edition. Then you married Eric Trump. And it just so happened, your father-in-law then decided to run for president and based off your extensive resume in all of your experience, they hired you to be their political surrogate on TV, where you then complained about people getting jobs. They supposedly weren't qualified for. She's an embarrassment. She was not chosen based on merit. She was chosen based on virtue signaling and pandering to get votes from women and minorities. Now, obviously, Donald Trump has no problem with installing his family loyalists into any official position. I don't express my views on policy. Our policies have created a pro-growth environment. So ensuring Laura as the co-chair for the Republican National Committee is not that surprising. But she's not even in the position yet and she's already promising to turn the RNC into a de facto Trump machine, giving the Trump family a whole new level of resource and reach. Every single penny will go to the number one and the only job of the RNC. That is electing Donald J. Trump as president of the United States. We have to ensure that every single penny of every dollar donated goes to the causes people care about. We are going to make sure that every single penny of every dollar raised goes towards one goal which is winning. And what exactly matters to the Trump camp? Now, the Merriam Webster Dictionary definition of merit is a person's qualities, actions, etc. regarded as indicating what the person deserves to receive. So I guess in some messed up way as the GOP turns into the MAGA party, Laura Trump has all the merit needed for the position, unyielding loyalty to Donald Trump.

Well, you just heard from the top law enforcement officer in the country, Mayor Garland, that he doesn't want voter ID anywhere, that he wants to basically give access as I just heard from him to anyone, whether they are legally able to vote or not. That is a huge problem. We have three pillars that we need to focus on at the RNC to ensure victory on November 5. We have to vote, protect the vote and raise money. But I would argue that maybe the most important of those three is protecting the vote. Election integrity. We have to ensure that when people go vote, they feel like their vote counts, that they are inspired to go vote. We can never allow what happened in 2020 and the question surrounding that election to ever happen again. So I'll tell you right now what is already underway at the RNC. We have for the first time ever an election integrity division. This means vast resources dedicated solely to this cause. We are going to have, and we've already started working on, and I'll tell you Monday, we're going to expand all of it, a nationwide network of volunteers, whether it's poll watchers, trained poll workers. These are people who can physically go in, count ballots that are coming in, know how many are coming in, how many are going out, volunteer and paid attorneys. If you are an attorney who wants to volunteer, we want you, DonaldJTrump.com, GOP.com. Please come volunteer. And we currently have 78 lawsuits out right now in 23 states across this country to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat. And here's what I want to say to anyone out there who is thinking about cheating and an election. We will go after you. You will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. It is not worth it. Every person in this country, Maria, whether you are Republican or Democrat, should want free, fair and transparent elections. That's what we're going to focus on. Well, look, you just heard A.G. Garland, you are going to be fighting up an uphill battle because they do not want voter IDs. He said he's going to vow to stop states that have voter IDs. And you have to question whether or not this is about the 10 million illegals who have come into this country on Joe Biden's watch. I had a friend the other day tell me she was standing at a food truck. Two gentlemen approached her. One had tattoos all over his face. They looked like illegals, she said. And one had a clipboard and he said to her, hello, miss, do you want to sign up to become a Democrat and vote? So you're talking about people that you want to hire, they're already doing that. And they may be doing it with illegals coming into this country. Yeah. Well, you do have to ask yourself, why would you not want something so basic like voter ID? And I think you're right. People say, why do we have a fully open Southern border? Why is it you're willing to allow fentanyl to pour over and kill 100,000 Americans a year? Why is it you're allowing 169 people on the terror watch list last fiscal year to come over? And I think the only thing people can figure is that the Democrats are bleeding and hemorrhaging voters. They understand that they cannot fool people in this country any longer. But they have to import people. And the only reason you wouldn't want voter ID is if you want people who cannot vote to vote in these elections. It is insane. But it's exactly the reason Maria, that this is our number one focus at the RNC.",subjective,election

Mark Green (R-TN), the committee‚Äôs chair, said in his opening statement. ‚ÄúThe actions and decision of Secretary Mayorkas have left us with no other option than to proceed with articles of impeachment.‚Äù   The first charge centers on the secretary‚Äôs implementation of two Biden administration policies: ‚Äúcatch and release,‚Äù which allows migrants apprehended at the border to be released into the homeland while they await legal proceedings; and humanitarian parole, a longstanding authority that allows border officials to let migrants into the country for special cases during emergencies or global unrest.   The second charge accuses Secretary Mayorkas of making false statements and failing to comply with congressional investigations into his actions. House Republicans say the secretary lied to Congress by claiming in 2022 that DHS had ‚Äúoperational control‚Äù of the border, and they accuse DHS of failing to fulfil 173 requests embedded in some 51 letters to the department.   ‚ÄúWe cannot allow this man to remain in office any longer,‚Äù Chair Green said. ‚ÄúThe time for accountability is now.‚Äù   House Democrats and the Homeland Security Department have pushed back on the charges, accusing Republicans of pursuing a politically motivated impeachment over disagreements about policy.   Many legal experts have also concluded that the charges laid out do not rise to the constitutional standard for impeachment: ‚ÄúTreason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.‚Äù   The committee is expected to approve the articles later Tuesday, sending them to the floor for a vote of the entire House, which could happen as soon as next week.

A meeting has been going on all day today of the House Homeland Security Committee. Lawmakers are preparing to take a final vote late tonight and if that vote is successful, which it's expected to be. Articles of impeachment for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorquez will be referred to the full House of Representatives for high crimes and misdemeanors. This is the first time in almost 150 years that the House has tried to remove a member of the president's cabinet through impeachment and wait till you hear the story of the last guy that went through it. He's a real peach. I'm gonna tell you about him in a second. But first, let's talk about Mayorquez. You may be wondering, what crimes or misdemeanors has he actually committed? Well, according to the draft articles of impeachment, Mayorquez will fully and systematically refuse to comply with federal immigration laws and he's guilty of breach of public trust by knowingly making false statements to Congress and obstructing the oversight of his department. Republican say Mayorquez is responsible for the chaos happening at the U.S. Mexico border and hasn't been following the laws. Secretary Mayorquez has testified in front of this very House committee several times and it's been, let's just say heated. Today, ahead of the committee's meeting, Mayorquez fired off this scathing six-page letter where he pushes back on the committee's claim that he's not enforcing immigration laws. He says that is false. He goes on to say this administration has actually removed or returned or expelled more migrants in three years than the prior administration did in four years. Then he lists all the actions the Homeland Security Department has taken at the border and all the actual numbers of migrant expulsions. His letter acknowledges that, yeah, the immigration system is broken, but Mayorquez says the only way to fix it is for Congress to pass some new legislation. He then goes on to say he's been working with that bipartisan group of senators to do just that. He's been part of that big border deal that I told you about in this video. It's a deal that the House speaker has said, even if it does pass the Senate, it's dead on arrival in the House. Republicans are now saying no new legislation is needed to correct what's happening at the border. So now what? Well, the committee will take a vote tonight to move the impeachment articles for Secretary Alejandro Mayorquez forward. Then it will go to the full House for a vote in the coming weeks, whether it will pass the House is a whole different story. So yeah, Republicans have the majority in the House, but as I told you in this video, because of the Republicans who are no longer in their seats, the House GOP has only a two vote margin. Obviously, no Democrats are going to vote for the impeachment of Alejandro Mayorquez. That means the House speaker can only lose two Republicans to no votes if he really wants this impeachment to pass. That is going to be tough. And even if it does somehow pass the House, the Senate will never convict him. Oh, and by the way, this is going to take weeks, weeks spent on this instead of other work. But if the Republicans are successful in this impeachment, it would be the first time in almost 150 years a cabinet secretary has been impeached. Now, this is the story I've been waiting to tell you. The last time this happened was May of 1876 when William Belknapp then wore Secretary for President Ulysses Grant was impeached by the House for corruption, apparently. He received $20,000 in kickbacks from a traitor that he awarded a government contract to. So how did Congress figure it out? Well, apparently, Belknapp wasn't hiding it. He loved to show off his wealth at parties he was hosting in Washington and both his first and second wives loved the luxury items. And we're always dressed to the nines. And people started to wonder how the hell was Belknapp affording such a lavish lifestyle and is $8,000 a year government salary. In the end, the Senate failed to convict Belknapp of the impeachment.

Republican say Mayorquez is responsible for the chaos happening at the U.S. Mexico border and hasn't been following the laws. Secretary Mayorquez has testified in front of this very House committee several times and it's been, let's just say heated. Today, ahead of the committee's meeting, Mayorquez fired off this scathing six-page letter where he pushes back on the committee's claim that he's not enforcing immigration laws. He says that is false. He goes on to say this administration has actually removed or returned or expelled more migrants in three years than the prior administration did in four years. Then he lists all the actions the Homeland Security Department has taken at the border and all the actual numbers of migrant expulsions. His letter acknowledges that, yeah, the immigration system is broken, but Mayorquez says the only way to fix it is for Congress to pass some new legislation. He then goes on to say he's been working with that bipartisan group of senators to do just that. He's been part of that big border deal that I told you about in this video. It's a deal that the House speaker has said, even if it does pass the Senate, it's dead on arrival in the House. Republicans are now saying no new legislation is needed to correct what's happening at the border. So now what?

No. You're saying not. Okay. Violence orchestrated by FBI sources or agents. That was Christopher A, the director of the FBI, who was appointed by Donald Trump. And as you can plainly see in here, he doesn't agree with the assertion that it was them. And play Higgins freaked out a little bit, didn't he? He didn't walk Christopher A to keep talking. He didn't want the narrative to get ruined. The narrative that Trump's support is of trying to create for quite some time, that it was the FBI. And they've been trying to do that with zero evidence. They pointed these interviews where the FBI's asked questions like, did you have informants in the crowd that day? And the FBI says, we're not telling you that shit. Because no law enforcement agency is going to reveal their investigative techniques, endanger their people during an ongoing investigation, especially one of the biggest criminal investigations in US history.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chief Ortiz, thank you for your service, Mr. Kagan, you as well. Chief, are you a direct report to the Secretary of Mayorka? There is a commissioner and a deputy commissioner in between the Secretary of myself. Do you communicate with him often? I communicate often with the Secretary several times a week, sir. So I want to piggyback off of what Mr. Green said, because we were just read in on this explosive device that was discovered by one of your board of patrol agents. Now obviously, sir, you're aware of this. How is it that you are not? Because as the investigative arm of the department, we're focused on investigating TCOs and the intelligence shared between our two agencies is robust. It happens all the time. The we're not actively. So here's my issue. This is one of the issues I see between the and I respect everything that both of you do and every way they're worked for you. But the breakdown of communication and the silos that we work in is what's detrimental to this country right now. And if there is an explosive device, if the cartels are using explosive device against our agents, that changes the narrative. So can I answer my job as the assistant director over a clear-ass. The transnational organized crime is not domestic operations. Our domestic operations folks that work in the field day in and day out are the ones that communicate with the board of patrol. I'm saying me personally, I do not know. I have I can get back to you and let you know whether HSI as a whole knows and our domestic operations knows. So I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you. So I would assume that the two individuals that you report to, sir, have reported to some Secretary Mayorkas about this explosive device, which tells me that Mayorkas is reported this to the president and nothing has been said or done to the American public and Congress was had no idea this was going on. Now if this is the case and we're surging money, billions, hundreds of billions of dollars across the seas to secure everybody else and we're not doing anything here in my state and our southern border, that's a problem because that means that they're lying to us. Response? I will tell you that if there's a significant event along the southwest border, whether it's a significant seizure or an arrest, we, I'm not talking about drugs anymore. I'm talking about explosives. Any significant event, whether it be a terrorist, whether it be a significant narcotics load, criminal alien high-value target, we will coordinate with our investigative partners and they vary in numbers, whether it's FBI, whether it's the DEA or our HSI partners. We all belong to joint terrorism task force. If it's associated with terrorism, every single one of us has an agent or a task force member. And so that information is shared amongst that group. It hasn't been shared with us, okay? And so here's my problem. If you share something of this nature with us, we can help, okay? Another question, Chief. You said consequences and you said that your agents don't feel like they have legislation or their legislation is not enforced to support them in their duties. Who specifically is telling you not to do that? What memo and whose name is on the bottom of that so we can go after them? When I say consequences, I'm talking about two things. I'm talking about prosecutions and I'm talking about repatriations back to their home country. We have to have those tools in our toolkit to be able to deal with the migrant surges that we're seeing right now. With respect to legislative changes or policy changes, that's out of my willhouse, Congressman. That is your responsibility. That's the administration's responsibility. My responsibility is to enforce the laws on the books and do everything I can to make sure our men and women have the tools that they need out there to do the job. Okay, so tell me right now which ones you need that are in place, that they're not being enforced a week so we can do something about that. And if you don't have that in front of you right now, please get it to me. I will. So I interrupt as the chairman just a second. I want to make sure I understand Mr. Lakshaw's questions. You're asking which policies need to be reinstated in order for him to do his job as a sur. Okay. Yes sir. I'm sorry if that didn't come out clearly. I thought it's okay. Go ahead Chief. Once again, whatever consequences you can call it, migrant protection protocols, you can call it remain in Mexico, you can call it a safe third country. All of the tools that the bourgeois and DHS have at their disposal are going to allow us to do a better job of managing this border. I yield back sir.",objective,border security

The respectfully Congressman, the Department of Homeland Security, that's not censored content. Okay. Did you hear Mr. Schellenberger's evidence about how our government was using some of its institutions and organizations to censor the speech of Americans on social media? Were you here for that? I saw the hearing, the first part, yes. Okay. Sorry you are giving that that wasn't censorship. I'm not familiar with what exactly you're referencing. Okay, well he had emails going from our government to social media platforms flagging and requesting the removal of social media posts. Does it, do you classify that as censorship? So while I heard that testimony Mr. Schellenberger, I haven't reviewed the specific documents that you are referencing, so I can't speak to the veracity of them. Okay, well let's just go general then. You think that its censorship for the federal government to be reaching out to social media platforms and asking them to remove postings from American citizens. Thank you Congressman. I would reiterate that the Department of Homeland Security has not engaged in content moderation conversations with social media companies. Okay, that's not what I asked you. Okay, do you study history Mr. K? Generally, generally okay. What about you, ma'am? Mr. Harrington? Generally? Generally? Okay, typically what types of government censor their own people? Go ahead, either of you. So it's a little bit more complicated. Yeah, sir. Yeah, agree. Did totalitarian governments do that? Yes, no, it's not hard. Broadly yes. Do communist governments do that? Socialistic governments do that. Why do you think they do that? What do they think that they try and control the speech of their own people? Ma'am, Mr. Harrington? Yes, I think that's correct, probably political control. Yeah, absolutely, Mr. K. Yeah, I would agree. Do you think it's important that we try not to become like them? I believe this government is not like them. I believe we are respectful of our constitutional rights, we ensure that all the work that we are doing is protected by our civil liberties and civil rights offices. And we do that with respect to all of our freedoms, including you. Well, thank you, but I would actually respectfully disagree with that point of view. As a matter of fact, if you were paying attention to some of the evidence produced in the last panel, you would know that as somebody who's involved in law enforcement, that was evidence, sir. That's what any law enforcement officer would consider evidence. Those emails going from our government, to social media platforms, flagging and requesting the removal of posts and speech from American citizens. So you can sit there and you can give me all the little canned answers you want. But when you actually open your mind and are willing to look at the evidence being presented, it's obvious. Now, this shouldn't be a partisan issue. We all know that on this panel. It shouldn't be a Democrat or Republican issue. It should be, are we willing to become like other totalitarian governments, communist to government, socialistic governments that censor the speech of our own people? And I hope you to take this very seriously, because I'm sure that many of the people that have participated in some of these communist totalitarian governments in history felt like they were doing the right thing. And so I hope that you guys take this very seriously. And I hope you take our constitution very seriously and free speech, because I'll tell you this. It is most important to protect free speech, not when you agree with people, but when you disagree with them.",subjective,government censorship

The millions of migrants coming across our border illegally, the human trafficking, the fentanyl, the lost, unaccompanied minors. But today we hear something that is even more important than that. Today we hear the real personal stories of unfathomable loss and irreplaceable lives. Yet, even in the face of this testimony that we have heard today and the testimony that came before it, our colleagues across the aisle impune the purpose and the necessity of this hearing, calling it a political sham, calling it a stunt, calling it theater, and they suggest that what we actually need to do is pass more laws. So as a former federal prosecutor and judge, I'll start today with a refresher on a few of the things that are currently illegal in the United States of America. It is illegal to traffic fentanyl in the United States of America. Human trafficking is illegal in this country. Theft is illegal in this country. Rape and murder are illegal in this country. What's more, the Department of Homeland Security has an absolute obligation to detain and remove those who enter this country illegally. We do not need more laws. We need a president of the United States and a secretary of the Department of Homeland Security who enforce the laws of this country. But what do we have instead an administration that has deliberately subverted the duly enacted laws of the United States of America that have deliberately defied the orders of course in this United States of America who have ordered and directed that they de-sist these unlawful policies. We have an Department of Homeland Security that has defied inquiries from the United States Congress. And as for the 27 appearances of Secretary Alejandro Miorquez in front of this Congress, not one of those times, did he admit that we have lost operational control of our border, that we have ceded control of our border to the Mexican drug cartels, or acknowledged the scope, scale, and crisis that our communities all across America face as a consequence, as a direct consequence of these lawless policies. Every single time an individual is allowed to enter this country unlawfully, Americans are less safe. Ms. Noble's, Mrs. Dunne, as a mother, I see my child and my family in those photos that you shared with us today. And it is truly something that we cannot fathom, the loss that you have each suffered. I thank you for your willingness to come here today and share with us your stories. I would like to hear your perspective, please. On what more, Congress could be doing to support you and to try to prevent this type of unspeakable tragedy from happening in the lives of another family. We'll start with you, Ms. Noble's. I would like to see every illegal immigrant who comes to come here to be properly embedded in background check. I hear a lot about more funding resources and all that. How is that going to help them do their job in the first place? They failed Kayla by not checking her murderers' background and did not make that one phone call. One, one phone call could have saved my baby's life. They didn't. And after he was arrested, they put some child protective services to come and put him in an unsecured children's home with other children. And I know Americans commit crimes on other Americans, but why do we have to take other countries trash? Why do we need them? Ms. Dunn? We talked about a lot today about more resources at the border. And I appreciate that and I respect that. But I don't think that members in this room and other rooms at the Capitol understand that we are actually at war. And we're at war with the cartels. We're losing our children. We're losing a generation of children. We're at war. We need our military at the border. That's what we need. We don't need more border patrol. We need our military at the border. Stopping the drugs. Stopping people from coming in. They can't come in. We're full. We're closed. That's it. No more money. No more. No more sandwiches. It's closed. I'm sorry. Come through the proper challenge channels. I am a first generation American. My parents both migrated here. Guess what? They did it legally.",subjective,border security

Yes, I think that's correct, probably political control. Absolutely, Mr. K. Yeah, I would agree. Do you think it's important that we try not to become like them? I believe this government is not like them. I believe we are respectful of our constitutional rights. We ensure that all the work that we are doing is protected by our civil liberties and civil rights offices. And we do that with respect to all of our freedoms, including... Well, thank you, but I would actually respectfully disagree with that point of view. As a matter of fact, if you were paying attention to some of the evidence produced in the last panel, you would know that as somebody who's involved in law enforcement. That was evidence, sir. That's what any law enforcement officer would consider evidence. Those emails going from our government, to social media platforms, flagging and requesting the removal of posts and speech from American citizens. So you can sit there and you can give me all that little canned answers you want. But when you actually open your mind and are willing to look at the evidence being presented, it's obvious. Now, this shouldn't be a partisan issue. We all know that on this panel. It shouldn't be a Democrat or Republican issue. It should be, are we willing to become like other totalitarian governments, communist to government, socialistic governments that censor the speech of our own people? And I hope you two take this very seriously. Because I'm sure that many of the people that have participated in some of these communist totalitarian governments in history felt like they were doing the right thing. And so I hope that you guys take this very seriously. And I hope you take our constitution very seriously and free speech. Because I'll tell you this, it is most important to protect free speech, not when you agree with people, but when you disagree with them. Thank you. I yield back.",subjective,government censorship

Bennie Thompson (D-MS), the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, on Tuesday criticized House Republicans for bringing articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, accusing them of being more focused on partisan politics than finding solutions.   ‚ÄúExtreme MAGA Republican who are running the House of Representatives are deeply unserious people. They don‚Äôt want progress. They don‚Äôt want solutions. They want a political issue. And most of all, they want to please their disgraced former president,‚Äù Rep. Thompson said.   The House Homeland Security Committee is expected to approve two articles of impeachment against Secretary Mayorkas: ‚Äúwillful and systemic refusal to comply with the law‚Äù and ‚Äúbreach of public trust.‚Äù   The first charge centers on the secretary‚Äôs implementation of two Biden administration policies: ‚Äúcatch and release,‚Äù which allows migrants apprehended at the border to be released into the homeland while they await legal proceedings; and humanitarian parole, a longstanding authority that allows border officials to let migrants into the country for special cases during emergencies or global unrest.   The second charge accuses Secretary Mayorkas of making false statements and failing to comply with congressional investigations into his actions. House Republicans say the secretary lied to Congress by claiming in 2022 that DHS had ‚Äúoperational control‚Äù of the border, and they accuse DHS of failing to fulfil 173 requests embedded in some 51 letters to the department.   Democrats and DHS have pushed back on the allegations and reject that disagreeing with policy decisions is a valid reason to impeach a cabinet official.   ‚ÄúImpeachment of Secretary Mayorkas is designed to distract from the fact that Republican have ceded their power to Donald Trump,‚Äù Rep. Thompson said. ‚ÄúThe MAGA-led impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas is a baseless sham, and the few rational Republicans left in the House know that ‚Äî even if they refuse to admit it.

House Republicans take their march in orders from Donald Trump, who has directed them to reject the bipartisan border bill and urge Republican governors to defy a United States Supreme Court order ensuring the Border Patrol can do its job, including members of this committee also. The impeachment of Secretary of May Orcas is designed to distract the public from the fact that Republicans have seeded their power to Donald Trump. When Republicans took control of the House of Representatives, they had an opportunity to work with the White House and the Senate to move the country forward. Instead, they have been consumed by petty infighting during multiple speaker contests, unenforced crisis over government shutdowns and feudal political exercises like impeachment to satisfy the extreme mega-base.

Do you trust the government to censor American speech? The respectfully Congressman, the Department of Homeland Security does not censor content. Okay. Did you hear Mr. Schellenberger's evidence about how our government was using some of its institutions and organizations to censor the speech of Americans on social media? Are you here for that? I saw the hearing, the first part. Yes. Okay. So are you arguing that that wasn't censorship? I'm not familiar with what exactly you're referencing. Okay. Well, he had emails going from our government to social media platforms flagging and requesting the removal of social media posts. Is it, do you classify that as censorship? So while I heard that testimony, Mr. Schellenberger, I haven't reviewed the specific documents that you are referencing so I can't speak to the veracity of them. Okay. Well, let's just go general then. You think that it's censorship for the federal government to be reaching out to social media platforms and asking them to remove postings from American citizens? Thank you, Congressman. I would reiterate that the Department of Homeland Security does not engage in content moderation conversations with social media companies. Okay. That's not what I asked you. Okay. Do you study history, Mr. K? Generally. Generally. Okay. What about you, ma'am? Mr. Harrington? Generally. Generally. Okay. Typically what types of government censor their own people? Go ahead. Either of you. Thorntated? Yeah. Sir, yeah, agree. Do totalitarian governments do that? Yes, no. It's not hard. Broadly, yes. Do communist governments do that? Socialistic governments do that. Why do you think they do that? What do they think that they try and control the speech of their own people? Ma'am, Mr. Harrington? Yes, I think that's correct. Do you think that they do that? Is that not the political control? Yeah, absolutely. Mr. K? Yeah, I would agree. Do you think it's important that we try not to become like them? I believe this government is not like them. I believe we are respectful of our constitutional right, sweet, ensure that all the work that we are doing is protected by our civil liberties and civil rights offices, and we do that with respect to Explorer freedoms, particularly respectfully disagree with that point of view. As a matter of fact, if you were paying attention to some of the evidence produced in the last panel, you would know that as somebody who's involved in law enforcement. That was evidence, sir. That's what any law enforcement officer would consider evidence. Those emails going from our government to social media platforms, flagging and requesting the removal of posts and speech from American citizens. You can sit there and you can give me all the little canned answers you want. But when you actually open your mind and are willing to look at the evidence being presented, it's obvious. Now this shouldn't be a partisan issue. We all know that on this panel. It shouldn't be a Democrat or Republican issue. It should be, are we willing to become like other totalitarian governments, communist government, socialistic governments that censor the speech of our own people? And I hope you to take this very seriously because I'm sure that many of the people that have participated in some of these communist totalitarian governments in history felt like they were doing the right thing. And so I hope that you guys take this very seriously. And I hope you take our constitution very seriously and free speech because I'll tell you this. It is most important to protect free speech, not when you agree with people, but when you disagree with them. Thank you.",subjective,government censorship

So well there's lots to talk about here man. So firstly I'll say is really this is a US problem rather than a problem with the West. So but because the US is an important problem, it is an important country within the West, therefore I guess it does make it everyone's problem. Secondly, don't lump Antifa in with Black Lives Matter as if they're the same thing. They're simply not. Just a Fox News Talking Point. So the vast majority of people who acted in the name with the Black Lives Matter movement were doing nothing more than peacefully protesting racial injustice within their society. There is nothing negative about that. There just isn't. That's a purely positive thing. It's a beautiful thing. It's one of the things that we're lucky enough to be able to do in our country, in our democracies, is protest to bring attention to an issue we think needs more attention. There's nothing bad about that. The riots were bad, but I think we really should separate the peaceful protests from the non-peaceful protests. Antifa are something different. Antifa are essentially fascists themselves, ironically. Basically they undermine the fabric of democracy by basically saying they'll use violence to stymie the political views of other people simply because they deem those views to be fascist, which is a fascist trait, ironically enough. So yeah, they're a problem. But look, man, don't pretend that this issue only exists on the left side of politics. The issues on the right are every bit as bad as Antifa, the proud boys, the oath keepers, new Nazi organisations, all of those tools who saw them the capital on January the 6th, every bit as bad as Antifa, potentially even worse. It's funny when I engage with Americans on here. It really seems that most of the time they see themselves as Republicans or Democrats first and Americans second. And that attitude actually is a strategic weakness. That is a vulnerability that hostile powers can exploit. We actually saw Russia do that during the Trump presidency. I don't know how effective they were, but they certainly tried. So you know, like just as a general thing, why is this a strategic weakness? Well, whenever a country becomes fixated on its own internal problems, it's able to do less internationally. And if those internal problems become critical, you know, and up in a civil war, absolutely that country becomes weaker. And whatever great power you want to look at through history that had deep internal problems, whenever they go through these internal issues, they simply become a less capable international actor. Not because they're less strong, aggregately, but because they're more focused on internal affairs. So the dysfunction in US politics itself is a geostrategic weakness, I would say, yes.",subjective,political dysfunction

If so, save this video for a required Supreme Court case that you'll need to know in order to get a 5 on your exam. Alright, so this case is called New York Times Company P-United States. Basically what happened is the New York Times tried to publish this set of papers or documents called the Pentagon Papers that outlined some of the United States involvement in Vietnam. Now for some APS context, for those of you who are taking APS or both at the same time, as you know, Vietnam was very, very, very controversial and actually we talked about it in the last case we covered Tinker Viedemoine. It was very controversial because we didn't end up winning or doing as well as, you know, the presidents were saying that we did, which is also why they didn't want the Pentagon Papers to get out even though it was Nixon wasn't part of the administration that was in Vietnam or any of the administrations who were in Vietnam. The Nixon administration basically prevented the New York Times from publishing the Pentagon Papers and used this thing called prior restraint. Prior restraint is when a government official or entity tries to stop the publishing of a particular piece of material or some particular piece in a news article or news outlet. An example of this would be let's say I become the president of the United States and I don't like that the New York, I get word that the New York Times is going to cover how I don't like cheese. I actually do like cheese. But let's say that was the case. Then maybe I would ask the New York Times not to publish that and try to restrain them from doing so, which would be prior restraint because it would be prior to the publication of the material. The Supreme Court has said that this is a big no-no because it's a violation of the first amendment rights of the company or the organization or the entity, the person who's trying to publish that paper. As you all may know, the first amendment really was created so that we had freedom of speech against government entities and prior restraint would be such a large huge threat to that ability to criticize our government. The justices said that security should not be used as a means to override the first amendment because the Nixon administration argued that they wanted to restrain it for security. They were like, what the war is over? Let the people know about this. You have no business trying to prevent it from getting out.

The US government can be broken up into two main parts, the federal and state governments. This is outlined in the Constitution, a document signed and adopted in 1787 after the short coming of the articles of Confederation. The 10th Amendment pretty much states that any task not allocated to the federal government under the Constitution becomes the responsibility of the state, which I will elaborate on in further videos. Now the Constitution outlines the core of the federal government into three branches, the legislative executive in judicial. The legislative branch includes all of Congress and is tasked with introducing and passing laws among other powers like confirming Supreme Court justices. On the contrary, the executive branch has an obligation to help enforce those laws. This branch consists of the President, the Vice President, and his Cabinet, or advisors, and their agencies. Finally, we have the judicial branch, which interprets and then rules on laws. Although consisting of many levels, the highest court in the United States is the Supreme Court, which in terms of laws are constitutional or unconstitutional. Now one of the brilliant things about the US government is the checks and balance system. Basically, a series of ways that each branch can ensure that one branch doesn't become too powerful. A perfect example is the previously mentioned power for Congress to approve Supreme Court justices, nominated by the President.",objective,government structure

So for starters, the US government is divided by three branches. First, you have legislative, executive, and in the judicial. And within the three, they have something that's called checks and balances. So pretty much what that means is that every branch has the power and the ability to check on another branch to make sure no one's abusing their power. So the executive branch consists of the president, their cabinet, and various government agencies. But when most people think of the executive branch, they're only thinking of the president. So the president, they're elected by the Electoral College. They serve a maximum of two terms, each term being four years each. And their job is to carry and enforce laws in the United States. And in here we have our legislative branch, which is made up of Congress, which is actually divided by two chambers, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate is the smaller of the two chambers, which every state getting two senators each, totally enough to 100 senators, and a term for a senator is only six years, but they can be re-elected as many times as they want. And the House of Representatives is the bigger of the two chambers, which are total of 435 members, and each state gets a number of members that's proportional to their state size. So for example, California gets more House of Rep members than Virginia because more people living in California than in Virginia. A House of Rep members serves a term of two years, but like the senators, they can be re-elected as many times as they want. And together as Congress, their job is to write and pass laws in the United States. They have the power to check both the president and the judicial branch. And fun fact, they are the only branch that has the power to declare war in the United States. And then the last branch is the judicial branch. I have a hard time saying that word. And that refers to all of the courts in the United States, but the most powerful and the most important one is the Supreme Court. And here the Supreme Court consists of nine justices or judges, and each one is appointed by the president, but once they're appointed, they serve for life. And their main role is to interpret the laws, and they check the other branches by making sure that the laws that are passed by Congress, or any policies that are proposed by the president are constitutional. And therefore legal in the United States. And this is a simple but simple overview of the US government. Now my question for my students is, is Mexico's government laid out similarly or different from this? Okay, bye!",subjective,government structure

If so, save this video for a required Supreme Court case that you'll need to know in order to get a 5 on your exam. Alright, so this case is called New York Times Company P-United States. Basically what happened is the New York Times tried to publish this set of papers or documents called the Pentagon Papers that outlined some of the United States involvement in Vietnam. Now for some APS context, for those of you who are taking APS or both at the same time, as you know, Vietnam was very, very, very controversial and actually we talked about it in the last case we covered Tinker Viedemoine. It was very controversial because we didn't end up winning or doing as well as, you know, the presidents were saying that we did, which is also why they didn't want the Pentagon Papers to get out even though it was Nixon wasn't part of the administration that was in Vietnam or any of the administrations who were in Vietnam. The Nixon administration basically prevented the New York Times from publishing the Pentagon Papers and used this thing called prior restraint. Prior restraint is when a government official or entity tries to stop the publishing of a particular piece of material or some particular piece in a news article or news outlet. An example of this would be let's say I become the president of the United States and I don't like that the New York, I get word that the New York Times is going to cover how I don't like cheese. I actually do like cheese. But let's say that was the case. Then maybe I would ask the New York Times not to publish that and try to restrain them from doing so, which would be prior restraint because it would be prior to the publication of the material. The Supreme Court has said that this is a big no-no because it's a violation of the first amendment rights of the company or the organization or the entity, the person who's trying to publish that paper. As you all may know, the first amendment really was created so that we had freedom of speech against government entities and prior restraint would be such a large huge threat to that ability to criticize our government. The justices said that security should not be used as a means to override the first amendment because the Nixon administration argued that they wanted to restrain it for security. They were like, what the war is over? Let the people know about this. You have no business trying to prevent it from getting out.

The US government can be broken up into two main parts, the federal and state governments. This is outlined in the Constitution, a document signed and adopted in 1787 after the short coming of the articles of Confederation. The 10th Amendment pretty much states that any task not allocated to the federal government under the Constitution becomes the responsibility of the state, which I will elaborate on in further videos. Now the Constitution outlines the core of the federal government into three branches, the legislative executive in judicial. The legislative branch includes all of Congress and is tasked with introducing and passing laws among other powers like confirming Supreme Court justices. On the contrary, the executive branch has an obligation to help enforce those laws. This branch consists of the President, the Vice President, and his Cabinet, or advisors, and their agencies. Finally, we have the judicial branch, which interprets and then rules on laws. Although consisting of many levels, the highest court in the United States is the Supreme Court, which in terms of laws are constitutional or unconstitutional. Now one of the brilliant things about the US government is the checks and balance system. Basically, a series of ways that each branch can ensure that one branch doesn't become too powerful. A perfect example is the previously mentioned power for Congress to approve Supreme Court justices, nominated by the President.",objective,government structure

So for starters, the US government is divided by three branches. First, you have legislative, executive, and in the judicial. And within the three, they have something that's called checks and balances. So pretty much what that means is that every branch has the power and the ability to check on another branch to make sure no one's abusing their power. So the executive branch consists of the president, their cabinet, and various government agencies. But when most people think of the executive branch, they're only thinking of the president. So the president, they're elected by the Electoral College. They serve a maximum of two terms, each term being four years each. And their job is to carry and enforce laws in the United States. And in here we have our legislative branch, which is made up of Congress, which is actually divided by two chambers, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate is the smaller of the two chambers, which every state getting two senators each, totally enough to 100 senators, and a term for a senator is only six years, but they can be re-elected as many times as they want. And the House of Representatives is the bigger of the two chambers, which are total of 435 members, and each state gets a number of members that's proportional to their state size. So for example, California gets more House of Rep members than Virginia because more people living in California than in Virginia. A House of Rep members serves a term of two years, but like the senators, they can be re-elected as many times as they want. And together as Congress, their job is to write and pass laws in the United States. They have the power to check both the president and the judicial branch. And fun fact, they are the only branch that has the power to declare war in the United States. And then the last branch is the judicial branch. I have a hard time saying that word. And that refers to all of the courts in the United States, but the most powerful and the most important one is the Supreme Court. And here the Supreme Court consists of nine justices or judges, and each one is appointed by the president, but once they're appointed, they serve for life. And their main role is to interpret the laws, and they check the other branches by making sure that the laws that are passed by Congress, or any policies that are proposed by the president are constitutional. And therefore legal in the United States. And this is a simple but simple overview of the US government. Now my question for my students is, is Mexico's government laid out similarly or different from this? Okay, bye!",subjective,government structure

But our system is flawed and has to be fixed. There are lots of things in Washington that would seem to be illegal, but really aren't. If you know your way through the loopholes. When Congress passed the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, it plainly stated a member shall convert no campaign funds to personal use. But soon afterwards, Congressional leaders quietly invented something called leadership packs, political action committees that were not technically campaign funds. And thus exempt from the personal use for the prohibition. This is a loop hold. Right. Certainly every congressman and senator has a leadership pack, not just the leaders. It's like a political slush fund. That's exactly what it is. It's a political slush fund. Over time we've had them. They've been outlawed. They spring back in new guises. This is the latest guise. Senator John Edwards used his leadership pack to pay his mistress, Reel Hunter, $114,000 to make a campaign video. In Republican congressman Andrew Crenshaw of Florida, spent $32,000 hosting a tour of California wineries for a group of contributors from the defense industry, which he has some oversight. The Federal Election Commission is called the level of abuse substantial. When folks are asked for campaign donations and when they make campaign donations, I don't think they have any idea that some of that money is actually going into the members' personal bank account.

We are full of current and former public officials who have been charged with all kinds of crimes and convicted of everything imaginable. Members of Congress and senators and governors, even a serving attorney general like these guys, but also state legislators, big city mayor, statewide elected officials, cabinet officials, White House officials, it happens, it happens all the time. And while that's bad, well, it turns out we've had a lot of crooks in public office, that doesn't feel great. What's good about it is that we know how to deal with it when it happens. It doesn't break our system. It does not break our country to bring serious charges against public officials and former public officials. Even these exact charges that are reportedly on deck against former President Donald Trump in New York, you will recall that this guy, a former senator, a Democratic Party vice presidential nominee, he was brought up on charges almost exactly like what's being reported about allegations against former President Trump. John Edwards was brought up on charges for lying about and concealing a hush money payment that was made to cover up an alleged affair before an election. Those exact charges were brought against a Democratic vice presidential nominee and former senator. And you know what? You forgot about it because the country wasn't exactly rocked to its foundations. Another serving vice president, serving vice president, went up against a 40 count felony indictment for crimes committed while he was in office. With him, they forced him to resign as office as part of a plea deal in federal criminal court. I did a podcast and a book about it and it blew everybody's mind because we've completely forgotten about it because it didn't create a lasting problem for us as a country. It does not bend the Constitution, let alone break it to indict criminals for crimes, even when the alleged criminal is someone who has been elected to a very important job. It is run of the mill public corruption law enforcement in this country and we do it all the time.

It happens all the time. It really does not have to be the end of the world.

If so, save this video for a required Supreme Court case that you'll need to know in order to get a 5 on your exam. Alright, so this case is called New York Times Company P-United States. Basically what happened is the New York Times tried to publish this set of papers or documents called the Pentagon Papers that outlined some of the United States involvement in Vietnam. Now for some APS context, for those of you who are taking APS or both at the same time, as you know, Vietnam was very, very, very controversial and actually we talked about it in the last case we covered Tinker Viedemoine. It was very controversial because we didn't end up winning or doing as well as, you know, the presidents were saying that we did, which is also why they didn't want the Pentagon Papers to get out even though it was Nixon wasn't part of the administration that was in Vietnam or any of the administrations who were in Vietnam. The Nixon administration basically prevented the New York Times from publishing the Pentagon Papers and used this thing called prior restraint. Prior restraint is when a government official or entity tries to stop the publishing of a particular piece of material or some particular piece in a news article or news outlet. An example of this would be let's say I become the president of the United States and I don't like that the New York, I get word that the New York Times is going to cover how I don't like cheese. I actually do like cheese. But let's say that was the case. Then maybe I would ask the New York Times not to publish that and try to restrain them from doing so, which would be prior restraint because it would be prior to the publication of the material. The Supreme Court has said that this is a big no-no because it's a violation of the first amendment rights of the company or the organization or the entity, the person who's trying to publish that paper. As you all may know, the first amendment really was created so that we had freedom of speech against government entities and prior restraint would be such a large huge threat to that ability to criticize our government. The justices said that security should not be used as a means to override the first amendment because the Nixon administration argued that they wanted to restrain it for security. They were like, what the war is over? Let the people know about this. You have no business trying to prevent it from getting out.

The US government can be broken up into two main parts, the federal and state governments. This is outlined in the Constitution, a document signed and adopted in 1787 after the short coming of the articles of Confederation. The 10th Amendment pretty much states that any task not allocated to the federal government under the Constitution becomes the responsibility of the state, which I will elaborate on in further videos. Now the Constitution outlines the core of the federal government into three branches, the legislative executive in judicial. The legislative branch includes all of Congress and is tasked with introducing and passing laws among other powers like confirming Supreme Court justices. On the contrary, the executive branch has an obligation to help enforce those laws. This branch consists of the President, the Vice President, and his Cabinet, or advisors, and their agencies. Finally, we have the judicial branch, which interprets and then rules on laws. Although consisting of many levels, the highest court in the United States is the Supreme Court, which in terms of laws are constitutional or unconstitutional. Now one of the brilliant things about the US government is the checks and balance system. Basically, a series of ways that each branch can ensure that one branch doesn't become too powerful. A perfect example is the previously mentioned power for Congress to approve Supreme Court justices, nominated by the President.",objective,government structure

So for starters, the US government is divided by three branches. First, you have legislative, executive, and in the judicial. And within the three, they have something that's called checks and balances. So pretty much what that means is that every branch has the power and the ability to check on another branch to make sure no one's abusing their power. So the executive branch consists of the president, their cabinet, and various government agencies. But when most people think of the executive branch, they're only thinking of the president. So the president, they're elected by the Electoral College. They serve a maximum of two terms, each term being four years each. And their job is to carry and enforce laws in the United States. And in here we have our legislative branch, which is made up of Congress, which is actually divided by two chambers, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate is the smaller of the two chambers, which every state getting two senators each, totally enough to 100 senators, and a term for a senator is only six years, but they can be re-elected as many times as they want. And the House of Representatives is the bigger of the two chambers, which are total of 435 members, and each state gets a number of members that's proportional to their state size. So for example, California gets more House of Rep members than Virginia because more people living in California than in Virginia. A House of Rep members serves a term of two years, but like the senators, they can be re-elected as many times as they want. And together as Congress, their job is to write and pass laws in the United States. They have the power to check both the president and the judicial branch. And fun fact, they are the only branch that has the power to declare war in the United States. And then the last branch is the judicial branch. I have a hard time saying that word. And that refers to all of the courts in the United States, but the most powerful and the most important one is the Supreme Court. And here the Supreme Court consists of nine justices or judges, and each one is appointed by the president, but once they're appointed, they serve for life. And their main role is to interpret the laws, and they check the other branches by making sure that the laws that are passed by Congress, or any policies that are proposed by the president are constitutional. And therefore legal in the United States. And this is a simple but simple overview of the US government. Now my question for my students is, is Mexico's government laid out similarly or different from this? Okay, bye!",subjective,government structure

The best tickets to all the areas sporting events and junkets to the world's great golf destinations, food and drinks on the house. Access to private jets. In the congressman or senator could take his favorite people from his district. The congressman or senator could take two dozen of his favorite people. Was all that legal? At times we didn't care. Abramoff targeted Vols and offered him a job. You're the chief of staff of a powerful congressman and Jack owns you. And you haven't even left working for the congressman. We were guilty of engaging in a corrupt relationship. So there were several corrupting moments. There isn't just one moment. There were many.

Everything that we want, they're going to do. And not only that, they're going to think of things we can't think of to do. Subverting the essence of our system. Absolutely right. But our system is flawed and has to be fixed. There are lots of things in Washington that would seem to be illegal, but really aren't. If you know your way through the loopholes. When Congress passed the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, it plainly stated a member shall convert no campaign funds to personal use. But soon afterwards, Congressional leaders quietly invented something called leadership packs, political action committees that were not technically campaign funds. And thus exempt from the personal use for the prohibition. This is a loop hold. Right. Certainly every congressman and senator has a leadership pack, not just the leaders. It's like a political slush fund. That's exactly what it is. It's a political slush fund. Over time we've had them. They've been outlawed. They spring back in new guises. This is the latest guise. Senator John Edwards used his leadership pack to pay his mistress, Reel Hunter, $114,000 to make a campaign video. In Republican congressman Andrew Crenshaw of Florida, spent $32,000 hosting a tour of California wineries for a group of contributors from the defense industry, which he has some oversight. The Federal Election Commission is called the level of abuse substantial. When folks are asked for campaign donations and when they make campaign donations, I don't think they have any idea that some of that money is actually going into the members' personal bank account.

How many congressional offices did you actually own? Jack Abramoff may be the most notorious and crooked lobbyist of our time. Today he's a symbol of how money corrupts Washington.

The best tickets to all the areas sporting events and junkets to the world's great golf destinations, food and drinks on the house. Access to private jets. In the congressman or senator could take his favorite people from his district. The congressman or senator could take two dozen of his favorite people. Was all that legal? At times we didn't care. Abramoff targeted Vols and offered him a job. You're the chief of staff of a powerful congressman and Jack owns you. And you haven't even left working for the congressman. We were guilty of engaging in a corrupt relationship. So there were several corrupting moments. There isn't just one moment. There were many.

Everything that we want, they're going to do. And not only that, they're going to think of things we can't think of to do. Subverting the essence of our system. Absolutely right. But our system is flawed and has to be fixed. There are lots of things in Washington that would seem to be illegal, but really aren't. If you know your way through the loopholes. When Congress passed the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, it plainly stated a member shall convert no campaign funds to personal use. But soon afterwards, Congressional leaders quietly invented something called leadership packs, political action committees that were not technically campaign funds. And thus exempt from the personal use for the prohibition. This is a loop hold. Right. Certainly every congressman and senator has a leadership pack, not just the leaders. It's like a political slush fund. That's exactly what it is. It's a political slush fund. Over time we've had them. They've been outlawed. They spring back in new guises. This is the latest guise. Senator John Edwards used his leadership pack to pay his mistress, Reel Hunter, $114,000 to make a campaign video. In Republican congressman Andrew Crenshaw of Florida, spent $32,000 hosting a tour of California wineries for a group of contributors from the defense industry, which he has some oversight. The Federal Election Commission is called the level of abuse substantial. When folks are asked for campaign donations and when they make campaign donations, I don't think they have any idea that some of that money is actually going into the members' personal bank account.

We are full of current and former public officials who have been charged with all kinds of crimes and convicted of everything imaginable. Members of Congress and senators and governors, even a serving attorney general like these guys, but also state legislators, big city mayor, statewide elected officials, cabinet officials, White House officials, it happens, it happens all the time. And while that's bad, well, it turns out we've had a lot of crooks in public office, that doesn't feel great. What's good about it is that we know how to deal with it when it happens. It doesn't break our system. It does not break our country to bring serious charges against public officials and former public officials. Even these exact charges that are reportedly on deck against former President Donald Trump in New York, you will recall that this guy, a former senator, a Democratic Party vice presidential nominee, he was brought up on charges almost exactly like what's being reported about allegations against former President Trump. John Edwards was brought up on charges for lying about and concealing a hush money payment that was made to cover up an alleged affair before an election. Those exact charges were brought against a Democratic vice presidential nominee and former senator. And you know what? You forgot about it because the country wasn't exactly rocked to its foundations. Another serving vice president, serving vice president, went up against a 40 count felony indictment for crimes committed while he was in office. With him, they forced him to resign as office as part of a plea deal in federal criminal court. I did a podcast and a book about it and it blew everybody's mind because we've completely forgotten about it because it didn't create a lasting problem for us as a country. It does not bend the Constitution, let alone break it to indict criminals for crimes, even when the alleged criminal is someone who has been elected to a very important job. It is run of the mill public corruption law enforcement in this country and we do it all the time. And there is no reason why a former president should be magically immune from the same legal system that just in the past three years has put handcuffs on at least 13 state senators, 17 state representatives, one serving congressman, one former congressman, the Delaware state auditor, the North Carolina Republican Party chair, the insurance commissioner of Georgia and too many city councilors Alderman County executives and mayors to count. It happens all the time. It really does not have to be the end of the world. And anybody telling you that if there is an indictment of this particular former public official, there will be a protest like you've never seen before. There will be civil war. There will be an unstoppable uprising among his supporters and violence and all the rest. Anybody telling you that that is the consequence of him being potentially indicted? Well, that person may be wishing for that. But there's no reason that something like that is inevitable. This is not something coming up that is extraneous to our system that we need to invent something new to contend with. The bottom line here is that prosecuting public officials and former public officials, it happens all the time in the United States of America. And it never engenders violence. And it never endangers the country. And it doesn't require our legal system to be fundamentally rethought or dismantled. Unless someone wants to try to gin that up.

We just talked about the first climate case to get a trial in the United States. Now we're talking about the first climate case to get a trial on a federal level, which is huge, and I don't understand why people aren't talking about this again. Before getting into the bumpy timeline of Juliana versus the US government, it's worth being noted that this is not just an active case, but this is a case that's being actively attacked by the US DOJ. We haven't been talking about it, so let's talk about it now. The Juliana versus US government court case. This case was filed all the way back in 2015 when it was filed and the US District Court in Oregon. The case claims that the United States government is violating the youth's right to life, liberty, and property, as well as failing to protect essential public trust resources. I didn't mention this in my previous videos, but these cases come with what's called a statement of facts, and they explicitly call out exactly how the government puts its people and its resources in danger through false-of-field pollution. Hereafter, this case was filed in Oregon. The false-of-field industry joined the US government as a defendant on the case, essentially trying to dismiss the case alongside the government. A district court judge denied this request, and a few months later, a judge ordered that the false-of-field industry be taken off as defendants on the case. A trial date was then set for February of 2018. Not even a month after the trial date was set, the Trump administration requested for the case to be dismissed through a method called the Ritz of Mandamus. This is essentially a request that a higher court, bells a lower court to cut it out. This is typically a very extreme request, and it required that the court of appeals suspend the case temporarily to review this request. After hearing responses from the youth group and from the district court that was managing this case, and from expert organizations around the world that submitted briefs in support of the youth plaintiffs, they decided to deny the US government of this request. The following month, a new date was set for October of 2018 for the trial to start. The government then requests for a protective order, which prevents the disclosure of sensitive information except to certain individuals under certain circumstances. I wonder why. After this request was denied, the US government filed another Ritz of Mandamus petition. The US Supreme Court unanimously decides to reject this request, as well as rejecting the request from the government to see all the evidence and facts that the youth group was going to present before the district court heard it. The US government filed another motion to halt discovery and filed another Ritz of Mandamus. Now that this is the third Ritz of Mandamus, the Supreme Court halts the case temporarily to review it. A few weeks later, it was when the trial was supposed to go on, but it was suspended. So instead, thousands of Americans came out in support from all across the country to stand at the courthouse in support of the youth group. So the timeline between 2018 and October to June 2023 of this year is a whole bunch of legal pinplung, which I don't really think is relevant to the state of the case today. So I'll just say that I commend the youth group and their attorneys and the organization supporting them because that's a headache and a half. So I'll ask forward to this year, June of 2023, when a judge grants the youth group's request to have the trial go forward. Knowing that this trial was in danger of petition of over 250 organizations and more than 50,000 individuals signed and sent to the DOJ to let this case go forward. And only 11 days ago did the DOJ request for this case to be dismissed. So now we're waiting to hear what the response to the DOJ's request is, as well as when the trial date would actually start. We should get more answers within the next few weeks, but right now the youth group is asking for anyone who can or anyone who cares to tweet, email or if you're feeling chatty, call the DOJ and ask that the attorney general let the case go through. I'll be keeping close watch on this and we'll let you know as soon as we hear more.",subjective,climate lawsuit

It's actually easier to track the number of states that haven't introduced anti-LGBTQ bills from those that have. There's only four. Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, and Delaware. I'm Katie Balevik and I cover LGBTQ issues for Insider. The overall trend shows how right-wing lawmakers and mass are targeting the queer community. Texas leads the way targeting freedom of speech, access to health care, what kids can talk about in schools. Missouri follows with 48 bills. Then Oklahoma with 35. Iowa has 29, Tennessee has 26, and the list goes on. Some states are copying each other's anti-LGBTQ bills, creating a national framework of laws, making it increasingly difficult for the LGBTQ community to just exist and live. Attend school, work, participate in extracurriculars. There are dozens of bills across different states targeting specifically the trans community and drag queens, people who dress up in drag. For example, a drag queen story hour, which are essentially a pretty toned down way for young kids to interact with the LGBTQ community. Down came the rain and washed the spider out. It's not a provocative experience. It's just kind of helping them gain some familiarity and see, okay, these are people. This person might look different from who you would see on the street every day, but this is a person. There have been efforts in a variety of states to target the ability for young people to get access to gender affirming health care. In Georgia, a state that has leaned purple and blue in recent elections, they actually managed to pass an anti-LGBTQ bill that was preventing young people from accessing gender affirming health care, which includes surgeries as well, as just hormone therapy. So it's very much a selective targeting of who can use what kind of medical interventions and for what reasons. Together we will keep Texas the greatest state. Texas, Governor Greg Abbott has encouraged his citizens to report parents who have trans children and let those children live as they are. They want citizens to report those parents for child abuse, which is a very serious charge and has caused some families to flee the state with their kids because they want to have a safe place for them to grow up and not feel targeted. A lot of it falls under the guise of protecting children, so they will say that they're protecting children from permanently mutilating their bodies. They'll say they're protecting children from material that they find to be pornographic, and they've used that as a reason to ban books, talking about sex and gender, ban conversations about it in public. They want to pull books off of bookshelves. There is a distinction between lawmakers who are really passionate about their anti-LGBTQ beliefs. A lot of them are based in religion. There are others, I would say, that are just kind of going with the flow and following the votes. The Trump era definitely kind of kick started the anti-trans targeting. Trump announced in a series of tweets that transgender people would no longer be welcome to serve in the military. Now, a few years later, there's so much more of a national movement and you have lots of different Republican governors pushing these laws. Governor DeSantis really, I think, led the charge with Don't Say Gay, with that legislation, and it picked up, and once they see that kind of success in one state, they're going to do it in another state. And that applies for a variety of different types of laws, whether it's about LGBTQ rights or abortion rights or talking about American history and race in schools. When they see something be a real flashpoint for conservatives in one state, a lot of times it'll spread like wildfire. There are definitely groups that are also lobbying to try and push this type of legislation forward. There are about 60 anti-LGBTQ groups that are identified as hate groups by the Southern Property Law Center. And that goes beyond just whether or not they think that members of the LGBTQ community should have basic rights. It's specifically promoting disinformation, pseudo-science, really damaging tropes about the LGBTQ community. A lot of these groups are tied to religion. Many of them have Baptist groups in the name. These bills and this overall movement has had a devastating impact on the mental health in the LGBTQ community. Some 40% of LGBTQ youth have reported seriously considering suicide. Those numbers increased drastically for people who are trans and non-binary. Some of the people who have said that they have considered suicide seriously or attempted suicide cited anti-LGBTQ sentiment and laws and bills as a reason for it. The rest of the year for the LGBTQ community is going to likely look like members of a protected class living in fear. The Department of Homeland Security has actually said that the LGBTQ community is at risk of being targeted by domestic terrorists. We had five people killed at the club Q shooting in Colorado last year. So there is a very real threat of extreme violence against members of the LGBTQ community. On top of the day-to-day threats of if you're a parent of a trans child are you going to be reported for abuse or if you're a drag queen performing a story hour our police going to show up, our protesters and proud boys going to show up. And then when you look forward to the elections it's likely that this type of rhetoric will continue.",subjective,lgbt

This is a document entitled Prison Conditions and Prisoner Abuse after Katrina, and the document date is December 14, 2005. Katrina hit August 29, 2005. The Orleans Parish Prison fell into chaos five days after Hurricane Katrina stuck New Orleans on August 29. As the water rose in the prison buildings, deputies deserted on mass, leaving behind prisoners and locked cells. These prisoners spent days without power, food or water, some standing in sewage-tainted water up to their chests are next. Mind you, some of these people were not yet convicted. Like they were still waiting to go to trial, by the way, to put some more things into context for you, right? The ACLU said that more than 1,000 testimonials it has obtained from prisoners contradict public statements made by Sheriff Marlin and Gusman that the prisoners had food and water and that the evacuation went as planned. Some prisoners claim that deputies forced them into their selves by shooting beanbags, macing, and tasering them. Once they were returned to their selves, some deputies handcuffed the cell doors to prevent them from opening and escaping. As the locked cells begin to flood, prisoners hung signs out of broken windows for help, and others jumped into the water below. According to the testimonials, deputies and members of the Special Investigation Division shot at some of the prisoners who were attempting to escape the rising water inside the jail. Several prisoners report that they witnessed fellow prisoners getting shot in the back. When the prisoners were finally evacuated from the jail, many were forced to wade through toxic waste-filled water over to the Broad Street Interpass on Interstate 10. To go over the interstate, because I'd like to show you a picture of how you couldn't fucking get out of Louisiana during Katrina. This is the interstate. In and out. In and out. Let's go back here. While the prisoners were evacuated from jail, prisoners reported that the armed guards at the Overpass had K-9 dogs, which were used to threaten them and that they were maced and beaten. Female prisoners also report that deputies directed degrading and sexually offensive comments at them. In August 2006, one year after Katrina, the ACLU's National Prison Project released abandoned and abused Orleans Parish Prisoners in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The report documents the experience of thousands of men, women, and children in the Orleans Parish Prison in the days after this storm. In response to reports that hundreds of prisoners have returned to the Orleans Parish Prison, and this again 2005, or excuse me 2006, in response to hundreds of prisoners have returned to Orleans Parish Prison, the ACLU urged the City Council to conduct a full and thorough review of the conditions within the facility. In letters to each council member, the ACLU expressed concern that Sheriff Gusman reopened the prison despite the lack of adequate evacuation plans or medical staff and equipment. These are a couple of quotes from inmates who are not named, they're a number. These are just a few of them. The water was nasty and all black and dirty and all type of debris, even human waste. The deputy we thought would help burst in spring mace. People were dead from starving, from not eating or drinking. The water was so deep I had small prisoners holding on to me. We were called bitches and whores and we weren't moved until Monday night after the storm passed. I saw an old man being attacked by police canines simply because he got up to stretch. I waited through water that was filled with sewage up to my neck. I even saw one man who was hog tied, maced and bitten by a canine and they said, be glad that you're not dead.

Carcerated workers, by the way, typically earn little to no pay at all with many making just pennies an hour. How much does it cost to house an inmate? In 2020, state government spend a combined 55 billion on correction. You can see down here, Mississippi only spends around 18,000 and Wyoming spends about 135,000. Point is, if you take that 55 billion and cross-reference it to the 11 billion that inmates produce, yeah, you'll think it's very expensive to house an inmate. You'll see that there's a deficit in the amount of capital that inmates are producing and the amount that it costs to house them. However, this is where critical thinking and some connecting of the dots comes in. For instance, the prison phone industry, a market that's dominated by several large privately held firms that earn an estimated 1.2 billion per year. The private companies also offer state and local authorities a percentage of their revenue. Some jails have removed in-person family visitation rooms to make way for video visitation terminal, provided by private firms which can charge as much as $30 for 40 minutes of screen time. On prison phone companies, Securus Technologies says in its marketing materials that it has paid out 1.3 billion in these so-called commissions over the past 10 years. Horizon Health, one of the sponsors of the Louisiana Prison Trade Show, is the country's largest prison health care firm. It treats more than 300,000 prisoners nationwide earning about 1.4 billion in annual revenue. There's also the subject of numerous investigations in lawsuit. Many prisons and jails basic commissary items like cereal and canned soup can cost five times the retail price, as the country's inmate population has ballooned, so has revenue. Prison policy initiative estimates that the commissary companies earn 1.6 billion per year. There are just a few companies that are each earning billions of dollars a year off of the prison system. Again, if you look at this 11 billion number and cross-reference it with the 55 billion that it costs to house inmate, it looks like there's a deficit. But then when you consider all of the other companies and organizations that are involved and have hands in making money in the prison industry, begin to connect the dots and start to realize that it's very lucrative for a lot of different industries for people to be in prison. For example, Apple. A iPhone, Apple does not manufacture the screens, Apple does not make the batteries, does it make the camera sensors, Apple didn't even manufacture the processor. Long line of a bunch of different companies came together to make the iPhone and it is sold as an Apple device. Even though in the US there are public and private prisons, all prisons are basically private prisons. As even public prisons outsource a lot of the operations to third parties that are private businesses. Just looking at the revenue that is made by this state does not give you a full picture of the situation, it doesn't give you a full picture of all of the different industries that are involved in making the prison industry work. Is way more than just billions of dollars at play here? Take into account all the food vendors, all the cell phone communication companies. The fact that a lot of maintenance that's done to prisons, that a lot of people cite as being very expensive is done by prisoners and is done for no pay. We may never truly know the actual dollar amount of all of the free labor that prisoners are providing for America. For very obvious reasons. Just like how we may never know the true exact dollar amount of all of the free labor that was provided by Africans during slavery in America. Now it's a fuck ton of money. We also have a lot of reasons to believe that it's even a fuck ton more than the fuck ton we already know that it is. Point here is there is nothing but incentives for the government and corporations to work together, collude if you will, to lobby and change laws to make it so that more people end up in prison. To actually know the facts, it becomes quite obvious and clear, only that stuff like this will become common knowledge.

It's actually easier to track the number of states that haven't introduced anti-LGBTQ bills from those that have. There's only four. Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, and Delaware. I'm Katie Balevik and I cover LGBTQ issues for Insider. The overall trend shows how right-wing lawmakers and mass are targeting the queer community. Texas leads the way targeting freedom of speech, access to health care, what kids can talk about in schools. Missouri follows with 48 bills. Then Oklahoma with 35. Iowa has 29, Tennessee has 26, and the list goes on. Some states are copying each other's anti-LGBTQ bills, creating a national framework of laws, making it increasingly difficult for the LGBTQ community to just exist and live. Attend school, work, participate in extracurriculars. There are dozens of bills across different states targeting specifically the trans community and drag queens, people who dress up in drag. For example, a drag queen story hour, which are essentially a pretty toned down way for young kids to interact with the LGBTQ community. Down came the rain and washed the spider out. It's not a provocative experience. It's just kind of helping them gain some familiarity and see, okay, these are people. This person might look different from who you would see on the street every day, but this is a person. There have been efforts in a variety of states to target the ability for young people to get access to gender affirming health care. In Georgia, a state that has leaned purple and blue in recent elections, they actually managed to pass an anti-LGBTQ bill that was preventing young people from accessing gender affirming health care, which includes surgeries as well, as just hormone therapy. So it's very much a selective targeting of who can use what kind of medical interventions and for what reasons. Together we will keep Texas the greatest state. Texas, Governor Greg Abbott has encouraged his citizens to report parents who have trans children and let those children live as they are. They want citizens to report those parents for child abuse, which is a very serious charge and has caused some families to flee the state with their kids because they want to have a safe place for them to grow up and not feel targeted. A lot of it falls under the guise of protecting children, so they will say that they're protecting children from permanently mutilating their bodies. They'll say they're protecting children from material that they find to be pornographic, and they've used that as a reason to ban books, talking about sex and gender, ban conversations about it in public. They want to pull books off of bookshelves. There is a distinction between lawmakers who are really passionate about their anti-LGBTQ beliefs. A lot of them are based in religion. There are others, I would say, that are just kind of going with the flow and following the votes. The Trump era definitely kind of kick started the anti-trans targeting. Trump announced in a series of tweets that transgender people would no longer be welcome to serve in the military. Now, a few years later, there's so much more of a national movement and you have lots of different Republican governors pushing these laws. Governor DeSantis really, I think, led the charge with Don't Say Gay, with that legislation, and it picked up, and once they see that kind of success in one state, they're going to do it in another state. And that applies for a variety of different types of laws, whether it's about LGBTQ rights or abortion rights or talking about American history and race in schools. When they see something be a real flashpoint for conservatives in one state, a lot of times it'll spread like wildfire. There are definitely groups that are also lobbying to try and push this type of legislation forward. There are about 60 anti-LGBTQ groups that are identified as hate groups by the Southern Property Law Center. And that goes beyond just whether or not they think that members of the LGBTQ community should have basic rights. It's specifically promoting disinformation, pseudo-science, really damaging tropes about the LGBTQ community. A lot of these groups are tied to religion. Many of them have Baptist groups in the name. These bills and this overall movement has had a devastating impact on the mental health in the LGBTQ community. Some 40% of LGBTQ youth have reported seriously considering suicide. Those numbers increased drastically for people who are trans and non-binary. Some of the people who have said that they have considered suicide seriously or attempted suicide cited anti-LGBTQ sentiment and laws and bills as a reason for it. The rest of the year for the LGBTQ community is going to likely look like members of a protected class living in fear. The Department of Homeland Security has actually said that the LGBTQ community is at risk of being targeted by domestic terrorists. We had five people killed at the club Q shooting in Colorado last year. So there is a very real threat of extreme violence against members of the LGBTQ community. On top of the day-to-day threats of if you're a parent of a trans child are you going to be reported for abuse or if you're a drag queen performing a story hour our police going to show up, our protesters and proud boys going to show up. And then when you look forward to the elections it's likely that this type of rhetoric will continue.",subjective,lgbt

This is a document entitled Prison Conditions and Prisoner Abuse after Katrina, and the document date is December 14, 2005. Katrina hit August 29, 2005. The Orleans Parish Prison fell into chaos five days after Hurricane Katrina stuck New Orleans on August 29. As the water rose in the prison buildings, deputies deserted on mass, leaving behind prisoners and locked cells. These prisoners spent days without power, food or water, some standing in sewage-tainted water up to their chests are next. Mind you, some of these people were not yet convicted. Like they were still waiting to go to trial, by the way, to put some more things into context for you, right? The ACLU said that more than 1,000 testimonials it has obtained from prisoners contradict public statements made by Sheriff Marlin and Gusman that the prisoners had food and water and that the evacuation went as planned. Some prisoners claim that deputies forced them into their selves by shooting beanbags, macing, and tasering them. Once they were returned to their selves, some deputies handcuffed the cell doors to prevent them from opening and escaping. As the locked cells begin to flood, prisoners hung signs out of broken windows for help, and others jumped into the water below. According to the testimonials, deputies and members of the Special Investigation Division shot at some of the prisoners who were attempting to escape the rising water inside the jail. Several prisoners report that they witnessed fellow prisoners getting shot in the back. When the prisoners were finally evacuated from the jail, many were forced to wade through toxic waste-filled water over to the Broad Street Interpass on Interstate 10. To go over the interstate, because I'd like to show you a picture of how you couldn't fucking get out of Louisiana during Katrina. This is the interstate. In and out. In and out. Let's go back here. While the prisoners were evacuated from jail, prisoners reported that the armed guards at the Overpass had K-9 dogs, which were used to threaten them and that they were maced and beaten. Female prisoners also report that deputies directed degrading and sexually offensive comments at them. In August 2006, one year after Katrina, the ACLU's National Prison Project released abandoned and abused Orleans Parish Prisoners in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The report documents the experience of thousands of men, women, and children in the Orleans Parish Prison in the days after this storm. In response to reports that hundreds of prisoners have returned to the Orleans Parish Prison, and this again 2005, or excuse me 2006, in response to hundreds of prisoners have returned to Orleans Parish Prison, the ACLU urged the City Council to conduct a full and thorough review of the conditions within the facility. In letters to each council member, the ACLU expressed concern that Sheriff Gusman reopened the prison despite the lack of adequate evacuation plans or medical staff and equipment. These are a couple of quotes from inmates who are not named, they're a number. These are just a few of them. The water was nasty and all black and dirty and all type of debris, even human waste. The deputy we thought would help burst in spring mace. People were dead from starving, from not eating or drinking. The water was so deep I had small prisoners holding on to me. We were called bitches and whores and we weren't moved until Monday night after the storm passed. I saw an old man being attacked by police canines simply because he got up to stretch. I waited through water that was filled with sewage up to my neck. I even saw one man who was hog tied, maced and bitten by a canine and they said, be glad that you're not dead.

Carcerated workers, by the way, typically earn little to no pay at all with many making just pennies an hour. How much does it cost to house an inmate? In 2020, state government spend a combined 55 billion on correction. You can see down here, Mississippi only spends around 18,000 and Wyoming spends about 135,000. Point is, if you take that 55 billion and cross-reference it to the 11 billion that inmates produce, yeah, you'll think it's very expensive to house an inmate. You'll see that there's a deficit in the amount of capital that inmates are producing and the amount that it costs to house them. However, this is where critical thinking and some connecting of the dots comes in. For instance, the prison phone industry, a market that's dominated by several large privately held firms that earn an estimated 1.2 billion per year. The private companies also offer state and local authorities a percentage of their revenue. Some jails have removed in-person family visitation rooms to make way for video visitation terminal, provided by private firms which can charge as much as $30 for 40 minutes of screen time. On prison phone companies, Securus Technologies says in its marketing materials that it has paid out 1.3 billion in these so-called commissions over the past 10 years. Horizon Health, one of the sponsors of the Louisiana Prison Trade Show, is the country's largest prison health care firm. It treats more than 300,000 prisoners nationwide earning about 1.4 billion in annual revenue. There's also the subject of numerous investigations in lawsuit. Many prisons and jails basic commissary items like cereal and canned soup can cost five times the retail price, as the country's inmate population has ballooned, so has revenue. Prison policy initiative estimates that the commissary companies earn 1.6 billion per year. There are just a few companies that are each earning billions of dollars a year off of the prison system. Again, if you look at this 11 billion number and cross-reference it with the 55 billion that it costs to house inmate, it looks like there's a deficit. But then when you consider all of the other companies and organizations that are involved and have hands in making money in the prison industry, begin to connect the dots and start to realize that it's very lucrative for a lot of different industries for people to be in prison. For example, Apple. A iPhone, Apple does not manufacture the screens, Apple does not make the batteries, does it make the camera sensors, Apple didn't even manufacture the processor. Long line of a bunch of different companies came together to make the iPhone and it is sold as an Apple device. Even though in the US there are public and private prisons, all prisons are basically private prisons. As even public prisons outsource a lot of the operations to third parties that are private businesses. Just looking at the revenue that is made by this state does not give you a full picture of the situation, it doesn't give you a full picture of all of the different industries that are involved in making the prison industry work. Is way more than just billions of dollars at play here? Take into account all the food vendors, all the cell phone communication companies. The fact that a lot of maintenance that's done to prisons, that a lot of people cite as being very expensive is done by prisoners and is done for no pay. We may never truly know the actual dollar amount of all of the free labor that prisoners are providing for America. For very obvious reasons. Just like how we may never know the true exact dollar amount of all of the free labor that was provided by Africans during slavery in America. Now it's a fuck ton of money. We also have a lot of reasons to believe that it's even a fuck ton more than the fuck ton we already know that it is. Point here is there is nothing but incentives for the government and corporations to work together, collude if you will, to lobby and change laws to make it so that more people end up in prison. To actually know the facts, it becomes quite obvious and clear, only that stuff like this will become common knowledge.

In this decision, the Court concluded that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act does not include a so-called private right of action, a right that has been implied by the courts for many years. This means that only the federal government and not private groups or private parties can bring suit for a violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. You heard that right. Under today's decision, when minorities are disenfranchised through practices by the state or the federal government that discriminate against them on the basis of color, race, or language minority, only the federal government and specifically the attorney general's office can sue and not private individuals. This is a problem because it jeopardizes the ability of countless minorities across the United States to see their vote counted, because currently the vast majority of cases regarding the Voting Rights Act are brought to court through private groups. Additionally, this decision puts 100% of the power to bring lawsuit in the hands of the attorney general, and we know that the attorney general's office has discretion on whether to bring any suit to light or not. This decision is not only obviously very dangerous, but also very startling because it's a clear departure from established jurisprudence from the way courts traditionally decided in these matters. And here is the other problem, because the circuit is split between this decision and decisions in other circuits that have recognized a private right of action, this ruling will certainly be headed for the U.S. Supreme Court. And if you think a decision in this case is clear, think again, because in 2021, a Supreme Court ruling included a concurrent opinion by Justice Gorsuch that said that with that decision, the court wasn't at that time making any implied guarantees that a right of private action actually existed. That means that at least the portion of the bench is open to hearing arguments to decide whether the right of private action in those instances actually exists or should be called non-existent. In the mean time, this decision will stand in a 8th circuit, a decision that was authored by a Trump appointee with the concurrent opinion of a Bush appointee.

One, set an example of what it looks like for somebody to reclaim power back over their personal situation. And two, bring awareness to mental health. Here we go, are you ready? Several years ago, I lost my shit and maced my kid. Go ahead and have your visceral reaction to that. Do whatever you need to do. On follow me, let's do it again. I said several years ago, I lost my shit and I maced my kid. Now that one was actually just purely for the haters because I know you guys love to get off on this sick shit, so you're welcome. Last one, several years ago, I lost my shits and maced my kid. Now let's examine several aspects of that shall we? Do I recommend pepper spraying a human child? No, absolutely not. But I also don't recommend losing your shit in a country where family court is garbage and actively failing women who are being abused every day and sustaining large amount of complex post-traumatic stress disorder, but nobody can treat it because for some day in reason, we value money over human lives and no one has any health care. I think that when people like this see how self-aware I am about the situation, it's very jarring for them because it brings about a lot of shaming guilt that they are probably dealing with in their own lives. Shame is a tool that is used by the powers that be to control and manipulate people into complicity without this the foundation of the American prison system would crumble. There aren't exceptions for people who are going through a mental crisis situation for people who have a disability or for people who simply made a bad choice. But what if we were to approach a rehabilitative system like European countries do that instead of canceling these people and marking them with a scarlet red F? We try to understand them and reinitiate them back into society. Is that such a wild concept? Also, I don't know who needs to hear this today that has some sort of shameful thing in their past, but you don't need to ask anyone's permission to move on with your life. If you have done the work and taken the steps necessary to reconcile what you can and ask forgiveness, whether that forgiveness is granted or not, you have permission to forgive yourself. People love and accept you more when you love and accept yourself with all your flaws and to suggest that anybody should be doing anything else isn't pro-human, it's pro-censorship. People who have had things happen in their life, people who have been to jail, felons, we are capable of love, joy, healing and community. I'm sorry if no one's told you that before.

It's actually easier to track the number of states that haven't introduced anti-LGBTQ bills from those that have. There's only four. Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, and Delaware. I'm Katie Balevik and I cover LGBTQ issues for Insider. The overall trend shows how right-wing lawmakers and mass are targeting the queer community. Texas leads the way targeting freedom of speech, access to health care, what kids can talk about in schools. Missouri follows with 48 bills. Then Oklahoma with 35. Iowa has 29, Tennessee has 26, and the list goes on. Some states are copying each other's anti-LGBTQ bills, creating a national framework of laws, making it increasingly difficult for the LGBTQ community to just exist and live. Attend school, work, participate in extracurriculars. There are dozens of bills across different states targeting specifically the trans community and drag queens, people who dress up in drag. For example, a drag queen story hour, which are essentially a pretty toned down way for young kids to interact with the LGBTQ community. Down came the rain and washed the spider out. It's not a provocative experience. It's just kind of helping them gain some familiarity and see, okay, these are people. This person might look different from who you would see on the street every day, but this is a person. There have been efforts in a variety of states to target the ability for young people to get access to gender affirming health care. In Georgia, a state that has leaned purple and blue in recent elections, they actually managed to pass an anti-LGBTQ bill that was preventing young people from accessing gender affirming health care, which includes surgeries as well, as just hormone therapy. So it's very much a selective targeting of who can use what kind of medical interventions and for what reasons. Together we will keep Texas the greatest state. Texas, Governor Greg Abbott has encouraged his citizens to report parents who have trans children and let those children live as they are. They want citizens to report those parents for child abuse, which is a very serious charge and has caused some families to flee the state with their kids because they want to have a safe place for them to grow up and not feel targeted. A lot of it falls under the guise of protecting children, so they will say that they're protecting children from permanently mutilating their bodies. They'll say they're protecting children from material that they find to be pornographic, and they've used that as a reason to ban books, talking about sex and gender, ban conversations about it in public. They want to pull books off of bookshelves. There is a distinction between lawmakers who are really passionate about their anti-LGBTQ beliefs. A lot of them are based in religion. There are others, I would say, that are just kind of going with the flow and following the votes. The Trump era definitely kind of kick started the anti-trans targeting. Trump announced in a series of tweets that transgender people would no longer be welcome to serve in the military. Now, a few years later, there's so much more of a national movement and you have lots of different Republican governors pushing these laws. Governor DeSantis really, I think, led the charge with Don't Say Gay, with that legislation, and it picked up, and once they see that kind of success in one state, they're going to do it in another state. And that applies for a variety of different types of laws, whether it's about LGBTQ rights or abortion rights or talking about American history and race in schools. When they see something be a real flashpoint for conservatives in one state, a lot of times it'll spread like wildfire. There are definitely groups that are also lobbying to try and push this type of legislation forward. There are about 60 anti-LGBTQ groups that are identified as hate groups by the Southern Property Law Center. And that goes beyond just whether or not they think that members of the LGBTQ community should have basic rights. It's specifically promoting disinformation, pseudo-science, really damaging tropes about the LGBTQ community. A lot of these groups are tied to religion. Many of them have Baptist groups in the name. These bills and this overall movement has had a devastating impact on the mental health in the LGBTQ community. Some 40% of LGBTQ youth have reported seriously considering suicide. Those numbers increased drastically for people who are trans and non-binary. Some of the people who have said that they have considered suicide seriously or attempted suicide cited anti-LGBTQ sentiment and laws and bills as a reason for it. The rest of the year for the LGBTQ community is going to likely look like members of a protected class living in fear. The Department of Homeland Security has actually said that the LGBTQ community is at risk of being targeted by domestic terrorists. We had five people killed at the club Q shooting in Colorado last year. So there is a very real threat of extreme violence against members of the LGBTQ community. On top of the day-to-day threats of if you're a parent of a trans child are you going to be reported for abuse or if you're a drag queen performing a story hour our police going to show up, our protesters and proud boys going to show up. And then when you look forward to the elections it's likely that this type of rhetoric will continue.",subjective,lgbt

This is a document entitled Prison Conditions and Prisoner Abuse after Katrina, and the document date is December 14, 2005. Katrina hit August 29, 2005. The Orleans Parish Prison fell into chaos five days after Hurricane Katrina stuck New Orleans on August 29. As the water rose in the prison buildings, deputies deserted on mass, leaving behind prisoners and locked cells. These prisoners spent days without power, food or water, some standing in sewage-tainted water up to their chests are next. Mind you, some of these people were not yet convicted. Like they were still waiting to go to trial, by the way, to put some more things into context for you, right? The ACLU said that more than 1,000 testimonials it has obtained from prisoners contradict public statements made by Sheriff Marlin and Gusman that the prisoners had food and water and that the evacuation went as planned. Some prisoners claim that deputies forced them into their selves by shooting beanbags, macing, and tasering them. Once they were returned to their selves, some deputies handcuffed the cell doors to prevent them from opening and escaping. As the locked cells begin to flood, prisoners hung signs out of broken windows for help, and others jumped into the water below. According to the testimonials, deputies and members of the Special Investigation Division shot at some of the prisoners who were attempting to escape the rising water inside the jail. Several prisoners report that they witnessed fellow prisoners getting shot in the back. When the prisoners were finally evacuated from the jail, many were forced to wade through toxic waste-filled water over to the Broad Street Interpass on Interstate 10. To go over the interstate, because I'd like to show you a picture of how you couldn't fucking get out of Louisiana during Katrina. This is the interstate. In and out. In and out. Let's go back here. While the prisoners were evacuated from jail, prisoners reported that the armed guards at the Overpass had K-9 dogs, which were used to threaten them and that they were maced and beaten. Female prisoners also report that deputies directed degrading and sexually offensive comments at them. In August 2006, one year after Katrina, the ACLU's National Prison Project released abandoned and abused Orleans Parish Prisoners in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The report documents the experience of thousands of men, women, and children in the Orleans Parish Prison in the days after this storm. In response to reports that hundreds of prisoners have returned to the Orleans Parish Prison, and this again 2005, or excuse me 2006, in response to hundreds of prisoners have returned to Orleans Parish Prison, the ACLU urged the City Council to conduct a full and thorough review of the conditions within the facility. In letters to each council member, the ACLU expressed concern that Sheriff Gusman reopened the prison despite the lack of adequate evacuation plans or medical staff and equipment. These are a couple of quotes from inmates who are not named, they're a number. These are just a few of them. The water was nasty and all black and dirty and all type of debris, even human waste. The deputy we thought would help burst in spring mace. People were dead from starving, from not eating or drinking. The water was so deep I had small prisoners holding on to me. We were called bitches and whores and we weren't moved until Monday night after the storm passed. I saw an old man being attacked by police canines simply because he got up to stretch. I waited through water that was filled with sewage up to my neck. I even saw one man who was hog tied, maced and bitten by a canine and they said, be glad that you're not dead.

Carcerated workers, by the way, typically earn little to no pay at all with many making just pennies an hour. How much does it cost to house an inmate? In 2020, state government spend a combined 55 billion on correction. You can see down here, Mississippi only spends around 18,000 and Wyoming spends about 135,000. Point is, if you take that 55 billion and cross-reference it to the 11 billion that inmates produce, yeah, you'll think it's very expensive to house an inmate. You'll see that there's a deficit in the amount of capital that inmates are producing and the amount that it costs to house them. However, this is where critical thinking and some connecting of the dots comes in. For instance, the prison phone industry, a market that's dominated by several large privately held firms that earn an estimated 1.2 billion per year. The private companies also offer state and local authorities a percentage of their revenue. Some jails have removed in-person family visitation rooms to make way for video visitation terminal, provided by private firms which can charge as much as $30 for 40 minutes of screen time. On prison phone companies, Securus Technologies says in its marketing materials that it has paid out 1.3 billion in these so-called commissions over the past 10 years. Horizon Health, one of the sponsors of the Louisiana Prison Trade Show, is the country's largest prison health care firm. It treats more than 300,000 prisoners nationwide earning about 1.4 billion in annual revenue. There's also the subject of numerous investigations in lawsuit. Many prisons and jails basic commissary items like cereal and canned soup can cost five times the retail price, as the country's inmate population has ballooned, so has revenue. Prison policy initiative estimates that the commissary companies earn 1.6 billion per year. There are just a few companies that are each earning billions of dollars a year off of the prison system. Again, if you look at this 11 billion number and cross-reference it with the 55 billion that it costs to house inmate, it looks like there's a deficit. But then when you consider all of the other companies and organizations that are involved and have hands in making money in the prison industry, begin to connect the dots and start to realize that it's very lucrative for a lot of different industries for people to be in prison. For example, Apple. A iPhone, Apple does not manufacture the screens, Apple does not make the batteries, does it make the camera sensors, Apple didn't even manufacture the processor. Long line of a bunch of different companies came together to make the iPhone and it is sold as an Apple device. Even though in the US there are public and private prisons, all prisons are basically private prisons. As even public prisons outsource a lot of the operations to third parties that are private businesses. Just looking at the revenue that is made by this state does not give you a full picture of the situation, it doesn't give you a full picture of all of the different industries that are involved in making the prison industry work. Is way more than just billions of dollars at play here? Take into account all the food vendors, all the cell phone communication companies. The fact that a lot of maintenance that's done to prisons, that a lot of people cite as being very expensive is done by prisoners and is done for no pay. We may never truly know the actual dollar amount of all of the free labor that prisoners are providing for America. For very obvious reasons. Just like how we may never know the true exact dollar amount of all of the free labor that was provided by Africans during slavery in America. Now it's a fuck ton of money. We also have a lot of reasons to believe that it's even a fuck ton more than the fuck ton we already know that it is. Point here is there is nothing but incentives for the government and corporations to work together, collude if you will, to lobby and change laws to make it so that more people end up in prison.

US prisoners often have to. Let's unpack about 65% of inmates in US federal and state prisons work. That's according to a recent report. They either do prison maintenance or industrial jobs, where they produce goods for their companies. The US has a minimum wage, but it doesn't apply for prisoners. Yet the report estimates that prison labor generates 11 billion dollars with the goods and services a year. It also found that if inmates refuse to work, they are often punished. They may have their visiting hours reduced, or even be sent to solitary confinement. The report says that many prison workplaces lack even minimal labor protections. Like safety trainings or protected gear. In Germany, prisoners use to make less than $3 an hour. But the court recently ruled that prisoners must be paid a better wage.

In this decision, the Court concluded that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act does not include a so-called private right of action, a right that has been implied by the courts for many years. This means that only the federal government and not private groups or private parties can bring suit for a violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. You heard that right. Under today's decision, when minorities are disenfranchised through practices by the state or the federal government that discriminate against them on the basis of color, race, or language minority, only the federal government and specifically the attorney general's office can sue and not private individuals. This is a problem because it jeopardizes the ability of countless minorities across the United States to see their vote counted, because currently the vast majority of cases regarding the Voting Rights Act are brought to court through private groups. Additionally, this decision puts 100% of the power to bring lawsuit in the hands of the attorney general, and we know that the attorney general's office has discretion on whether to bring any suit to light or not. This decision is not only obviously very dangerous, but also very startling because it's a clear departure from established jurisprudence from the way courts traditionally decided in these matters. And here is the other problem, because the circuit is split between this decision and decisions in other circuits that have recognized a private right of action, this ruling will certainly be headed for the U.S. Supreme Court. And if you think a decision in this case is clear, think again, because in 2021, a Supreme Court ruling included a concurrent opinion by Justice Gorsuch that said that with that decision, the court wasn't at that time making any implied guarantees that a right of private action actually existed. That means that at least the portion of the bench is open to hearing arguments to decide whether the right of private action in those instances actually exists or should be called non-existent. In the mean time, this decision will stand in a 8th circuit, a decision that was authored by a Trump appointee with the concurrent opinion of a Bush appointee. The only lone dissenting judge, a Bush appointee, was the actual chief judge.",subjective,voting

When your politics becomes who you are, we can't debate that. Real hard to change. And the Trump magic trick is that he made folks think this is who they are. They are maga.

MAGA, what does that mean? It's been used so much as a political tool, so let me explain what it means. MAGA is an ideology. It's a statement. It's a feeling. It's a belief. It means make America great again. I can't imagine in a million years why there would be anybody that wouldn't support that statement if they're American. But it isn't a person. It isn't an organized group. You're lumping American citizens into something negative because they want to see our country great again. Won't you really process that? It's different than saying Black Lives Matter. We all agree Black Lives Matter. But the organization that uses those words is corrupt, and they do nothing for the Black community.

So if you're letting these politicians use something like that to divide us, then you should ask yourself why you disagree that we shouldn't make America great again. And then you should be out really giving BLM a hard time because the statement or ideology they should represent isn't what they represent. This is a twisted world where politics is being used. And every angle to change the way you perceive reality reality as long as we're divided as long as making America great again isn't a universal thought. Then they can divide us, separate us, use us how they wish. When you're tired of it, when you're tired of the infighting and understand that these politicians and our government works for us, all of us, we can stop it. But it's going to take outrage. So I'm outraged because they don't want to make America great again. So what does that say about them? What does it say about you?",subjective,american ideology

She told me that her little daughter took that vaccine, that injection, and she suffered from mental retardation thereafter. Some of you might not remember who that is, and no, she's not another Maga rep or some rogue school or director. That's Michelle Bachman, a former congressperson and tea party celeb. And as she sounds like today's Maga chorus, it's because they're singing from the same book of him's. So how did the tea party pay the way for Maga to take over American politics? Well, let's rewind to 2009. America elected its first black president, Brock Hasein Obama. And the historic movement ignited a wave of political backlash for a thing, the tea party. A movement fueled by not so subtle racial undertones. They hated Obama. Because old Hasein here, bailed out the banks, homeowners, and the auto industry, but it didn't matter to them. Because beneath the banner of fiscal conservatism, the tea party's narrative was actually riddled with racist rhetoric, which laid the groundwork for a more blatant inclination via the lack of movement. And here is that Obama in 2008 was a symbol of hope. The tea party realized was that they didn't actually have to do anything. They just had to make sure that the ho didn't turn into action. It was a realization as powerful as it was dangerous. Because culture wars became the tea party's unexpected battleground. I'm trying to achieve a nationwide abortion ban to pushing for abstinence on the education. Its social policy maneuver set the stage for Maga's later more aggressive cultural crusades. Take the rhetoric around the Affordable Care Act, for example. Both groups loved hating on Obamacare. But neither could even come up with the draft of a plan B. Maga is basically the same script just with the different cast. The seats of conspiracy, sewn within the tea party's birthrism, blossomed into the Maga's movement's signature. Birthrism, by the way, for those that don't remember, was the baseless claim that Obama was secretly a Kenyan Muslim, which was rooted in nothing other than the fact that he was, you know, black. This wasn't just racist, Islamophobic, and xenophobic. It was a masterclass, in repeating something over and over again until people believe it. Which fast-forward to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we saw the exact same playbook. Ignore the facts and believe the hike. The Tea Party's art of obstruction turned into Maga's mantra. Its mutual distaste for politics as usual, brewed a perfect storm in which creating chaos trumped pun intended, any real policymaking. And that's because policymaking would have created solutions and solutions would have eliminated the madness that fueled its entire movement. Now another similarity between the Tea Party and Maga is that they were, and quite frankly still are, widely impopular. According to the Pew Research Center in October 2015, only 17% of Americans supported the Tea Party. And in March 2023, NBC found that only 24% had a popular view of Maga. So the Tea Party, the GOP's OG band Renegades, penned the started chapter for the Maga Sada. Its legacy was in just a political side show, but a shift in the GOP's soul. The party paved the way for Maga. Tea Party's louder, brashier sequel. It's like a created monster, one that swaps suits for red hats and political debates for cultural wars. And that my friends is how the Tea Party paid the way for Maga to take over American politics.",subjective,political back

Who do you want to take our country back from? We want to take it back from a congress and a president who forgotten that government derives his power from the consent of the government and instead is at the back and call it special interests and corporations. You describe the Tea Party as a grassroots movement, right? Absolutely. We have no central control, no traditional power structure, and that is something that seems to confound the media. I'm sorry? That's what confounds the media. It's what the media doesn't get. We are not being run by a George Soros type figure. We are we the people. There it is. If you follow the money, nearly all of it eventually leads to AFD. What is your funding come from? What little funding we have comes from private citizens who mail in $5, $10, $1, whatever they can spare. OK. Have either of you ever heard the name David Koch? I'm sorry? David Koch? No? Have you ever heard the name Charles Koch? No. Have you ever heard the name Koch Industries? Are you talking about Koch-O-C-H? K-O-C-H? Have either of you heard of Koch Industries? No. I think that very soon you will. Koch Industries is the second largest private company in the country, bigger than Koch-O-C-C-O-C-O-C. And the Koch Brothers personal wealth of $50 billion is exceeded only by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates and they could buy and sell George Soros 10 times over. They own dozens of companies in industries including oil and gas, refining chemicals, minerals, fertilizer, forestry polymers, and fibers and ranching.

This started happening at the beginning of the universe. This is a battle between good and evil, and you have to pick a side right now. And we don't need to know things, Brian, like that this week. Several actual scientific medical studies. I don't know if you all saw them, came out, that said that the drugs and the surgeries we are imposing are our children. Without them even understanding, without them even out in a license to drive a car, or to go to war, or to make a fear for crying out loud, the drugs and the surgeries were giving them, guess what? They're killing them. In all the welding numbers, that's the thing we didn't already kill them by forcing this God for taking jab on them. So this really isn't about parenting. It isn't really about education. It isn't really even about cultural issues as we like to call them. This is really just an epic battle that is heating up by the day, and I feel like it was magnified this week with the attack on our good friends in Israel. I spent time there too. I am half-tourish, fourth-tourish, I guess. And so I really think that this is with every single person, according to your faith, you must be on your knees in the full hour of God every single day as you engage in the battle. And you must be out-choked with no reservation. Nobody should calm down right now. We're not going to talk about moral equivalence because that's the lie. We're not going to listen to those who want to take our children, who want to be head-art babies, who want you to die, who want to kill Holocaust survivors in the streets. We're not going to listen to these people anymore. We're not going to calm down. There's one answer to this that God has given us for such a time as this. I want to tell you one quick facts story of how I came to support Donald Trump because at the time, I was on Fox News every day, I saw this man come to an event that would have changed something up. This was a debate. And I knew every other candidate on that stage and I had interviewed every single one of them and I had their cell phones in my pocket, their cell phone numbers in my pocket. Every single other person on that stage, I knew. And this is the very beginning, right? I didn't know Donald Trump from that. I never met him who didn't know anything about it except what I'd seen on TV. Love this reality show, right? Didn't know that at all. That's all changed, thank God. This is what I did with this and what has never changed about Donald Trump that pivoted me in that moment and it has never, ever changed. He stood in a room about this size. In that room, how many people in here, someone tell me, this is huge. 3,800. 3,800. Maybe it wasn't quite that big. Maybe closer to 2,000 people in that room that day. They had their cell phones, right? These were citizen journalists. I started with a tea party as a citizen journalist back when Obama had Obama hair. And I saw my country going down the drain and I didn't want any parties. I wanted to be a stand-home mom. I was married to a senator. I had a great life, had beautiful children. I said them around there. I told them around a park every day. Look at that human animal. That's the life I wanted. But they took it. They took that life. And I realized at some point, if I think I'm raising an army, there's going to be no country for my babies to fight in once I have my army raised. And that's the moment where that all changed for me. And that was the moment I came out and took part in founding the tea party movement. So this president, so I'm a very heartfelt citizen journalist, right? I didn't have professional cameras like I do now at Real America's Voice. I didn't have lights and speaking engagements and all that. All I had was my phone. And I watched this man Donald Trump. Nobody knows him. I tell this story very rarely because it's old. It's old. It's 2015. I watched him stand there. Ted Cruz gone. Ted Bush gone. Right? Took that question from ABC. ABC. CBS. Fox News.

She told me that her little daughter took that vaccine, that injection, and she suffered from mental retardation thereafter. Some of you might not remember who that is, and no, she's not another Maga rep or some rogue school or director. That's Michelle Bachman, a former congressperson and tea party celeb. And as she sounds like today's Maga chorus, it's because they're singing from the same book of him's. So how did the tea party pay the way for Maga to take over American politics? Well, let's rewind to 2009. America elected its first black president, Brock Hasein Obama. And the historic movement ignited a wave of political backlash for a thing, the tea party. A movement fueled by not so subtle racial undertones. They hated Obama. Because old Hasein here, bailed out the banks, homeowners, and the auto industry, but it didn't matter to them. Because beneath the banner of fiscal conservatism, the tea party's narrative was actually riddled with racist rhetoric, which laid the groundwork for a more blatant inclination via the lack of movement. And here is that Obama in 2008 was a symbol of hope. The tea party realized was that they didn't actually have to do anything. They just had to make sure that the ho didn't turn into action. It was a realization as powerful as it was dangerous. Because culture wars became the tea party's unexpected battleground. I'm trying to achieve a nationwide abortion ban to pushing for abstinence on the education. Its social policy maneuver set the stage for Maga's later more aggressive cultural crusades. Take the rhetoric around the Affordable Care Act, for example. Both groups loved hating on Obamacare. But neither could even come up with the draft of a plan B. Maga is basically the same script just with the different cast. The seats of conspiracy, sewn within the tea party's birthrism, blossomed into the Maga's movement's signature. Birthrism, by the way, for those that don't remember, was the baseless claim that Obama was secretly a Kenyan Muslim, which was rooted in nothing other than the fact that he was, you know, black. This wasn't just racist, Islamophobic, and xenophobic. It was a masterclass, in repeating something over and over again until people believe it. Which fast-forward to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we saw the exact same playbook. Ignore the facts and believe the hike. The Tea Party's art of obstruction turned into Maga's mantra. Its mutual distaste for politics as usual, brewed a perfect storm in which creating chaos trumped pun intended, any real policymaking. And that's because policymaking would have created solutions and solutions would have eliminated the madness that fueled its entire movement. Now another similarity between the Tea Party and Maga is that they were, and quite frankly still are, widely impopular. According to the Pew Research Center in October 2015, only 17% of Americans supported the Tea Party. And in March 2023, NBC found that only 24% had a popular view of Maga. So the Tea Party, the GOP's OG band Renegades, penned the started chapter for the Maga Sada. Its legacy was in just a political side show, but a shift in the GOP's soul. The party paved the way for Maga. Tea Party's louder, brashier sequel. It's like a created monster, one that swaps suits for red hats and political debates for cultural wars. And that my friends is how the Tea Party paid the way for Maga to take over American politics.",subjective,political back

Who do you want to take our country back from? We want to take it back from a congress and a president who forgotten that government derives his power from the consent of the government and instead is at the back and call it special interests and corporations. You describe the Tea Party as a grassroots movement, right? Absolutely. We have no central control, no traditional power structure, and that is something that seems to confound the media. I'm sorry? That's what confounds the media. It's what the media doesn't get. We are not being run by a George Soros type figure. We are we the people. There it is. If you follow the money, nearly all of it eventually leads to AFD. What is your funding come from? What little funding we have comes from private citizens who mail in $5, $10, $1, whatever they can spare. OK. Have either of you ever heard the name David Koch? I'm sorry? David Koch? No? Have you ever heard the name Charles Koch? No. Have you ever heard the name Koch Industries? Are you talking about Koch-O-C-H? K-O-C-H? Have either of you heard of Koch Industries? No. I think that very soon you will. Koch Industries is the second largest private company in the country, bigger than Koch-O-C-C-O-C-O-C. And the Koch Brothers personal wealth of $50 billion is exceeded only by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates and they could buy and sell George Soros 10 times over. They own dozens of companies in industries including oil and gas, refining chemicals, minerals, fertilizer, forestry polymers, and fibers and ranching.

This started happening at the beginning of the universe. This is a battle between good and evil, and you have to pick a side right now. And we don't need to know things, Brian, like that this week. Several actual scientific medical studies. I don't know if you all saw them, came out, that said that the drugs and the surgeries we are imposing are our children. Without them even understanding, without them even out in a license to drive a car, or to go to war, or to make a fear for crying out loud, the drugs and the surgeries were giving them, guess what? They're killing them. In all the welding numbers, that's the thing we didn't already kill them by forcing this God for taking jab on them. So this really isn't about parenting. It isn't really about education. It isn't really even about cultural issues as we like to call them. This is really just an epic battle that is heating up by the day, and I feel like it was magnified this week with the attack on our good friends in Israel. I spent time there too. I am half-tourish, fourth-tourish, I guess. And so I really think that this is with every single person, according to your faith, you must be on your knees in the full hour of God every single day as you engage in the battle. And you must be out-choked with no reservation. Nobody should calm down right now. We're not going to talk about moral equivalence because that's the lie. We're not going to listen to those who want to take our children, who want to be head-art babies, who want you to die, who want to kill Holocaust survivors in the streets. We're not going to listen to these people anymore. We're not going to calm down. There's one answer to this that God has given us for such a time as this. I want to tell you one quick facts story of how I came to support Donald Trump because at the time, I was on Fox News every day, I saw this man come to an event that would have changed something up. This was a debate. And I knew every other candidate on that stage and I had interviewed every single one of them and I had their cell phones in my pocket, their cell phone numbers in my pocket. Every single other person on that stage, I knew. And this is the very beginning, right? I didn't know Donald Trump from that. I never met him who didn't know anything about it except what I'd seen on TV. Love this reality show, right? Didn't know that at all. That's all changed, thank God. This is what I did with this and what has never changed about Donald Trump that pivoted me in that moment and it has never, ever changed. He stood in a room about this size. In that room, how many people in here, someone tell me, this is huge. 3,800. 3,800. Maybe it wasn't quite that big. Maybe closer to 2,000 people in that room that day. They had their cell phones, right? These were citizen journalists. I started with a tea party as a citizen journalist back when Obama had Obama hair. And I saw my country going down the drain and I didn't want any parties. I wanted to be a stand-home mom. I was married to a senator. I had a great life, had beautiful children. I said them around there. I told them around a park every day. Look at that human animal. That's the life I wanted. But they took it. They took that life. And I realized at some point, if I think I'm raising an army, there's going to be no country for my babies to fight in once I have my army raised. And that's the moment where that all changed for me. And that was the moment I came out and took part in founding the tea party movement. So this president, so I'm a very heartfelt citizen journalist, right? I didn't have professional cameras like I do now at Real America's Voice. I didn't have lights and speaking engagements and all that. All I had was my phone. And I watched this man Donald Trump. Nobody knows him. I tell this story very rarely because it's old. It's old. It's 2015. I watched him stand there. Ted Cruz gone. Ted Bush gone. Right? Took that question from ABC. ABC. CBS. Fox News.

My name is Jeff Barlett, and today's video is about my opinions on United States foreign policy. The first thing I'd like to say is that we need to enforce the Constitution of the United States of America. The President should not be allowed to go to war without congressional approval. I oppose the idea of the President using an executive order to go to war with other countries. And the other thing is, we should have never been in these wars in the first place to begin with. The government needs to stay out of these wars. The United States needs to focus on domestic policy instead of policing the rest of the world. The United States is not the world's policemen. The United States needs to stay out of these wars, stop wasting our taxpayer money on these wars, and we need to stay out of the business of these other countries. Now, I do think the United States should be improving relationships with other countries. I support diplomatic things. I mean, I support that the United States builds good relationships with other countries. I oppose sanctions because sanctions only hurt people in these other countries against the idea of the government putting sanctions on other countries. I think what we need to do is build good relations with these other countries and focus on building up our own country and focus on domestic policy. And as far as immigration, I support the idea of people coming here legally and we should have a pathway to citizenship for people who want to come to this country legally, of course, we should secure the border in an effective way. I didn't support Trump's immigration policy. I don't like how he did things with immigration. I support the idea of a pathway to citizenship for people in a legal way. I don't support just kicking out a certain group or anything like that. I think we need a good pathway to citizenship and secure the border to make sure people are legally coming in, not illegally coming in. And I'd like to thank you for watching this video.

The Tea Party was largely a reaction to Obamacare. Obamacare is of course not socialism, but conservatives lump it all together. Now it's one thing to oppose and protest against something, but like with Magga, the Tea Party was filled with anger, and I also had that anger. You wouldn't think opposing a social welfare program would generate that kind of vitri-haw, but this was obviously much deeper. So I grew up middle to lower middle class. My parents took care of me and I never really wanted for anything. They also wasn't spoiled and life since then has not exactly been easy. I bring this up because when you grow up this way, like most people, you don't feel privileged. And given how racial minorities and immigrants have been historically treated in this country, they've been marginalized and they're often the ones in need of assistance. So social welfare programs like everything else in this country are tied to race. See, the mindset is that life is hard for all of us and that no one deserves special treatment. So socialism is seen as a whole lot of special treatment. And the anger towards socialism is very simply from the feeling that you aren't being treated fairly. Selfishness is our natural state and it takes a lot of work to grow and see outside of yourself. Your own insecurities can also often be masked by anger and hate. And like I always say, the only remedy is love.",subjective,social welfare

But I don't think anybody really expected it to turn the tide completely. And then they won, and they took back Congress, and they realized that on their words, defeating the establishment was possible. And that gave them a ton of energy. And they now knew that they could win on the things that they believed in. And so when Mitt Romney lost, that was intolerable. Fast forward then to Trump, and he made everything possible for them. Even something that most never really thought they'd be able to touch, and that's Roe v Wade. Now they want to complete the mission.

She told me that her little daughter took that vaccine, that injection, and she suffered from mental retardation thereafter. Some of you might not remember who that is, and no, she's not another Maga rep or some rogue school or director. That's Michelle Bachman, a former congressperson and tea party celeb. And as she sounds like today's Maga chorus, it's because they're singing from the same book of him's. So how did the tea party pay the way for Maga to take over American politics? Well, let's rewind to 2009. America elected its first black president, Brock Hasein Obama. And the historic movement ignited a wave of political backlash for a thing, the tea party. A movement fueled by not so subtle racial undertones. They hated Obama. Because old Hasein here, bailed out the banks, homeowners, and the auto industry, but it didn't matter to them. Because beneath the banner of fiscal conservatism, the tea party's narrative was actually riddled with racist rhetoric, which laid the groundwork for a more blatant inclination via the lack of movement. And here is that Obama in 2008 was a symbol of hope. The tea party realized was that they didn't actually have to do anything. They just had to make sure that the ho didn't turn into action. It was a realization as powerful as it was dangerous. Because culture wars became the tea party's unexpected battleground. I'm trying to achieve a nationwide abortion ban to pushing for abstinence on the education. Its social policy maneuver set the stage for Maga's later more aggressive cultural crusades. Take the rhetoric around the Affordable Care Act, for example. Both groups loved hating on Obamacare. But neither could even come up with the draft of a plan B. Maga is basically the same script just with the different cast. The seats of conspiracy, sewn within the tea party's birthrism, blossomed into the Maga's movement's signature. Birthrism, by the way, for those that don't remember, was the baseless claim that Obama was secretly a Kenyan Muslim, which was rooted in nothing other than the fact that he was, you know, black. This wasn't just racist, Islamophobic, and xenophobic. It was a masterclass, in repeating something over and over again until people believe it. Which fast-forward to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we saw the exact same playbook. Ignore the facts and believe the hike. The Tea Party's art of obstruction turned into Maga's mantra. Its mutual distaste for politics as usual, brewed a perfect storm in which creating chaos trumped pun intended, any real policymaking. And that's because policymaking would have created solutions and solutions would have eliminated the madness that fueled its entire movement. Now another similarity between the Tea Party and Maga is that they were, and quite frankly still are, widely impopular. According to the Pew Research Center in October 2015, only 17% of Americans supported the Tea Party. And in March 2023, NBC found that only 24% had a popular view of Maga. So the Tea Party, the GOP's OG band Renegades, penned the started chapter for the Maga Sada. Its legacy was in just a political side show, but a shift in the GOP's soul. The party paved the way for Maga. Tea Party's louder, brashier sequel. It's like a created monster, one that swaps suits for red hats and political debates for cultural wars. And that my friends is how the Tea Party paid the way for Maga to take over American politics.",subjective,political back

Several actual scientific medical studies. I don't know if you all saw them, came out, that said that the drugs and the surgeries we are imposing are our children. Without them even understanding, without them even out in a license to drive a car, or to go to war, or to make a fear for crying out loud, the drugs and the surgeries were giving them, guess what? They're killing them. In all the welding numbers, that's the thing we didn't already kill them by forcing this God for taking jab on them. So this really isn't about parenting. It isn't really about education. It isn't really even about cultural issues as we like to call them. This is really just an epic battle that is heating up by the day, and I feel like it was magnified this week with the attack on our good friends in Israel. I spent time there too. I am half-tourish, fourth-tourish, I guess. And so I really think that this is with every single person, according to your faith, you must be on your knees in the full hour of God every single day as you engage in the battle.

We're not going to listen to these people anymore. We're not going to calm down. There's one answer to this that God has given us for such a time as this. I want to tell you one quick facts story of how I came to support Donald Trump because at the time, I was on Fox News every day, I saw this man come to an event that would have changed something up. This was a debate. And I knew every other candidate on that stage and I had interviewed every single one of them and I had their cell phones in my pocket, their cell phone numbers in my pocket. Every single other person on that stage, I knew. And this is the very beginning, right? I didn't know Donald Trump from that. I never met him who didn't know anything about it except what I'd seen on TV. Love this reality show, right? Didn't know that at all. That's all changed, thank God. This is what I did with this and what has never changed about Donald Trump that pivoted me in that moment and it has never, ever changed. He stood in a room about this size. In that room, how many people in here, someone tell me, this is huge. 3,800. 3,800. Maybe it wasn't quite that big. Maybe closer to 2,000 people in that room that day. They had their cell phones, right? These were citizen journalists. I started with a tea party as a citizen journalist back when Obama had Obama hair. And I saw my country going down the drain and I didn't want any parties. I wanted to be a stand-home mom. I was married to a senator. I had a great life, had beautiful children. I said them around there. I told them around a park every day. Look at that human animal. That's the life I wanted. But they took it. They took that life. And I realized at some point, if I think I'm raising an army, there's going to be no country for my babies to fight in once I have my army raised. And that's the moment where that all changed for me. And that was the moment I came out and took part in founding the tea party movement. So this president, so I'm a very heartfelt citizen journalist, right? I didn't have professional cameras like I do now at Real America's Voice. I didn't have lights and speaking engagements and all that. All I had was my phone. And I watched this man Donald Trump. Nobody knows him. I tell this story very rarely because it's old. It's old. It's 2015. I watched him stand there. Ted Cruz gone. Ted Bush gone. Right? Took that question from ABC. ABC. CBS. Fox News.

My name is Jeff Barlett, and today's video is about my opinions on United States foreign policy. The first thing I'd like to say is that we need to enforce the Constitution of the United States of America. The President should not be allowed to go to war without congressional approval. I oppose the idea of the President using an executive order to go to war with other countries. And the other thing is, we should have never been in these wars in the first place to begin with. The government needs to stay out of these wars. The United States needs to focus on domestic policy instead of policing the rest of the world. The United States is not the world's policemen. The United States needs to stay out of these wars, stop wasting our taxpayer money on these wars, and we need to stay out of the business of these other countries. Now, I do think the United States should be improving relationships with other countries. I support diplomatic things. I mean, I support that the United States builds good relationships with other countries. I oppose sanctions because sanctions only hurt people in these other countries against the idea of the government putting sanctions on other countries. I think what we need to do is build good relations with these other countries and focus on building up our own country and focus on domestic policy. And as far as immigration, I support the idea of people coming here legally and we should have a pathway to citizenship for people who want to come to this country legally, of course, we should secure the border in an effective way. I didn't support Trump's immigration policy. I don't like how he did things with immigration. I support the idea of a pathway to citizenship for people in a legal way. I don't support just kicking out a certain group or anything like that. I think we need a good pathway to citizenship and secure the border to make sure people are legally coming in, not illegally coming in. And I'd like to thank you for watching this video. Please subscribe if you want to see more videos. Please share this video with your friends.

I strongly support the First Amendment of our Constitution. One thing I oppose is when the government starts locking down cities or the whole area of a government or whatever jurisdiction it is. I oppose the idea of lockdowns when people start protesting. Now I do support that the police should go in and stop violent protestors in a peaceful way and a civil way. I don't support violent protesters. They need to be in jail. Anyone who does violence to protest, they belong in jail. They don't punish the rest of the people living in an area because some knuckleheads are being violent. Throw the knuckleheads in jail. Don't punish the people who have to live near it or anything like that. I oppose that. But I would like to say is that we need to support our right to peacefully assemble.

Parents should lose control of the Embryos they created. You want the state to decide what happens to those Embryos rather than parents will create. That's not at all what I'm saying. What I'm saying is at the time that they're seeking to create and become pregnant that they're just creating the Embryos for that initial pregnancy. If that's not successful at that time, then they can come back and create for that particular pregnancy, but not create a big giant where you have 15 to 20 Embryos that are then having to be stored for eternity. Additional Embryos are often created because the first text I understand why they do that, but that again it leads to the reckless storage and disposal of human life. The state should decide what happens to those Embryos rather than parents. They're there to get pregnant. They're there to create a life in the womb and it needs to be that particular life. We're really in Alabama basically putting state in charge of the disposal process or what the term of what happens to them. And all the IAF and the IAF and the IAF and the IAF are shut down.

Now, for those of you who follow my page first, thank you for that. But you might be thinking, Lisa, did you just tell us like two days ago that the House and the Senate leadership had just agreed to a more than one and a half trillion dollar deal to avoid this shutdown? Yes. Yes, I said that. And the deal is real. But I also told you in that very same video, the far right Republican House Freedom Caucus was pissed about it. They did not like this deal at all because it did not include the drastic budget cuts they wanted or the strict border policies they wanted. And today about a dozen of them flexed their muscle. They voted down a simple procedural step that would have moved this deal forward. So where does that leave us? On January 19th, a large piece of the United States government will shut down. The rest of the government will shut down on February 2nd unless Congress passes several funding bills known as appropriations bills. Now, this is not a matter of passing one big huge bill to avoid the shutdown. Before January 19th, Congress would need to pass four appropriations bills through both the House and the Senate. And then the remaining eight appropriations bills would need to be passed before the rest of the government shuts down on February 2nd. At this point, they've passed zero appropriation bills. Zero of them have been passed through the House and the Senate. And here's the thing. In the Senate, things just take longer. So one piece of legislation typically takes about a week to pass through the Senate. So you do the math. If there are four bills, that would technically take four weeks. And we have nine days. So just yesterday, Senate Republicans said the House and the Senate need to pass another stopgap measure called a continuing resolution so they can kick the can down the road for a certain amount of time and give themselves more time to get these appropriation bills passed before the government shuts down. But Speaker Johnson isn't a fan of this plan and the same conservative House Republicans are saying absolutely no way will they go for that again. And in case you're keeping track, yes, this is exactly the same series of events that led to former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy being kicked out of his job. A consensus of Republicans have not said that they want to kick Johnson out yet. But at least one conservative Republican said it's definitely a possibility. And generally, I can tell you the Republicans are not happy with Johnson at least not right now. So who knows how this is going to be fixed in just nine days.",subjective,government shutdown

Doesn't say Congress may overturn an election result, it doesn't say Congress can do whatever the heck it was with this election, shall count the votes. That's what the Constitution says. In her CrossFit class, maybe they didn't cover that. And the Constitution also says that the impeachment of a president shall be based on trees and high crimes misuse.

The lawsuit concerns a 2021 executive order by President Biden. This executive order basically says, hey, federal agencies, you need to consider ways on how to increase access to voter registration and voter information. It also concerns the September implementation and introduction of automatic voter registration by Governor Shapiro. So there's a federal law that says all the MVs you have to be able to register to vote there when you know you're getting your license and stuff. So previously in Pennsylvania when you went in there would be a prompt on the computer that says do you want to register to vote if you hit yes, then it took you to the form. However, now when you go in to renew your license or get a license, it automatically takes you to the voter registration form. And then obviously you can opt out if you don't want to register to vote. Pennsylvania has already seen a 44% increase in voter registration for this time compared to the same time period two years ago. Historically states that have implemented automatic voter registration, someone's called voter voter have seen massive increases in voter registration and it's been very effective. And lastly, the lawsuit concerns a 2018 state directive by then governor Tom Wolf and that basically directed counties to say that you could not throw out someone's application to register to vote solely because their driver's license number or their social security. Number did not match what was in the computer database.

So one piece of legislation typically takes about a week to pass through the Senate. So you do the math. If there are four bills, that would technically take four weeks. And we have nine days. So just yesterday, Senate Republicans said the House and the Senate need to pass another stopgap measure called a continuing resolution so they can kick the can down the road for a certain amount of time and give themselves more time to get these appropriation bills passed before the government shuts down. But Speaker Johnson isn't a fan of this plan and the same conservative House Republicans are saying absolutely no way will they go for that again. And in case you're keeping track, yes, this is exactly the same series of events that led to former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy being kicked out of his job. A consensus of Republicans have not said that they want to kick Johnson out yet. But at least one conservative Republican said it's definitely a possibility.

When Marjorie Taylor Green was teaching CrossFit, she learned a whole different set of values, evident because my idea of what this country should be like is based on the Constitution, and she sees the world differently. She's criticized me for voting to certify the election in 2020. The Constitution says Congress shall count the votes. Doesn't say Congress may overturn an election result, it doesn't say Congress can do whatever the heck it was with this election, shall count the votes. That's what the Constitution says. In her CrossFit class, maybe they didn't cover that. And the Constitution also says that the impeachment of a president shall be based on trees and high crimes misuse. It doesn't say it's a political exercise and we hope that it does the right thing. And so I get tired of people.

The lawsuit concerns a 2021 executive order by President Biden. This executive order basically says, hey, federal agencies, you need to consider ways on how to increase access to voter registration and voter information. It also concerns the September implementation and introduction of automatic voter registration by Governor Shapiro. So there's a federal law that says all the MVs you have to be able to register to vote there when you know you're getting your license and stuff. So previously in Pennsylvania when you went in there would be a prompt on the computer that says do you want to register to vote if you hit yes, then it took you to the form. However, now when you go in to renew your license or get a license, it automatically takes you to the voter registration form. And then obviously you can opt out if you don't want to register to vote. Pennsylvania has already seen a 44% increase in voter registration for this time compared to the same time period two years ago. Historically states that have implemented automatic voter registration, someone's called voter voter have seen massive increases in voter registration and it's been very effective. And lastly, the lawsuit concerns a 2018 state directive by then governor Tom Wolf and that basically directed counties to say that you could not throw out someone's application to register to vote solely because their driver's license number or their social security. Number did not match what was in the computer database. The lawmakers who filed the lawsuit say that these three actions either required legislative approval, which was never gotten or they conflict with existing Pennsylvania law.",subjective,voter

Zero of them have been passed through the House and the Senate. And here's the thing. In the Senate, things just take longer. So one piece of legislation typically takes about a week to pass through the Senate. So you do the math. If there are four bills, that would technically take four weeks. And we have nine days. So just yesterday, Senate Republicans said the House and the Senate need to pass another stopgap measure called a continuing resolution so they can kick the can down the road for a certain amount of time and give themselves more time to get these appropriation bills passed before the government shuts down. But Speaker Johnson isn't a fan of this plan and the same conservative House Republicans are saying absolutely no way will they go for that again. And in case you're keeping track, yes, this is exactly the same series of events that led to former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy being kicked out of his job. A consensus of Republicans have not said that they want to kick Johnson out yet. But at least one conservative Republican said it's definitely a possibility. And generally, I can tell you the Republicans are not happy with Johnson at least not right now. So who knows how this is going to be fixed in just nine days.",subjective,government shutdown

Ouch! Listen to this. Marjorie Taylor Green came out and said we played the sound yesterday that she's like, I'm not voting for any budget bill, no continuing resolution, nothing that doesn't involve the defunding of Jack Smith's special counsel office and everything that he's doing. Do you feel similarly about that issue as you do to defunding the FBI and the ATF and the DEA, etc? So George, when I was teaching law school, I learned and taught certain constitutional principles. When Marjorie Taylor Green was teaching CrossFit, she learned a whole different set of values, evident because my idea of what this country should be like is based on the Constitution, and she sees the world differently. She's criticized me for voting to certify the election in 2020. The Constitution says Congress shall count the votes. Doesn't say Congress may overturn an election result, it doesn't say Congress can do whatever the heck it was with this election, shall count the votes. That's what the Constitution says. In her CrossFit class, maybe they didn't cover that. And the Constitution also says that the impeachment of a president shall be based on trees and high crimes misuse. It doesn't say it's a political exercise and we hope that it does the right thing. And so I get tired of people. One of the beauties of Congress is you bring 435 people together from different backgrounds and you try to reach a consensus on issues. When you've got people who care more about their social media accounts than they do about the Constitution, we have a real problem in Congress.",subjective,political ideology

This is going to be really hard for me to get through without laughing. I'm warning you guys right now. A vote was taken to remove Marjorie Taylor Green from the House Freedom Caucus for some of the things she's done. Republican Representative Andy Harris told Politico, adding that Green's support for House of Representative Speaker Kevin McCarthy may have also contributed to her ouster from the Hardline group. Harris declined to say how he voted but called the decision to remove the Georgia Congresswoman who is in her second, two-year term, and appropriate action. Well, that tells us everything we need to know about the Freedom Caucus, right? A club where Marjorie Taylor Green isn't right-wing extremists enough to stay in. Unbelievable. But after the news broke out, she put out this tweet. Only American citizens should be voting in American elections. That's why I introduced the DC Voter ID Act to safeguard election integrity. My bill will make it mandatory to provide a photo ID when voting in DC elections and ensure only American citizens are casting ballots. I don't think it's a coincidence that she's talking about voter fraud after being voted out of the Freedom Caucus. And you know what I just found out? Lauren Vovert is the Communications Chair for the Freedom Caucus. Because she's like so freaking awesome at communicating. What a shit show. Oh, I kind of actually feel bad for Marjorie. It can't be easy watching the Freedom Caucus pick the other pick me bitch. You know, if you right-wing extremists keep it up, you might push Marjorie Taylor Green to be a Democrat. Oh, get it together Stella, you're a professional. It's important to note that this is the first time a member has been voted out of the Caucus. So Marjorie, at least you're a pioneer for something.

Because hell, half no fury like Marjorie Taylor Green scorned. I mean, that's why her hair is so frizzy. It's full of secrets. And I have a big feeling she's gonna sing like a Christian Canary. Maybe they'll replace her with George Santos. After all, he fits all the requirements. And he's got the experience. He led the first Caucus in 1796.

The lawsuit concerns a 2021 executive order by President Biden. This executive order basically says, hey, federal agencies, you need to consider ways on how to increase access to voter registration and voter information. It also concerns the September implementation and introduction of automatic voter registration by Governor Shapiro. So there's a federal law that says all the MVs you have to be able to register to vote there when you know you're getting your license and stuff. So previously in Pennsylvania when you went in there would be a prompt on the computer that says do you want to register to vote if you hit yes, then it took you to the form. However, now when you go in to renew your license or get a license, it automatically takes you to the voter registration form. And then obviously you can opt out if you don't want to register to vote. Pennsylvania has already seen a 44% increase in voter registration for this time compared to the same time period two years ago. Historically states that have implemented automatic voter registration, someone's called voter voter have seen massive increases in voter registration and it's been very effective. And lastly, the lawsuit concerns a 2018 state directive by then governor Tom Wolf and that basically directed counties to say that you could not throw out someone's application to register to vote solely because their driver's license number or their social security. Number did not match what was in the computer database. The lawmakers who filed the lawsuit say that these three actions either required legislative approval, which was never gotten or they conflict with existing Pennsylvania law.",subjective,voter

And the news is that we are headed for a government shutdown and a presidential impeachment. The first thing that happened when we all got back last week was one of the leaders of the right flank gave a big speech on the floor of the house. It was a speech directed to the leader of his own party in the house, the speaker. He basically said, hey Mr. Speaker, if you pass a budget that our group doesn't like, we'll fire you. We've got the votes to end your speakership and we will call a vote every single day until you're gone. But what he really meant was, look, we know you're going to pass a budget this year and we're not going to like it. So you have to give us something we want or we'll fire you. The number one thing they want is a shutdown because a shutdown comes with a ton of media attention for them. And as I've told you for a lot of them, media attention is the whole ballgame. People who had changed last week was the right flank basically saying that a shutdown wouldn't be enough. They wanted something more. Impeachment. The speaker really didn't want to give them that, but he did. Technically, he just began the impeachment investigation, but if he doesn't go through with impeachment at the end of the investigation, the right flank would just threaten to fire him again and he'll do it. So basically, in exchange for being able to pass a budget at some point this year, the speaker is trading his right flank, a shutdown and an impeachment. The reason the speaker doesn't want to do either of those things is he's worried they're going to hurt his party in the next election and he wants to grow his majority. Right now he only has a majority by five votes, which has made his life a living nightmare because it means he just gets taken hostage over and over again by his right flank. Meanwhile, his right flank knows that if he's successful in growing their majority, ironically, it just means less power for them, which is why they're fine forcing the speaker to do things that could backfire in the next election. Having a narrow majority lets them remain the decisive faction. And if forcing a shutdown for media attention seems like a really weird strategy, it's because you're not the target audience. The target is voters who get almost all of their news from certain cable news shows. That's who this whole maneuver is built for. It's a swivever of politicians working with a swivever media to reach a swivever of voters. And if you're not in that small group, then none of this makes any sense. So that's the latest, and I'll keep you posted.",subjective,government shutdown

I thank my friends here who have been for a long time making clear to the American people that it's time for things to change in Washington. Now, we've been saying that for a long time and finally January we did something about it and we forced to change and the American people responded. And for five months that change was being seen because we were a unified Republican party standing up for the things that we actually run on. Actually trying to change this place, actually trying to secure the border, actually saying that if you're going to raise the dead ceiling, maybe you should actually enact fiscal reforms to do so. We did that. We worked in good faith. Everybody's sitting around working around the table to accomplish the objectives, the American people sitting here to do. Unfortunately, last week there was a breach. There was a breach in the structure that we agreed to put in place to make sure that we are representing the American people through this here to four United Republican Conference. The Republican Conference right now has been torn a sunder. And we are working hard to try to put it back together again this weekend by making sure that this bill gets stopped. I want to be very clear. Not one Republican should vote for this deal. Not one. If you're out there watching this, every one of my colleagues, be very clear. Not one Republican should vote for this deal. It is a bad deal. No one sent us here to borrow an additional $4 trillion to get absolutely nothing in return. But at best, if I'm being really generous, a spending freeze for a couple of years, that's it. That's about what you get. And frankly, you're going to make things worse and my Democratic colleagues know it. That's why they're supporting it. That's why they're going around gleeful. There's a reason our Democratic colleagues support this. There's a reason that Mitt Romney supports this. There's a reason that Bill Crystal supports this. It's all the same stuff. There's a reason that our conservative allies are opposing it. Roundly, the club for growth, scoring against it, the Heritage Foundation, scoring against it, freedom works, scoring against it, Ron DeSantis publicly opposed President Trump said he thought we should default rather than pursue this kind of lunacy. At the end of the day, the only person that would default in this town is Joe Biden unless Republicans default on the American dream by voting for this bad bill. That is why this group will oppose it. We will continue to fight it today, tomorrow, and no matter what happens, there's going to be a reckoning about what just occurred unless we stop this bill by tomorrow. There is a reason why 100 Democrats, none of which voted for our initial bill, is now forward. Why is that? It's because they got what they wanted. And Kevin McCarthy had done a good job speaking the language. His number one slogan is, National Death is the biggest threat we have to America. That's out of his words, then to pass this bill. The Biden McCarthy deal has been dubbed the Fiscal Responsibility Act. But in truth, there's nothing responsible about it. Make no mistake, this is the Fiscal Irresponsibility Act. We wanted to cut spending so much we would never have to do it. But we came together with the provisions of the limit-safe-grow bill to raise a debt ceiling by a responsible 1.5 trillion in exchange for some $56 trillion of cuts over time. Then, while we were not participating, without the participation of the Republican body, you have our own leadership. Come together and jettison drop, dismiss all the provisions of the limit-safe-grow bill and come up with what the Democrat position was three months earlier. Raise a debt limit with no conditions. This deal makes default more likely in the future. A true default is when you can no longer borrow, you can no longer service your debt, you can no longer meet your obligations, and this deal makes it more likely, with a $3-4 trillion increase over the next year and a half. Every Republican should oppose it, no Republican should vote to validate, affirm, and own Biden's agenda. And that's what this bill does. Well, we are focused. I'll let each member speak for themselves, but for me, I am focused on defeating this bill. What happens post that and the agreements that we have, we will decide once we determine the disposition of this bill and its finality. There are two paths here. Take up the bill that we passed. It's a good bill. It's sitting over the Senate. They can pass it and Senate the President. Second, Speaker McCarthy should pull this bad bill down. We should stop taking this bill up right now. I don't think he even has a majority of his own conference at this point. We'll find out later today. He should pull this bill down, and then we should do exactly what we're doing right now. We have COVID resisions. Right now, COVID resisions are in the bill. COVID resisions of $29 billion. They've already taken that in this bill, and they've swept $22 billion and just set it over to the Department of Commerce for play money. Take that money, take IRS money, and go tell Janet Yellen, you're going to pay every bill you need to pay, and we're going to sit down at the table and do the job for the American people. But don't tell me you're going to put me over a barrel for $4 trillion because you refuse to do your job. That is what Speaker McCarthy should have told the President of the United States. We are dealing with the bill right in front of us. You can talk to these folks and anybody else you want to after this press conference individually.

So let's talk about it. In order for the federal government to operate, there has to be a federal budget. This makes sure that the services that we all use continue to operate and that federal staff gets their paychecks. Now the budget process happens every year. And if Congress can't come together on an agreement for the next year's budget, the government shuts down. Here's why that's important right now. The last day for the current budget that we're under right now ends at the end of the month. And we're not even close to a deal for the next one. Now, there's a reason for this. There's a group in the House of Representatives that's threatening everything. They're called the Freedom Caucus. Now, they've come together with this grand list of demands that have no chance of ever getting passed. Now just so you have an idea what I'm talking about, they're trying to take billions of dollars away from disaster relief and wage a war on wokeism or whatever that means. Now this group is not the majority of Congress, but it's big enough to blow everything up. Now, these members know very well that their demands have no chance of actually passing, but they want chaos anyway. Because you see when there's chaos, there's attention. Because when a government shutdown happens, you'll see it on all of the news channels. You'll hear people talking about it inside of the lunch lines. You'll see it truly become a topic of conversation. And with all of that attention, what do you think's going to happen? New fire brands are going to come up that are going to get all of this attention with their base. It's all a racket. And what makes all of this so frustrating is that while male carriers can't get their paychecks, while government agencies start slowing down because people are not showing up to work, because they're not getting paid. These members of the Freedom Caucus that are forcing the government to shut down are be sitting in their comfy chairs in their office, doing their media interviews completely unaffected. And that is unacceptable. Because this whole thing, our entire lives, is nothing more than a game to them. We've got to get more serious people in the government to stop this kind of stuff from happening. But in the meantime, I'll keep you updated with what's going on. Hopefully we can get a last minute deal to stop the gridlocks so we can stop the shutdown. But we'll see.",subjective,government shutdown

They're demanding a amendments that threaten a woman's access to abortion. They're demanding amendments that roll back LGBTQIA plus rights. They're demanding amendments that undermine diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The freedom caucus doesn't care about freedom when it's a woman's freedom to make their decisions about their own bodies, or someone's freedom to love who they want or be who they are. Or people's freedom to not get shot at school, or at a grocery store, or at a mall. America needs to understand who the freedom caucus is and what they stand for. They do not care about your freedom. They care about their own freedom. They care about their freedom to do whatever the hell they want to do. And looking at how extreme most of the Republican amendments are that were made in order, I'd be surprised if this bill could even pass the House. I fear what this final bill is going to look like because of the amendments they are making in order today. This is honestly a disaster. And I have never ever wanted to hear lectures about process ever again. Well, Mr. Speaker, before I light up the Republican conference for an absolutely awful process that made a series of offensive amendments in order to block some very reasonable amendments, I do want the record to reflect that I have the deepest respect and affection for the gentleman from Oklahoma. He always sounds reasonable in part because he is a reasonable person. Unfortunately, he is surrounded by members who are not reasonable, who are not rational, who are not fair. For the second time this week, Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee was unexpectedly called back at 11 o'clock last night. We then sat and waited over an hour for the meeting to actually get underway, all because Republicans couldn't get their act together. Republicans had to have yet another backroom meeting, another midnight seance to resurrect this rule. Because it does not so far write MAGA wing nuts, once again, through a fit and hijacked the bill when they realized they weren't going to get a bill that was perfect to them. It should go without saying, but it's outrageous that a tiny minority of Republicans is getting to dictate exactly what amendments come to the floor. It's outrageous that the Rules Committee last night managed to mess up a bipartisan bill and put it on a path toward becoming a hyperpartisan one by loading it up with every divisive social issue under the sun. And here's my word of wisdom to Republican leadership. When you have a razor thin margin in one half of one branch of government, you don't get your way on everything. Democracy means compromise. Divided government means compromise. And compromise means you don't get everything you want. There has to be a give and take. And I have to admit, I have never, never, in all my time here, experienced in NDAA process is outrageously bad as this one. This bill passed out of the House Armed Services Committee by a vote of 5821. Let me repeat, it passed with a bipartisan vote of 5821. You know, when I was chairman, Democrats made an order over 650 amendments. Democrats made an order over half of all amendments submitted because we believed in the radical idea that we ought to. And I don't know, actually do our job and debate things. And Republicans in this NDAA have made an order fewer than a quarter of all the amendments submitted. In fact, despite a record number of amendments emissions this year, they made an order fewer amendments than every Democratic-led NDAA. And what's worse, these are the worst of the worst amendments. They block dozens of dozens of common sense ideas, but they paved the way for the most radical amendments. And in the rule that we are considering today, they made an order 70 Republican amendments, six bipartisan amendments, and get this drumroll please, one, two, three, four, four Democratic amendments. Now, some of these amendments made an order were submitted minutes before we held our markup. And for all my Republican friends who ran in rave about how important it is to provide enough time for members to read and understand what they are voting on, we had minutes. As I said, it's not just the number of amendments,",subjective,policy debate

Republican representative Andy Harris states that the vote was taken to remove Marjorie for, quote, some of the things she's done. He doesn't go into specifics and he also doesn't state how he himself votes, but the vote passed. She's out. He also states that her support of Speaker McCarthy probably also didn't help her in the vote. Harris said that the, quote, straw that broke the camel's back was the way she referred to another member. Let's not forget that that happened because Lauren put in the articles of impeachment for Biden before Marjorie could. So Marjorie got mad because she wanted to do it.

Kevin McCarthy and other spineless Republicans are initiating an impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden, despite the fact that they know that Joe Biden has not formed impeachable offense. Well, why is all this happening? Within Congress, we have a little group called the Freedom Caucus. They are often taunted as a fringe party within the Republican Party. However, what I like to call them is the people in the Republican Party who are willing to say out loud that things are public and say they are high-closed doors. If you have ever heard of the paradox of intolerance, when we tolerate intolerant parties, the intolerant party will do everything they can out of desperation to gain more power and consolidate it into their hands in order to eliminate their opposition. AKA, the tolerant. And in this scenario out loud, these people have claimed that as immigrants, LGBT people, and non-Christians. So I just want to frame that for you real quick. What does this have to do with the impeachment inquiry? Well, in order to consolidate this power, they have to continue to make sure that they completely eliminate any trust that we, as people, have more public institutions. Which granted, with the way they've been going, they're doing a great job. Because the Justice Department has done these investigations into Trump, because Trump was impeached on valid terms twice. And because there are tons of indictments against Trump and his little, um, uh, co-conspirators right now, uh, the Republican Party has no choice but to double down and support their frontrunner by completely using these same avenues, um, as political theater to try to make you distrust them because they're not going to find anything in Joe Biden. And they want you to just think that any impeachment thing is whack, right? They just really want you to think that any kind of investigation to a president is whack. If you can do it, we can do it too. They want you to feel like all this stuff to vilify Trump is invalid. Which obviously is not the case. I also want to draw your attention to the fact that Project 2025 has been a very big topic here on TikTok. If you're not familiar, there are a bunch of conservative thinktakes, specifically the Heritage Foundation, I'd like to focus on today, that craft a lot of the legislation that gets brought in through Republicans and the Freedom Caucus here in the United States. Uh, and yes, I'm telling you that Marjorie Taylor Greene is not writing her own, uh, policy. I know that that is shocking to you. Um, but this is all to say, they and a bunch of other conservative thinktanks as well as some congress people, some academic scholars, etc have outlined their plan of how they would like to completely, uh, so distrust in our institutions eliminate the, um, federal bureaucracy would like to completely deregulate the economy and ultimately destabilize our lives as middle to lower class Americans and also people with marginalized identities. Uh, if you think I'm joking, they very much want to establish a christo fascist regime here in the United States and they want to consolidate power into one authoritarian president. This is not a lie. They have this all outlined in their multi-step plan of how they like to do that. And the steps that they're taking right now are all a part of this plan to continue to so doubt in our institutions. So if this is something that you want to learn more about, I suggest you look up project 2025. Um, and I also suggest that we all get a little bit more savvy looking at what the Republican Party is doing and not completely diminishing the tactics that they're using as just political theater because they are actually sowing the steps right now to continue to try to get a Trump presidency or any Republican presidency in order to establish a christo fascist regime here in the United States. Anyway, consolidate a little three-minute spiel. Wanted to let you know that that's going on. Wanted to help you kind of sew together how all these things connect. If you have any questions, drop them down below and I'm happy to talk about them further. Peace, love and cheese.",subjective,political manipulation
